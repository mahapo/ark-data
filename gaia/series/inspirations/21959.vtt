00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are coming to you
live from the Gaiam Studios

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage you-- this
is an interactive live show.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So please, communicate
with us and connect with us

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.336 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
We'd love to hear
with you-- hear

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:90%
from you throughout the show.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So today we're talking
about self help.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And we talk a lot on the
show about self help.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But today is a little bit
of a difference slant.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We're talking more about
the kind of self help

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that's not so much
self, but more help.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
The kind of self
help that combines

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
social and personal
transformation, that

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
creates systems for change
in our personal lives

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
as well as in our world.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And joining me is Riane Eisler.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
She is a pioneer in the
study of complex systems.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
She is a futurist, an activist.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And she is a cultural historian.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
She's been recognized as
one of the top 20 macro

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
historians in the world.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
She's written about new systems
for change in her iconic books,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Challenge and the
Blade" and "The Real

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Wealth of Nations."

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Riane.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.032 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RIANE EISLER: It's a great
pleasure to be with you, Lisa.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a wonderful
honor to have you here.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.524 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Thank you.

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:31.398 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I want you
to start, if you could,

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
sharing your-- a little
bit of your story, which

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:90%
is so immense.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it really shaped who you
are now, about you growing up.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well you
started, really,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
by saying something
that is something

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
we had better pay attention
to-- that we can't really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
separate our own
personal well being

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
from the society
in which we are.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that rather
traumatically very early

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I was born in Europe
at the time of the rise

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to power of the Nazis, first in
Germany and then in my native

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Austria.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So that from one day to
the next, we really--

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean there was
always anti-Semitism.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
we really became

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
hunted, with license to kill.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very little girl
when a gang of Gestapo men

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
stormed into our house,
dragged my father off.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And I saw two things there.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.845 align:middle line:84%
One of course, I
saw the cruelty.

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:34.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:35.469 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: And the violence.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As a small child,
that's a lot to handle.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But I also
saw in my mother

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
what I today call
spiritual courage.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're told that
courage is the courage

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to slay the enemy,
kill the dragon.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But she displayed what I
today call spiritual courage--

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the courage to stand up
against injustice out of love.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
She recognized
one of the men who

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
came as a young man who had been
an errand boy for the family

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:90%
business.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.963 align:middle line:90%
And she got furious.

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
She said, how dare you
do this to this man who

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:90%
was so good to you.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.969 align:middle line:90%
I want him back.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Now she could have been killed.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Many people were
killed that night.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
But by a miracle she wasn't.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
By a miracle she managed
to get my father back.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.846 align:middle line:84%
And by a miracle we
escaped at night.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All of
that is a miracle.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you were looking
at your mother in that moment,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
of her pleading for
her husband back,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
did that imprint on
you at that moment,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
that she was courageous?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I think that
when we're children

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
we don't put it into
words, when we're little.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.447 align:middle line:84%
Our brains really
don't process that way.

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that
feeling came through.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yes, that
feeling came through.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I've
been told that that's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:90%
what my work is really about.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Standing up against
injustice out of love.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But those experiences
really led me to questions

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
about does it have
to be this way?

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all
asked these questions.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I try to answer them
using the conventional studies

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and all the
university education.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it
was these questions,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
whether there are
alternatives to this,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that animated my
research that I've now

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:90%
been doing for several decades.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you have done
so much for women's rights.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You have done so much to raise
awareness for equal rights

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and for-- to expose the
dominator versus partnership

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:90%
model.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But in a way that,
you said, that's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
very, very, very
important for me-- and I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
have a very strong listening
for-- you do it out of love.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
You do it in a way that is
easy for us to understand.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
You do it in a way that
does not exclude people,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
but includes everyone
in the conversation.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is the example of what
you teach, which is beautiful.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you are a young mother,
and you're raising children,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're a single mom, and
you're working very, very hard.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And you somehow had to bring
that courage again, once again,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.205 align:middle line:84%
to raise young children as
a single working mother.

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I have had
many turning points in my life.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I quit my
marriage, my job, and smoking

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
in a period of three months.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was done.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.527 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yeah.

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.026 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And really, I was
at that time just rebelling.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.791 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't know
where I was going.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:33.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Against what?

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Against
the whole thing,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to be the
little woman behind the man,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't express myself.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But I was also rebelling in a
sense against all the injustice

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that I saw.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a job
in Beverly Hills.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.632 align:middle line:90%
You know, I mean--

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were an attorney.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yes, I
was an attorney.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
I'd gone to UCLA Law School.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And aside from my training
as a systems scientist

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and a social scientist,
I was an attorney.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And really, I started to
understand something else

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
at that point, which
is that as much

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
as having been born Jewish--
well it had almost cost me

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
my life, that's how much it
affected me-- having been born

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
female had impacted my
life choices just as much.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And I-- it was
interesting because it

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
was at a time of
consciousness raising

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
when the women's liberation
movement got going.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
so many problems

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that I thought were my
own personal problems

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:84%
were actually social problems
because I shared them

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:90%
with so many women.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Such as?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I
was always being

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
told something is wrong with
me because I wanted something

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.425 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hmm.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I mean, in those
days you went to a party,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and people would ask
you what do you do?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And we would say,
I'm just a housewife.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Well today, I realize
that being a homemaker

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
is probably the
most important job.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that both men and women

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.915 align:middle line:84%
should do, the caring work,
the caring for children.

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yeah.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But it was
very interesting.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I was very stressed because
I was doing everything.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching at UCLA.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I was lecturing.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:90%
I was working as an attorney.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:90%
I had my two little girls.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And I got very sick.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.417 align:middle line:84%
Both my parents
died very suddenly.

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
sort of like it--

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, goodness.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --for me.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
kind of had to decide

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that-- just,
why do women put themselves

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
in that situation, Riane, where
we have to be the martyrs?

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Where we have to be
everything to everyone?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
What is it about social
and cultural issues

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that make some women-- and I'm
speaking in stereotypes as well

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.055 align:middle line:84%
here-- think that we have to
be everything to everyone?

00:08:02.055 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, it's
our socialization.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We're socialized-- we
have been socialized

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
to focus on relationships.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
As a daughter first, then as
a wife, and then as a mother--

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
always in relation to a man.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Rather than really
thinking of ourselves

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:90%
as autonomous human beings.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to tell you
is, at that point in my life,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
what I wanted to do

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
was to get back to the
questions of my childhood.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
And so I started this research.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And I took a big gamble.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.525 align:middle line:84%
And it was 10 years of
research for "The Chalice

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and the Blade."

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:42.649 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Multi-disciplinary,
cross-cultural.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I came out with
a really-- sort of thinking

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
outside the box, to use the
cliche-- understanding that

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to move forward, we have to
get out of the old thinking.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, Einstein said
you can't solve problems

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
with the same thinking
that created them.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was still trying to
figure out right/left, religious

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:90%
or secular, Eastern or Western.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Competition, division.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yeah.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
None of these-- but
it wasn't just that.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It was like all of these
categories that do not

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
take into account the relations
without which we would not

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:90%
be here.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The relations between the female
and male half of humanity,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and between them and
their daughters and sons.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was really-- people
tell me they read my work,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.697 align:middle line:84%
and it's like an aha--
ton of aha moments.

00:09:33.697 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So it was
for me in my research.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I suddenly
realized these

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:90%
are the foundational relations.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience tells us that
what children experience

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and what they observe,
which are really,

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
when they're little--
shapes everything, including

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:90%
even how their brains develop.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And how what we think
is normal or abnormal,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
possible or impossible,
and moral or immoral,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%
is shaped by that.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a way
of seeing the world

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.512 align:middle line:84%
where one half of humanity is
ranked over the other half--

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:12.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --that's a
template for all rankings,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
be it not just man over
woman, but man over man,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
race over race,
religion over religion.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
coincidental, by the way,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that the people who want to push
us back to the so-called good

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.201 align:middle line:84%
old days, when all women and
most men knew their place

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:90%
in these rankings-- top-down--

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --rankings.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They always want to go back to a
quote traditional family, which

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is a code word, isn't it, for a
rigidly male-dominated, highly

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
punitive family.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.185 align:middle line:84%
Which is training for what
I call a domination system.

00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which we've
seen so much of.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We've seen in history, time
and over and over again

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.267 align:middle line:90%
in our history.

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's by understanding
that history

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to then go
forward and create what you're

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:90%
talking about, is partnership.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Is real social change.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.255 align:middle line:84%
Is changing the
environment completely.

00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Right.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Because really, trying
to-- we hear so much

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:90%
about healing ourselves.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book called
"The Power of Partnership."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But, all this self
help, if you really

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
don't look at the conditions
under which you live,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
your society, your
economic system,

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
your educational
system, your religion,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
your political
system, your media--

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.575 align:middle line:84%
it's like trying to go
up on a down elevator.

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can't help yourself
at all in those environments.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.161 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: No.

00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:36.865 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, that's why we
have so many self help books.

00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we're really
like fish swimming upstream.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.499 align:middle line:84%
It really can't be done
in that environment.

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I mean, so, first
thing is awareness of this.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing is really
doing not only the self change,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
which is very
important, but also

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
to work for that economic and
social and cultural change.

-This distinction between
the partnership and dominator

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
models comes out of my
research over three decades,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
multi-disciplinary
research looking

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
at a large span of our cultural
evolution that is reported

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in part in my book "The
Chalice and the Blade."

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
This research addresses
fundamental questions

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that many of us have asked,
questions that in my life

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
came out of my experiences as
a little girl in Nazi Austria.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Questions such as, do we have to
hunt and persecute each other?

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
When we humans have such an
enormous capacity for caring,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
for creativity, what is it
that has tilted us back?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Don't we have any
alternatives to this way,

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that is so often presented to
us as just the way things are?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Out of this research
the answer came.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:90%
We do have alternatives.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot see these
alternatives unless we look

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
at human history
through a wider lens.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
What we begin to see is that
societies-- whether they're

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
ancient or modern, Eastern
or Western-- that orient more

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
to the dominator model, we
see that the primary principle

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
for organizing
relations is ranking.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Man over woman.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Man over man.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Race over race.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Nation over nation.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Man over nature.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But as you move more towards
the partnership model,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see a different
governing principle: linking.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
There are still hierarchies.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
There are still very clear
lines of responsibility

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and leadership.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But leadership is not
based on the power

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to dominate, to control
through fear, through force.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It is not dis-empowering,
but empowering.

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's a
very important point.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful
that a dad is asking.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Because that takes us
to one of the movements

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen
towards partnership,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.519 align:middle line:84%
which is the movement of
more men really raising

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:90%
the children.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it used to be wait
til your father gets home.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
domination system.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.153 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:57.153 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it
robbed men, didn't it,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of that pleasure, those
endorphins-- you know,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
these neurochemical
rewards of pleasure--

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that we get for caring.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: So thank you.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Mark, for
asking that question.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an easy question
because there are resources out

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We, for example, at our
website, partnershipway.org,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
have a wonderful
parenting guide based

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:90%
on the latest neuroscience.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Caring and
Connected Parenting Guide."

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I really highly
recommend that,

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
not only for you, but for
anybody that you know.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because so much of
what we're trying to do

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
is to unlearn some
of the old patterns

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and learn some of the new ones.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
This said, there's
also the culture again.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.078 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: What's going
to be taught in schools.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And again,
I wrote a book called

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
"Tomorrow's Children"
on education

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:90%
for a partnership world.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's address
that for a second.

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Because education in
the traditional sense

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
is very much of the
dominator model.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It is very much of the
top down, tier leveled,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
you're on the top,
and then here's

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%
the rest of us type of thing.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.697 align:middle line:90%
How do we change that?

00:16:16.697 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And well, first of
all, let me ask you

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
about the history of it.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.262 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the
domination system, you mean?

00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.636 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In education
specifically.

00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: In education
specifically.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you have a
domination system,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
it happened when we
shifted to that system

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
during our prehistory, something
that I write about extensively

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in both "The Chalice and the
Blade" and in "Sacred Pleasure"

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and in other books.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, you have
to educate, socialize people

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to fit into this system of top
down, rigid top down rankings.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
European Middle Ages,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
they looked like the Taliban,
you know, the Inquisition.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
The Crusades.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
The holy war, the jihad.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The witch burnings-- you
know, whether you slowly stone

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
a woman to death or
torture her by fire.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Women had no rights.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.524 align:middle line:84%
Children were supposed
to be seen, not heard.

00:17:14.524 --> 00:17:15.367 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So were women,
as matter of fact--

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and to look good while
they were being seen.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
where our education

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.498 align:middle line:90%
system was basically birthed.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So, I mean, even
as late as the 17th and 18th

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.157 align:middle line:84%
century, caning
children in school--

00:17:29.157 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --was
still acceptable.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And we still have about 18
states in these United States

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
where paddling
children is legal.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Mostly southern.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm afraid
to say that these

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:90%
are the so-called red states.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because they're
red or purple or green,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.671 align:middle line:84%
it's because there
the domination model--

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's still existing.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --is much stronger
than it is in other areas.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's really-- it's an
education appropriate for a--

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
what was then a monarchy,
a despotic regime.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, today if you
read about the way

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
that boys are educated in
some Muslim fundamentalist

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
societies, again
it's a lot beating,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:90%
a lot of indoctrination.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And they also get
educated in their homes.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Because children get very
much punished, you know.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They learn that
you had better not

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
question authority,
no matter how unjust.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And they also get
this model of men

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to dominate women.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Men are supposed to be served.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Well that gives you
a model, doesn't it,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
for any out group, for any
difference being equated

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
with being served, or serving,
dominating or being dominated.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you only have those
two alternatives, you get war.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
You get the war of the sexes.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we really need
to not only deconstruct and say

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.505 align:middle line:84%
what's wrong-- and not just
rebuild, but reconstruct.

00:19:00.505 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And reconstruct,
as you said, with heart.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't butt
up against a system

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that's already a
dominated system.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit about how

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that relates to our economic
system, which is also

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in that domination model
still very much so.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
How would you attempt to
change, to really make

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
true social change in
our economic system?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well first
of all, I think

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:84%
we have to leave aside
this old, dated argument

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:84%
between capitalism
and socialism.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
First of all, both
these theories

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
came out of industrial times.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're now in the
post-industrial knowledge

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
service era.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But also, both these
theories came out

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of times that still oriented
much more to the domination

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
side of the continuum.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So, if you
look at them-- See,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote "The Real
Wealth of Nations"

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
it was very clear,
again-- just as

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
right/left, religious/secular,
Eastern/Western

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
don't help us answer
what we need to do.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The same with socialism
and capitalism.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Because both do not
give visibility or value

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to the most
important human work,

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
which is the work of
caring for people,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
starting in early childhood,
and caring for nature.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:90%
The life sustaining activities.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's not in them.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have to move to a
whole new way of thinking,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
one that recognizes that
the real wealth of a nation

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
consists of the contributions
of people and of nature.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.815 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we need
what we haven't had.

00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What specifically
are you talking about?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you specifically
suggest this?

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we at the
Center for Partnership Studies

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.926 align:middle line:90%
have a Caring Economy Campaign.

00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:48.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:50.814 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And we have
a ton of materials.

00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
We also have them on our
website partnershipway.org.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And we are soon to have
a new website called

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:90%
"caringeconomy.com."

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But one of our attempts is
to change the measurements.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
How do we measure
economic health?

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.325 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that what's
not measured is not counted.

00:21:13.325 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So we are saying what
many other people are saying--

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:84%
but we take it to a different
and much more interesting

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:84%
place-- that GDP is a lousy
measure of economic health.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
it for a moment.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It includes activities that
actually harm and take life.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.887 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And increase
the domination model.

00:21:35.887 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well absolutely.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, making cigarettes,
the medical bills,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the funeral bills--
they're great for GDP.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But not only does that supposed
measure of economic health,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
which-- you know,
GDP keeps going up

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
while people lose their
jobs, their homes.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I mean, there's
no connection here.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons is that
it doesn't take into account

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the most important work, the
value of the work of caring

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:90%
and caregiving for nature and--

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For humans, in general.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --for
humans and for nature.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we are working on
what we call "social wealth

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:90%
indicators."

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have a meeting in
Washington, DC of experts

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to really see what-- look, our
nation, because we have really

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.255 align:middle line:84%
been regressing more
to the domination side

00:22:27.255 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
in the last decades,
has the highest poverty

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
rate of children of
any developed nations.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We have the highest
infant mortality

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:90%
rate of any developed nation.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We have the highest maternal
mortality rate of any nations.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
That's being first
in the wrong things.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.902 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, what you're
doing with your organization

00:22:46.902 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is basically
creating-- and we have

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
a slide about this--
about Caring Economics.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.582 align:middle line:90%
Six Steps to Caring Economics.

00:22:52.582 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Which is great,
because you make it

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
very easy for people
to understand.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And you also have a
Caring Economics Campaign.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.562 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- you are basically
growing leaders here

00:23:01.562 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:90%
with this conversation.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching people
what real wealth means.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well you
know, social change

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
takes place through
human agency.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And we can all be leaders.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer the age where
there's this one leader on top

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's whole
point, is that it's--

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.365 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: That's
the whole point.

00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So our Caring Economy leadership
training is an online program.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
leave your house.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
leave your chair.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a nine-week program,
one and 1/2 hours a week.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Tremendous resources you'll get.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:90%
You get training.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:90%
You do a practicum.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
out, and you change

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
the conversation
about economics.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.825 align:middle line:84%
And you tell people
what they need to know.

00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Through
your organizations,

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
through your individual efforts,
through what it is that you do.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Riane has done this
through all of her books

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that she has written, through
each book has a through line.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a stepping stone
process of where

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
you have gone from politics
through sex through economics.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've covered all
the bases and looked

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:84%
at the domination
versus partnership model

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:90%
in each one of these sectors.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I get a lot
of mail from people

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
who tell me that, really,
this way of looking

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.905 align:middle line:84%
at the world, these books,
have changed their lives.

00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yes.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Have been
very empowering to them.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Because they connect the dots.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In a practical way.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: In a very
practical a way.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In a way
that gives us steps.

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:84%
That gives us ways
to understand and how

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to make this type of
change in our world.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, out of
a result of all of this,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.270 align:middle line:84%
you ask the question what kind
of world would our children

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%
inherit?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is an absolute question
that comes out of all of this,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
through education,
through everything

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that we have discovered with
what you're talking about.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
What type of world will our
children and our children's

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:90%
children inherit?

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And that's
up to us today.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
that much time,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:02.360 align:middle line:84%
because the mix of high
technology-- of high technology

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
in service of the once-hallowed
conquest of nature,

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of high technology to
really exploit people more.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
That is potentially take us
to an evolutionary dead end.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean nuclear weapons
and the domination system

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.892 align:middle line:90%
are a potentially lethal mix.

00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dead end, absolutely.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So we've got
to really focus on that.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
passionate about this

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
not only through my research
and writing and speaking

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.744 align:middle line:84%
and activism, but as a
mother and a grandmother.

00:25:33.744 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And as a
mother and grandmother,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:84%
you get to also see
what types of issues

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.074 align:middle line:84%
and what type of images
the media shows us.

00:25:40.074 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're going
to look at some of the media

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
images that we see
out there and how

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.167 align:middle line:84%
they're affecting
gender equality.

00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.541 align:middle line:84%
You're watching

>>LISA: Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:90%
And my guest is Riane Eisler.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.297 align:middle line:84%
She is a social scientist
and an amazing woman.

00:26:18.297 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been having a
great conversation

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
about gender and
gender equality.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.765 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important to have
this conversation about gender?

00:26:25.765 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we've
been taught, really,

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.735 align:middle line:84%
that anything to do with gender
is just a women's issue, which

00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is kind of ridiculous because
we're half of humanity.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm glad you said that.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But the
reality is if you really

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:84%
look at the whole of
a social system, which

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
is what my research does, we see
that how a society constructs

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the roles and relations of
these two halves of humanity--

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
which is what women
and men are-- not only

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
affects directly our life
choices as women and men,

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
as girls and boys,
but that it affects

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:90%
everything about the system.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Our beliefs.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
What we are told is
valuable or not valuable.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
All of our institutions,
from the family--

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's authoritarian more
democratic-- religion, media,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:90%
politics, and economics.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And in my last book, "The
Real Wealth of Nations,"

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:27.920 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that comes
to the fore again and again

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason, really the
underlying reason that there

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
always seems to be
enough money for prisons,

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.875 align:middle line:84%
to punish, for wars,
and weapons to conquer--

00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's never questioned.

00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But there never seems
to be enough money for caring

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
for people, for health
care, for child care,

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
for paid parental leave-- is
because, in the domination

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
system, men are
ranked over women.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And anything
stereotypically considered

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
feminine, such as caring,
caregiving, nonviolence,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is also devalued, whether
it's in a woman or a man.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So men are wimps, they're
sissies, they're effeminate.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why should
effeminate be a pejorative?

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that unless
we see this hidden subtext

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
of gendered values, we
can't make sense of things.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most
important investment

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
as we move into the
post-industrial knowledge

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
service economy is what
economists keep telling us.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It is what they like to call
high quality human capital--

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
flexible, creative people
who can solve problems.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
That does not just
happen in universities.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We know from neuroscience
that the most important time

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:84%
for that to either happen
or not as our brains develop

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
is in early childhood care.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we are really to do what
every other industrialized and

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.730 align:middle line:84%
now post-industrial
nation is doing,

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:84%
invest in paid parental leave
for both mothers and fathers.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Government funded.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Invest in high quality
early childhood education.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:19.505 align:middle line:84%
The return on investment, the
studies show, on this is 200%.

00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:21.726 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Return on investment
for any corporation that

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:84%
supports that type
of child care.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: For any government
that supports that child care.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.223 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's very interesting.

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And we're

what we need to cut.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Well we will not be competitive.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We will not be competitive
in the new economy.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is not only a question
of doing what's right.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of not
committing economic suicide.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's really why we so need
what I call a Caring Economy.

and how there is such a wide
gap where it comes to care,

00:29:56.464 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to child care.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.645 align:middle line:90%

- Re-examining and
changing the valuations,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
the values that today
drive economic systems.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Now of course
economics really is

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:90%
about what is or is not valued.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And classical economists
will tell you, yeah,

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
but that is determined
by supply and demand.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And that is part of it.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But much more important are
the underlying cultural values,

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
values that are so
unconsciously embedded

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're often not
even aware of them.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Professions that do not entail
caring and caregiving-- they

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
can be done by caring
people, but the work

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:90%
is not caregiving work.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Engineering.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Plumbing.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
They are much higher paid than
those professions that do,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
such as child care,
elementary school teaching.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So in the United
States, people think

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.510 align:middle line:84%
nothing of paying the plumber--
the person to whom we entrust

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:90%
our pipes-- $50 to $100 an hour.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But the child care
worker-- the person

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to whom we entrust our
children-- according

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to the US Department of
Labor, gets an average

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
of less than $10 an
hour with no benefits.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course we
insist plumbers be

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
trained, but not that child
care workers be trained.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Now this is not logical.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:90%
It's actually pathological.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.277 align:middle line:90%

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to find a
way to change that.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is what you're
talking about today--

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%

change that into more

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%

One of the listeners
actually is asking--

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:90%
this is a great question.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Jan from Facebook is
saying, "how do you

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:84%

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: That's really
part of the regression

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to the domination side of the
continuum that we're seeing it.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not new
to objectify women.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It goes way back.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at Greek
vases and et cetera.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But what is new is the
explicit sexuality.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.366 align:middle line:84%
Now there's nothing
wrong with sex.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wrote a
whole book about that

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:90%
called "Sacred Pleasure."

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But it is really the erotization
of domination and violence

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
that's wrong with sex.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.622 align:middle line:84%
And that's our
dominator heritage.

00:32:45.622 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one way of
really getting a hold

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of people's-- because sex is a
very important part of life--

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:90%
is to say sex is bad.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
And women are temptresses.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:90%

But the other way is what we
see so much in the media today,

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
constant linking of sex with
domination and with violence

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and with the
objectification of women

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.605 align:middle line:84%
as just a sex object,
not a human being.

00:33:11.605 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It does
seem like there's

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:84%

that just keeps getting pushed.

I have a young

to figure out how

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to teach her to handle those
images that are coming at her.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:84%
No matter-- there's no
shielding a child from that.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You drive to school, and
there's 37 billboards

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of ladies that are--
barely have any clothes on.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And that's a
complete objectification.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's totally unrealistic.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
magazine for girls

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that is published by a company
called-- it's called New Moon.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's written
and edited by girls.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.040 align:middle line:90%

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I've given it always
to my granddaughters

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:90%

>>EISLER: What do
you say to her?

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:84%
You tell her that that

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
have been viewed
for a long time.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And that we really think
it's very unhealthy.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:84%
That you are much more
than your body parts.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Your body parts have
to be respected.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether somebody
sees them or not

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is something that you
have to determine,

whether somebody touches them.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.489 align:middle line:90%

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to come

>>EISLER: No.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:84%
But we need to also have
it in the institutions.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Because not all parents are
able to really deal with it.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather have their kids
watch violence on television

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
than sex, which I think, I
mean, doesn't make much sense.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it also has to do
with what you're talking about,

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:84%
our social conditioning
around all of this.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because this has now
become socially acceptable.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the norm.

It's the domination
model once again.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So how do we educate
ourselves in order

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.935 align:middle line:90%
to educate our children?

00:35:05.935 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we
educate ourselves

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
by looking at the
so-called sexual revolution

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that there
were healthy parts to it.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The acceptance that sex is
a normal, pleasurable human

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.890 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But then the part that was
tainted by our domination

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.336 align:middle line:84%
heritage is this notion
that women are now

00:35:25.336 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:90%
to be just available for men.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:84%
That that's how they
get their status.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.657 align:middle line:90%
That's how-- it's the old model.

00:35:31.657 --> 00:35:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's going back to that.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's
going back to that.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
sexualization of little girls

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:90%
has become a business.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:90%

clothes and all of that stuff.

Indoctrinating them
before their brains

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
are formed so they have
any critical faculties.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:90%
So yes, we've got a job to do.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.909 align:middle line:84%
But I always want you to
understand something here.

00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
important for all of us

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.370 align:middle line:84%
There's always this tension
between the partnership

and domination trends.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can strengthen the
partnership ones, for example,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:84%
by using resources
like New Moon.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, by
insisting that there

be real sex education that
talks about caring commitment

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in a sexual relationship,
that teaches

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:25.450 align:middle line:84%
both boys and girls that it's
not-- instant gratification

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is not what's going
to make a happy life.

>>LISA: In the long run.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you tell
that to a young boy,

they will tell you
that it-- I mean,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the social conditioning
is appealing

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
to the rising hormones

Yes.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: So.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.390 align:middle line:90%
But still.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have to teach
about the social conditioning,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.165 align:middle line:90%
more so.

00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this really--
I mean, do you really

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:54.999 align:middle line:84%
want that kind of a relationship
to both boys and girls?

00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting
because it's real.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.927 align:middle line:90%
It is what is happening.

00:36:57.927 --> 00:36:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It's what is all over our media.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.718 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly
what we're seeing.

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of leads us into
the conversation of the action

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:84%
plans that you
have and that have

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
been created with
your organization.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:84%
As well as the Caring Economics,
there's six areas for action

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.850 align:middle line:90%
that you propose.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I think
the first thing, really,

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
to re-examine what

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:84%
is a healthy economic system,
to change the conversation.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And yes, to start talking
about a caring economy.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And people are going
to say, caring?!

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that soft--

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --that soft fuzzy
feminine stuff, you know.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say, well,
that's just not effective.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So the second thing is really to
show how very effective it is.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
That companies that have
caring policies, companies

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that are regularly in the
Fortune 500 or the Working

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Mothers-- companies as the best
companies to work for-- that

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:84%
have caring policies,
that they have

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
a substantially higher
return to investors.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.921 align:middle line:84%
If people and their
families feel cared for--

00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They're
going to work very

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:84%
hard to make that
company successful.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they'll
want to keep that job.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.816 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And we
also have to look

00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:84%
at nations that have been highly
successful-- in human terms

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and in economic
terms-- in many ways,

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.150 align:middle line:84%
much more successful than
this very rich United States.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You explain the Nordic
nations are very supportive.

00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Iceland, Denmark--

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.760 align:middle line:84%
they all have more
caring policies.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And the thing-- They have paid
parental leave for both mothers

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and fathers.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Universal health care.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They have high
quality child care.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Their kids, by the
way, score very high

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.710 align:middle line:90%
in tests, international tests.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have low poverty
and low crime rates

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and a generally high
standard of living.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we
are not seeing here.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And they invested in
caring for their people.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And we come back
to gender again,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:84%
which is another one
of these steps showing,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:90%
really, the gender connection.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It's only because the
status of women rose.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because 40% of the national
legislature is female,

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:90%
say in Sweden, Finland, Norway--

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is very
different from here.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --that not
only women, but also men

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
voted for more caring policies.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.105 align:middle line:84%
So they call themselves
caring societies.

00:39:19.105 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
that the females--

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.469 align:middle line:84%
the mothers cannot get
the maternity leave unless

00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:84%
the fathers take
the paternity leave?

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: In Sweden, if it's
a woman-man family, yes.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.945 align:middle line:84%
If the father doesn't take
it, then neither gets it.

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, you see it
gives men the opportunity,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it, that we
spoke of earlier--

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --to the man who asked
the question about the child--

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --the father,
to really experience

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.120 align:middle line:90%
that bonding, that pleasure.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Look, what we really want
for both women and men is

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that we can each express
all of our potentials,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:90%
that women can be leaders.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.690 align:middle line:84%
That they can be
assertive and not

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.787 align:middle line:84%
be called ball breakers,
or whatever, bitches.

00:40:05.787 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.869 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And that men can
be caring and sensitive

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.320 align:middle line:90%
and experience the joy of that.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.602 align:middle line:84%
And we are establishing
new models all the time.

00:40:16.602 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
One of our listeners
here-- and I'm

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
encouraging your
questions via Facebook

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and Twitter-- Lynn is asking--
she retired as a teacher.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying
because she was fed up

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:90%
with the education system.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to know
how she can really

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:90%
effect social change.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:90%
How can she?

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, first of
all, I don't blame her

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:84%
for being fed up
with this teaching

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to the test, which is really
a regression to the domination

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.534 align:middle line:90%
It's again the ranking.

00:40:42.534 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Grading on tje curve
is the worst thing.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to fail.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And somebody has to be on top,
no matter how good you are.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.149 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to be on bottom.

00:40:50.149 --> 00:40:50.648 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And that takes
away from what really counts,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.427 align:middle line:84%
which is the teacher's
engagement with the child--

00:40:55.427 --> 00:40:56.510 align:middle line:90%
engaging, being partners--

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.301 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Empowering.

00:40:57.301 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --with the child.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:90%
But how can she?

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Social change doesn't
happen by Itself.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.940 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the European
Middle Ages, as I said,

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:90%
they looked like the Taliban.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We moved, but it happened
through human agency.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing is
changing the conversation.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:84%
The old terms for the more
rigid domination system,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.760 align:middle line:84%
the ideals of fealty,
obedience-- right?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And then we started
to talk about equality,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:90%
about democracy.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.644 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But we have to be very
careful, because like freedom.

00:41:31.644 --> 00:41:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is used by the
corporate interests that

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.960 align:middle line:84%
don't want regulation as
freedom for those on top

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.007 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever they want.

00:41:40.007 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.774 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And the same
thing in families.

00:41:42.774 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, the family
is supposed to have

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:90%
freedom from interference.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But what that really means
in a dominator family

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:90%
is that kids can be abused.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Women can be abused.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's only as we move
to the partnership side

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that you see the reporting
of spousal abuse.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
there's more of it.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:84%
It's that people are coming
out with it because we're

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.865 align:middle line:90%
moving to the partnership side.

00:42:04.865 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're also doing
that in an economics way.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
There's an old economic
map and a new economic map

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
here, that your organization
also talks about.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, that comes from
"The Real Wealth of Nations."

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the old economic map
really only included the market

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.950 align:middle line:84%
economy, the government economy,
and the illegal economy.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.425 align:middle line:84%
But it left out, as I said, when
we were talking about measures,

00:42:27.425 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the three
life-sustaining sectors.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have got
to include those.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to have these social
wealth economic measurements.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to
invite our viewers

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to become engaged in this, to
really take our Caring Economy

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:90%
online leadership program.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as the
former teacher said,

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:84%
how do we make
social change happen?

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We can't just do it
by deconstruction.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We can't do it by
just rebelling.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to also show what
needs to be reconstructed.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have to move
from this domination model

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.007 align:middle line:84%
more towards a
partnership model.

00:43:07.007 --> 00:43:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yes.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have to
find a way where

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
we can create this social
and cultural transformation.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.680 align:middle line:90%
But we have to do it how?

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Specifically how do we do this?

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, if you want
to change the economic system,

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
as I said, these are the steps
that we are talking about.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to start talking
about a caring economy.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And when people
do a double take,

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:84%
you remind them that
that reaction really

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.260 align:middle line:84%
shows how brainwashed
we've been,

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:84%
to accept a system guided
by uncaring values.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there are
some very specific steps.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Raising the status of women, as
you saw in the Nordic nations,

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.796 align:middle line:90%
leads to more caring policies.

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're dealing
with systems,

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.420 align:middle line:90%
you have to connect the dots.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It's interactive.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just one thing.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you happen
to be-- but see,

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.540 align:middle line:84%
the reason that these
Nordic nations moved more

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to a caring economy is
because they moved more

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.560 align:middle line:84%
from a domination to
a partnership system.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
They have more
democracy and equality

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.360 align:middle line:84%
in both the family
and the state.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
leave behind what

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:90%
keeps domination systems going.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Fear, force.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
The first peace studies,
the first laws--

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's illegal to use
physical punishment of children

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:90%
in families.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Men's movement to
disentangle masculinity

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:84%
from its association with
domination and violence.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And yes, a much more
equal partnership

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:90%
between women and men.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, as the
status of women rose,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:84%
men no longer found it such
a threat to their status,

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to their quote,
masculinity, to really

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:90%
also embrace more caring values.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great point.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can we
talk about the men?

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about the
fact that maybe they

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:84%
don't want to bear all
that responsibility.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to
share the parenting

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and be more part of
their children's lives.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to have
a dual-income family.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.125 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is something
that is desired.

00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well, it's two ways.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%

personal and the social.

Yes.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Because
the only reason

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that we are-- that more men
are doing the parenting,

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:90%
the mothering-- is

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.391 align:middle line:84%

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: You know, women
going into the workplace

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:84%
has really, in many ways, been
a very important influence

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in humanizing the workplace.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:90%

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well, yes.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the way from not
such austere surroundings

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to the movement towards
child care, towards--

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Partnership.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Towards partnership.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And also the movement
towards, really,

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
more caring and
nurturing leadership

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:90%
styles, which we are learning.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I teach leadership.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank goodness.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: The leader
that elicits from others

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.620 align:middle line:84%
their highest
potentials-- what I

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.670 align:middle line:84%
call in a hierarchy
of actualization

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.147 align:middle line:84%
rather than domination--
gets the best results.

00:46:29.147 --> 00:46:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And so this movement
towards a more partnership

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with the
changing of the gender roles

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and relations.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.230 align:middle line:90%

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

When we talk about
a caring economy,

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
there's a clip that comes from
the DVD "Tomorrow's Children"

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:84%
where Riane talks about--
specifically talks about what

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.430 align:middle line:90%
a caring economy is.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.020 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.570 align:middle line:84%
--Now, you've probably
noticed that just

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.040 align:middle line:84%
hearing "caring" and "economics"
in the same sentence,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.790 align:middle line:84%
people tend to do a
double take, don't they?

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a terrible comment
on the uncaring values

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.710 align:middle line:84%
we've learned to take
for granted as driving

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.010 align:middle line:90%
economic systems?

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.850 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have our
environmental, social,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and economic crises, global
warming, chronic hunger

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and poverty, if we had more
caring economic systems.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But it is today more
urgent than ever

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.710 align:middle line:84%
before that we shift to,
yes, to a caring economics.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we are in
the midst of a major,

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:84%
major technological
and economic and social

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:84%
shift-- the shift into the
post-industrial service

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:90%
information economy.

A time of seismic
technological changes,

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
when manufacturing and other
jobs are being eliminated

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.460 align:middle line:84%
by not just automation, but
at an ever more rapid clip

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.940 align:middle line:90%
by robotics.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.300 align:middle line:84%
A time when
economists never tire

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of telling us that the most
important capital-- yes, they

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.520 align:middle line:84%
call it capital-- for a
successful post-industrial era

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is what they call high
quality, human capital.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:35.100 align:middle line:84%
That is flexible,
innovative, creative people,

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.040 align:middle line:84%
people with highly
developed capacities.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But consider that
these capacities

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
aren't just developed in
universities, as important

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:90%
as that is.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not these capacities
are or are not developed,

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:84%
we now know-- not
only from psychology

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but from neuroscience--
depends to a huge extent

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
on the quality of
care children receive.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.730 align:middle line:84%

>>EISLER: I want
to say something

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:90%
very quickly about poverty.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the mass
of the world's poor

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and the poorest of
the poor are women.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Women in this country
over the age of 65,

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.270 align:middle line:84%
according to the US
Census, are twice as

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:84%
likely to be poor as
men of the same age.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's not only
job discrimination,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that's because most of them
are or were either full or part

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:90%
time caregivers.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And poverty is their reward.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:84%
If we're serious
about less poverty,

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.560 align:middle line:84%
we have to move to a caring

But we're at a place where
we had better move there now.

00:50:49.675 --> 00:50:50.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:50.385 --> 00:50:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of the
Facebook questions

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that's coming in from
Tina is basically

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:84%
saying that the domination model
has gotten so fierce right now.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Is this a last stand?

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
is maybe the end, because

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of its fierceness,
at this point?

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we would like to
think that, but I'm afraid not.

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what we see
in modern history

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is that, since moving
from the Middle Ages

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to today, where we have much
more partnership elements,

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.360 align:middle line:84%
is all the progressive
movements have

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.860 align:middle line:84%
challenged traditions
of domination.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, divinely ordained
right of kings to rule.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Divinely ordained
right of men to rule

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.070 align:middle line:90%
over women and children.

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Divinely ordained right of
one race to rule another.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.540 align:middle line:84%
All the way to man's
once-hallowed conquest

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.080 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, the right
to exploit, et cetera.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.185 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:36.185 --> 00:51:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But all
of this has been

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.190 align:middle line:84%
more of a spiral upward
movement with dips.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that we can be sure

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that there won't be anymore dips
is if we build the foundations.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And the foundations
have to do with what

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:90%
we've been talking about.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.180 align:middle line:90%
How are children brought up?

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it in dominator or
partnership styles?

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Caring
and Connected Parenting

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Guide we have is so important.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship between
the two halves of humanity,

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that children observe, which
is a model for all relations?

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Men and women.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Men and women.

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And some basics, like economics.

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:16.800 align:middle line:90%
What do we reward?

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.085 align:middle line:84%
What do we consider
valuable work?

00:52:19.085 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
actually a great clip

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:90%
that you quote Margaret Mead.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And she offers a
wonderful suggestion

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.677 align:middle line:84%
on how we could really create
change by working together.

00:52:29.677 --> 00:52:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

--I want to close
by reminding us

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.030 align:middle line:84%
of something that
Margaret Mead pointed out.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:84%
That the only thing that ever
brought about positive change

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is a group of dedicated
women and men.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's be that group of
dedicated women and men.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's join together to
really make that difference,

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to send a steady stream of
pressure and information,

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and yes, new thinking to our
policymakers, to our neighbors,

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to our friends, to everyone
in our sphere of influence.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's do what we
need to do to move

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.190 align:middle line:84%
to that economic system
that is so urgently needed

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:24.420 align:middle line:84%
at this critical time
in human history.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:84%
An economic system that
gives visibility and value

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to the most important human
work: the work of caring

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.920 align:middle line:84%
for people starting in
childhood and caring

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.880 align:middle line:90%
for our mother Earth.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to
join me and the Center

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.540 align:middle line:84%

this exciting and urgently

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:90%
needed enterprise.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it for ourselves,
for our children,

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and for generations to come.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

>>LISA: You are so inspiring.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And you are so motivating.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet that message is
so clear and so poignant,

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.400 align:middle line:84%
because there are things
that we actually can do.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a
caring economics.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It's, really, those two words
are beautifully put together.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They seem like
they're so opposite.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They're beautifully
put together.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Let's imagine
what the world can be like

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.250 align:middle line:84%
if we really have
a caring economy.

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not possible,
really, to change things

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.920 align:middle line:90%
unless we know what our goal is.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be specific.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It can't just be a better world,
and peace, and all of that.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It has to be how do we
change the rules of the game?

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.890 align:middle line:84%
How do we change
the measurements

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.040 align:middle line:90%
of what's economically valuable?

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.310 align:middle line:90%
How do we really do this?

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And we can do it.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:90%
