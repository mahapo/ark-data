>>LISA GARR: Do we go
anywhere after we die?

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Did our loved ones go
anywhere after they died?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there a collective passing
of souls after a tragedy causing

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:90%
collective grief?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
These and so many
questions have been

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
at the base of Dr.
Raymond Moody's research

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
into the near-death experience
for the past 50 years.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody founded the
field of near-death studies

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and named the
near-death experience.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
He described the near-death
and shared-death experiences

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
through his 12 bestselling
books sold to millions of people

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
And he's here with us to
share some of those questions

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:10%
based on his clinical
and scientific research.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.799 align:middle line:90%

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:10%

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I will share
with my audience

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that you were my
professor that helped

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
me discover that I had
a near-death experience

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.064 align:middle line:90%
several years after I had it.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:10%
And then, I got to write about
it and reverse engineer it.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I thank you in
person for helping me.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Thank you very much.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so many others.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So you've listened to
thousands and thousands

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of stories of people
who have shared

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:90%
or near-death experiences.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
After all of these
stories, do you

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.542 align:middle line:84%
believe that there are multiple
dimensions that we live in?

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well,
what I have to say

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:10%
is, before I went
to medical school,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:10%
I was a logician and
philosophy professor.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:10%
So this is just me.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:10%
But I can honestly tell
you that if you asked me

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:10%
if, for example, I believe
that there is life after death,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I would have to say no because
I haven't internalized it yet.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA:

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: But what I will say is
that I'm in a phase of my life

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:10%
where I have to give up.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I can say is
that it does appear to me

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:90%
I can't say I believe it.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been internalized
because it's still

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:90%
very counterintuitive.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: as a philosopher and
a logician, as you realize

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
there are countless
stories, wouldn't you

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:90%
put that together as evidence?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, it's
very hard to go

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
from stories to any sort
of claim about anything

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
beyond because of the
difficulties in logic

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:90%
However, at a certain point--

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:90%
well, let me explain.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Some years ago, I was in Italy.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:10%
And after my lecture on
near-death experiences,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:10%
an Italian surgeon
came up and led me away

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.922 align:middle line:10%
to the back of the room.

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And you could tell
that he had been

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:10%
through something which had
changed him very dramatically.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:10%
So in a very awkward
way, he told me

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:10%
that, some months
before, he had been

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:10%
doing an elective operation
on a fairly young man who

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:10%
was in overall good health.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So there was no thought of
anything untoward happening.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:10%
But in the surgery, the
man had a cardiac arrest

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:10%
and the doctor was
unable to revive him.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And so he was beside
himself saying,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:10%
you know, how did this happen?

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:10%
And what am I going
to say to the family?

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:10%
Whereupon he said the
operating room door swung open

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:10%
and a woman came screaming in.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.282 align:middle line:84%
At first, he thought
she was psychotic.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know how when
you're stressed out

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.239 align:middle line:84%
you can't make sense of what
somebody's saying anyway,

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
so he said he had to focus
on her face to figure out

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%
what is this woman saying?

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And he said he realized she was
saying, my husband is not dead.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:10%
She said, I was out
in the waiting room,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:10%
and my husband
came to me, and he

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:10%
said that you think he's dead.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And I'm supposed to come
in here and tell you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:10%
that he's not dead.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
So the surgeon told
me that he was so

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:10%
flabbergasted he
doesn't even remember

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:10%
resuming the resuscitation.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:10%
He went on automatic.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:10%
But after a while, lo
and behold, the heart--

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:10%
so he was there in
the recovery room

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:10%
when the patient
regained consciousness.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:10%
And he said the patients
looked at him and said,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:10%
Doc, I was up above
my body up there

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:10%
looking at you down
there, and I could

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:10%
tell you thought I was dead.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And I kept trying to tell you
I'm not dead, I'm not dead,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:10%
but you wouldn't hear me.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:10%
So I went out into
the waiting room

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:10%
to try to tell my
wife to come in here

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:10%
and tell you that I'm not dead.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:10%
Now I could give you
a dozen other stories

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:10%
of that character from
physicians who've empathically

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:10%
co-participated in the
near-death experiences

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:10%
of their patients.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:10%
And so I have to say I can't
think my way out of that one.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So I have to haltingly say there
appears to be life after death.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:10%
But it has not
internalized to me yet.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I am still not sure I want
there to be an afterlife.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.956 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, you
know, not coming

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:10%
from a religious framework, I
had developed my worldview sort

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:10%
of through astronomy,
actually, when I was a kid.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And I had grown
up with this idea

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:10%
that there's a certain
aesthetic quality of the story--

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:10%
the beginning, and the
middle, and the end.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:10%
And I was reconciled to that.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:10%
And it's a rather
startling notion to--

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was always interested
in the near-death experiences.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:10%
I always understood that
the patients were sincere.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I also understood
it wasn't brain damage.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:10%
Because people say, oh, this
is the oxygen flow cut off

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:10%
to the brain, and that's
not correct, in many cases,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:10%
because the identical
same experience happens

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:10%
to bystanders at the death
of someone else, who are not

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:10%
themselves ill or injured.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:10%
But when their
loved one dies, they

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:10%
say that they themselves
leave their body

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:10%
and go toward this light.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:10%
And so there's something
else going on here.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:10%
But what I have to say is that
I don't know whether I want

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:10%
it to be, but whether
I want it to be or not,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.695 align:middle line:10%
it looks like it is.

00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%

Of course, I have

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:10%
what the context would be, see?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.605 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's--

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:10%
Of course.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: can honestly
tell you here,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:10%
I say this all the
time to people,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:10%
and I lecture to
audiences of all ages.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:10%
And when I say this that
I'm going to tell you now,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:10%
I get very
interesting reactions.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:10%
And what I say is, I am sick
and tired of Raymond Moody.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Now when I say that
in a big audience,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I look at people who
are my age range.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.395 align:middle line:90%
And I see them.

00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But then, I see the
younger people, like,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
is he depressed or whatever?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:10%
So for those of you who plan
to face the '70s one day,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:10%
it's really neat.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's the happiest
time of life.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:10%
But the idea that I
would be Raymond Moody

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.602 align:middle line:10%
forever, and ever, and ever
is beyond horrifying to me.

00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Well, you've
got a little while left

00:08:18.183 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:10%
to go because you
have a lot to teach

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of incredible
stories to share with people.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of your journeys,
looking back in your life,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
was this incredible
journey to the Oracle

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead in Greece.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:10%
Now that had to have
been fascinating

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:10%
when you went to Greece.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Yeah, Yeah.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:10%
You see, the most interesting
series of events in history

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:10%
is the story of ancient
Greek philosophy.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
If you wrote that up
and wrote as an article

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and submitted it to
the National Enquirer,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
they would reject it because
it's too unbelievable.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But basically, my
first year in college I

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
learned that early
Greek philosophy

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
was connected with
these institutions

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that they called
"Oracles of the Dead."

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And the Greek comic playwright
Aristophanes and his play,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:10%
"The Clouds," specifically
accuses Socrates of calling up

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:10%
the spirits of the dead.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:10%
And many of these
early philosophers

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:10%
were supposed, in the
public mind at the time,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:10%
to be people who
evoked the dead.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew about these
oracles of the dead in college.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:10%
But in 1985, I read article
in a classical journal

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:10%
that the most famous of
the Oracles of the Dead

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:10%
had been rediscovered.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And based on what
they found there,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I was able to figure out
what they were doing.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically what they had
was a big bronze cauldron down

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
in a subterranean chamber.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was indirectly
lighted by torchlight.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:10%
And so they would fill
this big cauldron up

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:10%
and no doubt polished
somewhat on the inside--

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:10%
fill it up with
water and probably

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:10%
a layer of olive oil on
top because that's still

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:10%
how they do it.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.556 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: it could
create a mirror effect?

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: right--
in the Middle East.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:10%
And so under those
circumstances,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:10%
when you gaze into the optical
depth, you see visions.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:10%
Then, they had various
ways of getting you to talk

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:10%
about the person who died.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And I have reproduced this.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:10%
You can actually go
through a procedure

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:10%
where you actually seem
to see and converse

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:10%
with a dead relative.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
a great video of this,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and it is living
actually here on Gaia TV.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
David Hinshaw did
this great video

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:90%
called "Seeing the Unseen."

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at Raymond Moody
walking through this Oracle

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead in Greece.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Dr. Doceris, in
his search for the site,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:10%
surmised that in fact the
oracle was in the Northwest

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:10%
corner of Greece in Epirus.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:10%
Homer talks about the oracle
being located at a point

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:10%
where two rivers flowed together
to form the Acheron River

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:10%
and that there was
a pinnacle of rock.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:10%
All Dr. Doceris did was to trust
Homer and to go to the location

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:10%
that he believe Homer was
talking about, excavated,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:10%
and indeed did find this
subterranean complex there

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:10%
exactly at the location where he
surmised Homer had located it.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:10%
The institution
was subterranean.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
This was another factor in why
it was so long undiscovered.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:10%
Even in its heyday,
in antiquity,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:10%
it was entirely underground.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:10%
In approximately
160 BC, the Romans

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:10%
burned the Oracle of the Dead.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:10%
And at this point, this dropped
out of Western civilization

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:10%
as we know it.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Then, subsequently, in about
350 AD, the church banned it.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:10%
They made it anathema
for a Christian

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:10%
to believe that a spirit
can be seen in a mirror.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:10%
And so for that reason, we have
had no continuing tradition

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.716 align:middle line:10%
of evocation of the deceased
in Western civilization.

00:12:22.716 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That must have been
amazing to stand there,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.996 align:middle line:84%

times really saw and recalled--

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: --their lost loved ones.

00:12:34.826 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: It was very
moving to me, see,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:10%
because since I
was 18 years old,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:10%
probably the majority of books
I've read since that time

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:10%
of Greek philosophy and ancient
Greek culture, that's my--

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's just a fascination
to me since I was 18.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:10%
So when my wife
gets mad at me, she

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:10%
says, oh, just go
upstairs and play

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:10%
with your friends,
which means, like, read

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Plato and Aristotle and stuff.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:84%

major at 24 years old, right?

PhD in philosophy

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.685 align:middle line:84%

you became interested

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%
as a forensic psychiatrist.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:90%

fascination with that?

00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: In 1966, there
were two incredible murders

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:10%
in the United States.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:10%
One was the Speck killings in
Chicago, the nurses, and then

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:10%
the Whitman shootings at
the University of Texas,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:10%
where he killed, I
think, 17 people.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:10%
And I got interested
in homicide.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:10%
And then, in 1972 when I
went to medical school,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:10%
one of the first
things I did was I'd go

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:10%
and found the
forensic pathologist,

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:10%
which, at that time,
nobody wanted to do it.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:10%
So I would explain my
interest in homicide.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And so he would take me
along to murder scenes

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and let me assist in cases.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:10%
And then, I eventually worked
as a forensic psychiatrist

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:10%
in a maximum security
unit for the criminally

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:10%
insane with mostly paranoid
schizophrenic killers,

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:10%
but mass murderers and
occasional serial killers.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Serial killers, that's not
usually an insanity defense.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
That's more like sociopaths.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have
many of those, but we

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
had some really weird
ones when we did.

know, I went into this--

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:10%
to be conservative, I
probably, in my career,

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:10%
got to interview,
conservatively, say, like,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:10%
400 murderers.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
always fascinated

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:90%
with why people kill people.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wanted
to find out, but I give up.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.729 align:middle line:90%

The most interesting thing
about it, to me, was--

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:10%
because once you get
to know the judges,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:10%
then they will call
you in on other cases,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:10%
where my personal
friend or something,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:10%
and so I got a lot of people
who were not really psychotic,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:10%
but who had done these crimes.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
was just amazing.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:10%
You sit there and you--

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:10%
people whose judgment
you would trust

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:10%
in any other context,
when they start

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:10%
thinking about killing somebody,
their mind goes berserk.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:10%
It's like, I was sitting in this
little town in Georgia years

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:10%
ago and was involved in
a case of a businessman,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:10%
local businessman who, totally
out of character according

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:10%
to his friends,
killed his girlfriend.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:10%
But I was sitting there
looking at the records,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:10%
and I just looked up to the face
of the homicide detective who

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:10%
was sitting there with me.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:10%
And I just-- first time I
realized it, I said, you know,

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:10%
people think cops are stupid.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And he smiled, and
he said, we know,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and we use that information.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:10%
But it is amazing about--

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:10%
I really spend a lot of time
trying to figure out murderers

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:10%

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%

to the near-death study?

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You know,
it's interesting, Lisa.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I came across
near-death experiences

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
when I was 18 years old, reading
them and the work of Plato.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:10%
See, Plato was the first person
who wrote about this along

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:10%
with his contemporary
Democritus.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:10%
Democritus was the
guy who figured out

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:10%
that this is made of
little specks that are

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:10%
too small to see, like atoms.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And so he studied these
things, and he said,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as a moment of death.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, what this
is is that even when

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
the body appears dead, there's
residual biological activity.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But Plato, on the other
hand, took it seriously

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:90%
as indicator of an afterlife.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:10%
And we still have that
same debate today.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:10%
But that's how I got
interested in it.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:10%
And three years later
in 1965, I learned

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:10%
that right there in
Charlottesville, there

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:10%
was an actual living
person, Dr. George Ritchie,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:10%
who had had such an experience.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So he was the
first I interviewed

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
of subsequently thousands
and thousands of them.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you interviewed
him of his experience.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the people that have
these near-death experiences

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
seem to open up or access
different parts of their brain

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that they hadn't accessed prior.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: They do.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always say that
the experience that I had,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.254 align:middle line:90%
I can never unsee.

00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I recognized
or realized that there

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
are boundary-less, effortless
spaces that we live in

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
that we go in and out.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know that
that's my experience.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you
heard that many times?

00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there's all kinds
of things that opens up.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:10%
Most commonly people
say that whatever

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:10%
they were chasing before--

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:10%
knowledge, or power,
or fame, or money,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:10%
they realized that what this is
all about is learning to love

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:10%
and an occasional
after-effect is

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:10%
an inspiration to a creativity.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:10%
There's this amazing
man in England,

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:10%
David Ditchfield
is his name, and he

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:10%
is a phenomenal musician,
and composer, and performer,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:10%
who never had any
interest in music until he

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:10%
was swept under a train,
and run over by a train,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:10%
and had a near-death experience,
and now is coming out

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:10%
with this amazing music.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:10%
And in upstate New York,
Dr. Anthony Cicoria,

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:10%
PhD in physiology, an MD, and a
professor of orthopedic surgery

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:10%
at NYU, was struck in the
neck by a bolt of lightning,

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:10%
had a cardiac arrest, and
had a phenomenal near-death

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:10%
experience, but after
this, developed an interest

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:10%
in the piano and
started dreaming

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:10%
that he was playing the
same piece on the stage

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:10%
and learned how to
transcribe music

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:10%
so he could transcribe it.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:10%
And now, in addition to being
a distinguished professor

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:10%
of orthopedic surgery is also
an acclaimed concert pianist.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So these experiences do
have very powerful effects

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
on people.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They do.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely one of
the most curious topics,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the ones that
people are either afraid of,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
terrified of death, or curious
about the death experience

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.175 align:middle line:90%
before and after life.

00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
there's a whole phenomena

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of being able to recall
these lost loved ones,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to
show a little bit more

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of this video, where you're
going down the tunnel

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.517 align:middle line:84%
into this psychomanteum
experience.

00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:10%
>>CICORIA: We're here at one
of the most amazing places

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:10%
in the world--

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:10%
to me, at least.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:10%
This is the Oracle of
the Dead at Ephyra,

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:10%
where, in ancient
times, people would

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:10%
come to actually see and
visit with the spirits

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:10%
of their departed loved ones.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:10%
And now, we come through this
entranceway of enormous stones,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:10%
into a courtyard,
which is laid out

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:10%
to give the impression
that one is in a cave

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:10%
or in an underground world.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:10%
One has to imagine that, in
antiquity, this was roofed over

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:10%
so that we literally
felt as though we

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:10%
were in the underworld.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:10%
At this point,
the pilgrims would

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:10%
have been met by the [INAUDIBLE]
the guides who lived here

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:10%
to conduct the pilgrims through
the experience of visiting

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:10%
with their deceased.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:10%
A sharp right turn at
the end of the corridor

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:10%
brings one into a maze,
with narrow passageways,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:10%
sharp turns, and it's good
to remember that all of this

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:10%
was in pitch black.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:10%
And then, the visitor
came to the last turn

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:10%
of the maze, passed through
it into the apparition chamber

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:10%
proper through
these heavy doors.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:10%
And in here, the seeker
underwent the culmination

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:10%
of his journey.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:10%
In this room, there was
a big bronze caldron.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was probably highly
polished and filled with water

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:10%
to make, in effect,
a big mirror.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:10%
And there, in the
reflective surface,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:10%
initially see images,
which, in many cases,

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:10%
no doubt would then
appear to emerge

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:10%
from the reflective
surface-- come out actually

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:10%
into the physical environment--
full color, full size,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:10%
three-dimensional and, no
doubt, in many of the cases,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:10%
talking so that the seeker would
experience the living presence

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:10%
of the person who had died.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm quite convinced
from my own experiments

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:10%
in the United States that
after the seeker would leave

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:10%
this room, he was totally a
different person from then

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.460 align:middle line:10%
on for the rest of
his life, dramatically

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:10%
changed by what
happened to him in here.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So was it soon
after that experience

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
of seeing this caldron that
you created your own version

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.435 align:middle line:90%
of the psychomanteum?

00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, I found out
about it in about 1985,

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:10%
and then I did some
preliminary work.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, in 1990, I
set up a place where

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I could try it out and do it.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it like it's
a therapy or anything.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
To me, it was just
more curiosity.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But once I sort of
learned how to do it,

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I taught it to a lot
of psychotherapists.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:10%
And there are-- it's now--

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:10%
there was a handbook
of grief therapy

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:10%
I saw that has instructions
on how to do this.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:10%
In the Middle Ages, for
example, this was a common thing

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:10%
that physicians knew about.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And if they had a
patient who was grieving,

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
they could set the
patient up with a mirror

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and take them through
this experience

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
where they seemed to commune
with the person who's dead.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you the truth.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:10%
The first 10 I did were with my
students, my graduate students.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And I was kind of
holding back thinking,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:10%
I first wanted to observe
it from somebody else.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:10%
Because my inclination was to do
it immediately, but I thought,

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:10%
well, I would rather
hear it from other people

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:10%
first so that I can get some
more distant take on it.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And so after about 10 I
had done with other people,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:10%
I tried it myself.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:10%
And I was really startled
because I remember

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:10%
my students, what was
most startling to me

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:10%
was that they took it
to be a real event.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:10%
I had assumed that they would
just-- being psychologists.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They would say, oh, yes an
interest in the experience.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
But was it real?

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, all my
students said, yeah,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:10%
they took that to
be a real event.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And so I was thinking, well,
that won't happen to me.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:10%

No.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:10%
Because you know,

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:10%
the purpose of

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:10%

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to me, what I
want to know is what is.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like when
you get into the life

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
after death thing,
people say, do you

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:90%
believe or do you don't believe?

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, it shouldn't make

whether somebody believes

of the grieving experience?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the psychomanteum
is looking into the mirror

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.125 align:middle line:90%
in a dark space and really--

00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:90%

It is, it is.

And it turns out to be
an effective therapy

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.705 align:middle line:10%

of whether it is

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:10%
a direct manifestation of grief,
my thought is probably not.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:10%
The reason is that people
have been taken through this

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:10%
who had lost their loved
ones decades before,

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.782 align:middle line:10%

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I've always known that
the people were sincere.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Number two,
I've always known

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:10%
that this is what people have
always called "the afterlife."

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We have this notion
of an afterlife

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:90%
that's there in the culture.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:10%
And what my suspicion
is that notion

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:10%
comes from near-death
experiences,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:10%
the fact that people had
near-death experiences always,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:10%
that's what gave people the
idea that there's an afterlife,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:10%
see what I'm saying?

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, in a way,
this is the afterlife.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.085 align:middle line:10%
It's what people have always
called "the afterlife."

00:28:03.085 --> 00:28:03.885 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:03.885 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: But then, the next
stage beyond that is hard--

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:10%
does it go on?

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We can't get into it because
time and space breaks down,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:90%
see?

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:10%
People say that it's
not a spatial experience

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.065 align:middle line:10%
and it's not a
temporal experience.

00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So the
near-death experience

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.370 align:middle line:10%
started the conversation
of the afterlife,

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:10%
and the afterlife then
begets the conversation

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:10%
of the near-death
experience, and as it goes.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:90%

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%

you've recreated

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:10%
and literally from prehistoric
times, people discovered

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:10%
that when they gazed into
a clear pond of water,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:10%
they would see, of course,
their own reflection.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:10%
But as they gazed
longer and longer,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:10%
they would see
other things appear,

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:10%
specifically spirits, sometimes
spirits of their departed loved

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:10%
ones.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon they
realized that it

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to be a clear pond.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:10%
They could do the same
thing with a polished metal

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:10%
bowl filled with olive oil and
placed in an illuminated room

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:10%
by candlelight.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:10%
Then, later still,
they learned they

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:10%
could do the same thing by
gazing into a polished mirror.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:10%
Pretty soon, this insight
was institutionalized

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:10%
into amazing places called
"Oracles of the Dead,"

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:10%
most famously in Greece, as
described in "The Odyssey"

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:10%
by Homer.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:10%
People would take
long pilgrimages

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:10%
to these Oracles of the
Dead in the expectation

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:10%
of seeing, and visiting,
and interacting

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:10%
with their departed loved ones.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:10%
This knowledge was
all over the world,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:10%
notably in Japan, for example,
where the Oracles of the Dead

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:10%
were built over
clear ponds of water,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:10%
with high arched
bridges over the ponds.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And people would sit around
on the shore of the ponds

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:10%
reflecting, and
talking, and thinking

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:10%
about their departed loved ones.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:10%
Then, they would walk
out over these bridges

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and gaze down into the water.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And they would see the spirits
of their departed loved ones

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:10%
rise up from the water
and sometimes have

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:10%
lengthy and elaborate
conversations with them.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:10%
In the modern world, we've

I asked myself, if something

would I present myself to
Anthony Cicoria for surgery?

And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:10%
And I can give you a

So what am I to say,
you see what I mean?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:10%
There is not yet a
genuinely rational way

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:10%
of working this out.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As a
scientist, I understand

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.870 align:middle line:90%
that you would say that.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But as a believer,
what would you say?

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: No, I still say
belief is not what we think.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:10%
People think they have beliefs.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.172 align:middle line:10%
I think that's--
it's not correct.

00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
People, I don't
know what they mean

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.550 align:middle line:90%
when they call "their beliefs."

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:10%
And in my opinion, in 2018, the
question of life after death

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.730 align:middle line:10%
is not yet a scientific
question because there's

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:10%
no clearly specifiable way
to confirm or disconfirm it.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is still a
philosophical question.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And the exciting
point of that is

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that philosophy
tries to figure out

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:84%
new ways of thinking
about things.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're there now.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:10%
I think that we now have an
entirely new way of thinking

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:10%
about the question
of life after death

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:10%
that actually makes genuine,
rational progress on it

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:10%
possible.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I appreciate
this because I've

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.139 align:middle line:84%
had many people
sit in that chair,

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
saying, yes, I've
connected with this spirit.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Or, yes, that the people
who have committed suicide

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:84%
go to a deep, dark place
as if they know for sure.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And you are a scholar
of this material,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and have written
about it extensively,

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.739 align:middle line:90%
and created the term.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And I would appreciate
the fact that you say it's

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:90%
a philosophical conversation.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But my question
for you is, do you

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.774 align:middle line:90%
consider yourself an atheist?

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.470 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: An atheist?

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:39.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:34:41.715 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: If somebody
asked me, Raymond,

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:10%
do you believe that God exists?

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.080 align:middle line:10%
I say absolutely not.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And then, I go on to explain.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:10%
Because I, Raymond Moody,
am a limited human being.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Any belief that I
can form about God

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:10%
would be bound to be off base
in one direction or another.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Plus, secondly, when you
think of that sentence,

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.130 align:middle line:84%
"do you believe
that God exists,"

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.977 align:middle line:84%
the emphasis of that sentence
is on the word exist.

00:35:13.977 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, as a logician, I
could sit here and probably

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:10%
take about an hour,
but I could explain

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:10%
to you the concept of existence
and even how to symbolize it.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:10%
But when it comes
to God, I give up.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:10%
What I say is, God is bigger
than the concept of existence.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What I say is, I have a
relationship with God.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And to bring in concepts like
existence, those are concepts--

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:10%
that's a human concept.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.285 align:middle line:84%
God is something that's
outside of that framework.

00:35:51.285 --> 00:35:52.851 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, then,
what happens when you

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:10%
have a relationship with God?

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.650 align:middle line:10%
For example, in 1990, I moved
into an old gristmill that

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.620 align:middle line:10%
had last been rewired in 1950.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:10%
I knew it needed rewiring,
but I didn't have the money.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Three years and
four months passed.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:10%
In September of
1993, my wife said,

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:10%
we can get the money together
now for the rewiring,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:10%
but we didn't know
an electrician.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:10%
So we held hands
by our kitchen sink

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:10%
and prayed that God would send
us just the right electrician.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:10%
The next morning,
the phone rang.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Cheryl picked up.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The phone voice said,
hello, this is B.R. Wilson.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Cheryl said, yes,
B.R., what is it?

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, your number
just came up on my beeper.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:10%
And Cheryl said,
well, we haven't

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:10%
made a phone call this morning,
B.R., what's this all about?

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well
I'm an electrician.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we do need an electrician,
B.R., come on over.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Did his inspection, I
sat down on the porch.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Cheryl escorted
B.R. out to his van.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:10%
Short time later,
they were back up.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:10%
Cheryl, white as a sheet,
and B.R. kind of shaking.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.871 align:middle line:10%
But as she was putting
him into his van, he said,

00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be a
few days before I

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:10%
can get out here to do this.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:10%
I come from a very close
family around here.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:10%
We love each other very much.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And my 38-year-old brother
had a heart attack--

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.460 align:middle line:10%
dropped dead of a heart
attack the other day,

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:10%
and my mother had a heart
attack on the way home

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:10%
from the funeral home.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And Cheryl said,
well, B.R., my husband

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:84%
might be able to
help you with that.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:10%
He talks with people
who've been through that,

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.690 align:middle line:10%
and B.R. said, well,
my mother gave me

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:10%
this book called "Life
After Life" to read it.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And see, this is
20-something years ago

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and B.R. is still our friend.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.437 align:middle line:10%
So belief-- it's just--

00:37:41.437 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:10%
people don't know
what they're talking

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:10%
about when they say "belief."

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, as a
logician, I can say this.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I know that such and such.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.440 align:middle line:90%
I believe that such and such.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I suspect that such and such.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I assume that such and such.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess that-- why do we
pick out that one belief?

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Why do we say
something like that?

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:10%
What we're doing is, we're
passing on to our hearer

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:10%
what degree of
confidence they can

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:10%
put on what follows the
"that" based on our say so.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:10%
If we go up and we say,
I know, we guarantee.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.860 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:10%
When I say I believe
something, if it

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:10%
reports something inside of
me, does all these others, too?

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.765 align:middle line:84%
I guess, or I
suspect, or I assume.

00:38:30.765 --> 00:38:31.890 align:middle line:90%
See what I'm talking about?

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But yet your latest book
that you haven't released yet

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:90%
is about God, right?

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It's called "God
is Bigger than the Bible."

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:10%
I was sitting out on the
porch writing this book

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:10%
about 10 years ago, and this
very nice young man, Brian,

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:10%
who I had known since he was
17, he was out in our yard

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:10%
cutting the grass.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:10%
And so Brian came
up on the porch

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:10%
to get a Coke out
of the refrigerator.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, Raymond,
what are you writing?

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
writing a book called

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:90%
"God is Bigger than the Bible."

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And Brian did just like this.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:10%
He goes-- Huh.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.616 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I think his word
is even greater than he is.

00:39:22.616 --> 00:39:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, beautiful.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.135 align:middle line:90%

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:10%
But the thought
is so incoherent.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
People get to worship
the Bible, a book--

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, a story.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Whereas, God is a
little bigger than--

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:10%
I just, you know,
the latest count

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:10%
of the number of stars
in the known universe

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.030 align:middle line:10%
is something like 150
billion trillion, right?

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Let's say there's four
planets to a star,

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.720 align:middle line:10%
that the sun is very unusual.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The Kepler tells us
that they all have some.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's say four is
the average number.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
That's $600 billion
trillion planets.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:10%
According to the Kepler on the
order of 1 out of 1,000 of them

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:10%
is earth-like, that
means that there's

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:10%
on the order of a
billion trillion earths.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:10%
So the idea that God,
in all that vastness,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:10%
is going to get upset
because a couple of gay guys

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:10%
are living down the street--

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:10%
see what I mean?

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like, religion,
I'm not into religion.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.520 align:middle line:84%

Can I ask you about-- and I know
I've talked with you about this

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
before-- about suicide,
about those that have

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:90%
chosen to take their own lives.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.116 align:middle line:84%
What is your philosophical
conclusion around that?

00:40:45.116 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, I can address
this as a psychiatrist,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:10%
and also as a person who's lost
an uncle from suicide years

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:10%
ago, and also as a person
who has tried it myself.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You have?

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:10%

talked with thousands

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.480 align:middle line:10%
of people with
near-death experiences

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:10%
and probably a couple
of hundred of them

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.830 align:middle line:10%
who had near-death experiences
as a result of a suicide

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:10%
attempt.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:10%
And my opinion on the basis
of that is it doesn't work.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like, people
tell me is that you--

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:10%
number one, you
immediately regret it.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:25.730 align:middle line:10%
These are people with
near-death experiences.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's not like they
said that if they'd

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:10%
gone through to

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.860 align:middle line:10%
like they would
have been in a hell,

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:10%

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.020 align:middle line:10%

where I've come to my
thought in all this

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:10%
is that this thing we're
in, that the closest analogy

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.570 align:middle line:10%

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.150 align:middle line:10%
when you're finished this

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.517 align:middle line:10%
my best guess is you go through
some incomprehensible process,

00:42:52.517 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:10%

>>MOODY: You would?

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You're only the third person out

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'd do research.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, but
then, I say, well,

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.693 align:middle line:84%
would you choose
some tragedies, too?

00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And they say, yeah.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, when
you were watching

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:10%
that tragedy on the desert

Well, sure.

>>MOODY: Yeah, well,
I mean, I tell you,

00:44:22.276 --> 00:44:24.480 align:middle line:10%
going into the

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:10%
a pleasant experience the first

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So you do things that are
unpleasant knowing that you

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:90%

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.800 align:middle line:84%

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:90%
too, I would just go on.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.470 align:middle line:90%

00:45:26.706 --> 00:45:31.690 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, you know,
this one seems a little bit

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:10%
off the wall, but I am
not into UFOs, by the way.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.680 align:middle line:84%
My guess, as an
amateur astronomer,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.977 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there are
UFOs, and I hope I'm wrong.

00:45:41.977 --> 00:45:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But what I am talking about
is something different here.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, you
think about the--

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:84%
it seems highly
probable that there

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:53.600 align:middle line:84%
are extraterrestrial
civilizations out there.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:10%
And one thing you
get into with that

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.080 align:middle line:10%
is what is called "the
increments or ability

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:10%

is-- it was first

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.330 align:middle line:10%
stated by a guy
named Lichtenberg

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:10%
in the 18th century, who
was a German scientist

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:13.720 align:middle line:10%

out that another intelligent

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:10%
species may have different
rational principles so

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:22.180 align:middle line:10%
that there may not be
mutual intelligibility.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.105 align:middle line:90%
It's like, in the--

00:46:25.105 --> 00:46:29.080 align:middle line:84%
the day the Earth stood still
it was like the nonsense, right?

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:10%
you could think out

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I've been
reviewing toxicology, too.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:84%
In my forensic work,
I studied toxicology.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And every few years,
I come up with--

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.010 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I just go back
and review all that.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the great
homicide detectives out here

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:84%
you have is Lieutenant Kenda,
who was in Colorado Springs.

He's an eminent
homicide detective,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:10%
and he's wonderful-- a
really brilliant man.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And I was seeing one of
his shows the other night,

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.400 align:middle line:10%
and he was saying that
poisoning is very rare

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.289 align:middle line:10%

only seen three poison cases.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And personally,
it feels like you

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:32.690 align:middle line:10%
have talked about this so much
with the near-death experience

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and life after life, and
it seems to, in a way,

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.752 align:middle line:10%
be a burden to you.

00:48:38.752 --> 00:48:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: That's a very
interesting thought,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.640 align:middle line:10%
because it is.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in the sense that I
have heard thousands of people

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.370 align:middle line:10%
with near-death experiences.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.670 align:middle line:10%
I can't wait to hear
the next one, right?

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.670 align:middle line:10%
So, yes, this is
endlessly fascinating.

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there
are just so many other things

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm fascinated with.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, that there is
a much bigger context

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.590 align:middle line:84%
for thinking about these things
like near-death experiences

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that is so exciting that
actually does lead us

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to entirely new ways
of researching it.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But the problem in this whole
field was best stated by Plato.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Now this just sounds
so off the wall,

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:84%
but I can assure
everybody listening

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to this that, in the West,
rational inquiry into life

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:84%
after death has never made it
one inch past Plato and Hume.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Parapsychology, I'm sorry,
is a pseudo science.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:84%
In 2018, to say
that we could have

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:84%
scientific evidence of an
afterlife is just fallacious.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:10%
The real fact is
that the question

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.400 align:middle line:10%
of life after death in 2018 is
not yet a scientific question.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:84%
It's still a
philosophical question.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the people
who really have the situation

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.070 align:middle line:90%
correctly are Plato and Hume.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And what Plato pointed out is
there is a very big difficulty

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in this whole field when you're
trying to look at the afterlife

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:84%
rationally, which consists,
he says there's always

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.950 align:middle line:90%
got to be two things.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Number one, there's
always got to be a story.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the notion
of an afterlife

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.010 align:middle line:90%
is self-contradictory.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Life after death is a
self-contradiction, right?

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a hard concept.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
to have a story.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.660 align:middle line:10%
But then, Plato said--

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:10%
and near-death experiences would
be one of the type of stories--

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.860 align:middle line:10%
but he said, even if you had
a billion stories, that's

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.350 align:middle line:10%
not going to add up to
a proof of an afterlife

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:10%
because what you need is
some set of concepts that

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:10%
can take you from the
stories to the statement

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.840 align:middle line:10%
"there's an afterlife."

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we fallen down at.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I claim that we
can solve that now.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:09.490 align:middle line:10%
But the difficulty is
that very few people

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.130 align:middle line:10%
enjoy conceptual things.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.150 align:middle line:10%
We all love stories, right?

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But when it
gets down to concepts,

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.077 align:middle line:90%
our eyes may glaze over.

00:51:19.077 --> 00:51:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what about--
no, I mean, the studies

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.368 align:middle line:84%
that are being done with
Jim Tucker at the University

00:51:23.368 --> 00:51:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of Virginia about
the children who

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:84%
had the experiences of the
pre-existence of their life

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.690 align:middle line:90%
with wounds and birthmarks?

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.070 align:middle line:90%
There's evidence.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different bodies of work

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.464 align:middle line:90%
that are being researched there.

00:51:36.464 --> 00:51:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, listen,
I respect those people.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.180 align:middle line:10%
And I know Jim.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.120 align:middle line:10%
This is great stuff.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.080 align:middle line:10%
However, it's still the
methodological problem is--

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sorry-- it's
just, that's the fact--

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.291 align:middle line:10%
it's the real deal--

00:51:48.291 --> 00:51:49.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It's still philosophy.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:55.270 align:middle line:10%
It's not possible to make
the kind of inferences

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:58.080 align:middle line:10%
that they try to make based on--

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.440 align:middle line:10%
but this is all good news
because the real difficulty

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:10%
is that the logic that
we have doesn't work.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:90%
But now, that's solved.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:84%
We can go through a
process where, now, we

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.400 align:middle line:84%
have an entirely new way of
thinking about these things.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:10%
But see, this is the
sticking point right now--

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.980 align:middle line:10%
that most people are
not going to want

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.680 align:middle line:10%
to think through a
logical argument which

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:10%
would get them to a better place
with the stories down the line.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.827 align:middle line:10%
Because the stories
are so captivating,

00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:10%
we want to stay at the
level of the stories.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I did an entire
afterlife series.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed 24 professionals,
doctors, professors,

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.040 align:middle line:84%
experiencers-- just a minor
amount of experiencers--

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:84%
came up with these incredible
stories of life after life.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.207 align:middle line:10%
And I guess you're saying,
they're all just stories.

00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, they are
stories, and they're

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.300 align:middle line:10%
very inspiring stories.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.383 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And they're real--

00:52:52.383 --> 00:52:54.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: And they've
changed my life and so on.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:10%
And we need a better
way to think about them.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think they're
lifesaving, Raymond.

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, they are.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:02.940 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, listen,
this is not anything

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:90%
bad about near-death experience.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.060 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I can't wait
to hear the next one.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what we need
is some new set of concepts

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to think through how
to think about them

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.830 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm getting at.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.715 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what would
you suggest those are?

00:53:17.715 --> 00:53:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, basically, I've
worked out a system of new

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:84%
logical principles, where it
enables you to think about

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:84%
things that don't
make any sense--

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to think about them logically.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:90%
The nonsense.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And this has had some results.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.340 align:middle line:10%
There is one man who went
through this training years

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.550 align:middle line:10%
ago-- a scientist and artist
who is fairly well known,

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:44.670 align:middle line:10%
and then subsequently had
a near-death experience

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:10%
and, because of what he
learned in the seminar,

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.210 align:middle line:10%
made some insights about it and
could explain it in ways that

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.745 align:middle line:10%
people couldn't if they didn't--

00:53:52.745 --> 00:53:56.175 align:middle line:10%
so it's all going out in
a very positive direction.

00:53:56.175 --> 00:53:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because you have
formed an entire body of work

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.250 align:middle line:84%
for 50 years on this topic
of the near-death experience.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't you want to
make sense of it, after all?

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, and you know,
there's a paradox in this

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:84%
because nothing is more
important than the question

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.310 align:middle line:90%
of life after death, probably.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a pivotal
question, really.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything else sort
of turns around it.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: And so there's nothing
more important than that.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And so then how do you deal
with a conceptual system that

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.820 align:middle line:10%
helps you think about it, see?

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the order
of the methodology,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
the methodology
is more important.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:90%
The question is more important.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
your process, you've

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.570 align:middle line:84%
got to first go through
the method of thinking

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:53.490 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point where you
can think about the afterlife,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.290 align:middle line:90%
is my opinion.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that your
biggest reason, your biggest

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.400 align:middle line:84%
why that you have had this
whole conversation about life

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.216 align:middle line:84%
after life for the
past 50 years is what?

00:55:06.216 --> 00:55:08.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Curiosity.

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:09.150 align:middle line:10%
I just really--

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I just
want to know stuff.

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.680 align:middle line:10%
What I want to know is what is.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
near-death experiences.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:10%
It's philosophy, and
homicide, and astronomy.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I just
want to know stuff.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:10%
And I also realize that I'll
never know much of anything.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.610 align:middle line:10%
When I was seven
or eight years old,

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.860 align:middle line:10%
I looked through a telescope
for the first time,

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and I remember having that
thought that I'll never

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:38.770 align:middle line:10%
know much of anything.

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's fun trying.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:90%
