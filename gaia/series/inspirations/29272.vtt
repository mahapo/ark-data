00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:10%
Do you ever find
yourself locked

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:10%
in to totally nonproductive
styles of conversation

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:10%
with the people closest to you?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps you have
a pattern of blame

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:10%
or passive aggressive
behavior and can't

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
seem to find your way out.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
If this is the case,
you may find today's

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:10%
conversation extremely useful.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
John Kinyon has
been a facilitator

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
in the modality
called nonviolent

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
communication for 15 years.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
From couples to tribes
in Afghanistan and even

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
his own children, John
has mastered the skill

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of taking the other
person's concerns

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and needs into consideration
first before taking them on.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
John is going to be doing
a couple of live sessions

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
in the studio today
to show us how

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:90%
it works, beginning with me.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.361 align:middle line:84%
I'm a particularly bad traveler
in the eyes of the TSA people.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is because I become
confrontational with them.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you haven't--
this is not the first

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
time you've heard that.
-Right.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-And everybody has their story.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Yada, yada, yada.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:90%
And it can become very complex.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And so in a little
bit, you can maybe help

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:90%
me work through my TSA issues.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:90%
And-- but we have to want to.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really the
first tenant, isn't it?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
That we have to want
to change our behavior.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.276 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:30.849 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Yeah.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So it does take-- it does take
wanting to make that shift.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:10%
Because it's not easy.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:10%
But there is really-- what
I love about this approach

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and what I've learned
is there really is a way

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:10%
to change your inner state.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:10%
If you're angry, upset,
reactive, stressed.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
There actually is a way
to shift that inside.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:10%
So that literally-- that
whole response and pattern

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:10%
that goes off in
us can-- can change

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.195 align:middle line:10%
to something more productive.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you make the
choice to do it.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Once you make the choice.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Because something-- when
you're all ratcheted up,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
there's something in us that's
like-- it's-- we're feeding

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.439 align:middle line:90%
some kind of chemical process--

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
 --that is-- has its
own self-gratification.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
On some level.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.021 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
choose to come down.

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yep.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And disengage from that
cascade of chemicals

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that we must be getting
something out of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or we wouldn't do these things.
-Yeah.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:90%
So definitely.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Once that-- especially
once it gets going,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to pull it
back and be able to have

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
that part of our
mind that wants--

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
knows that maybe that--
reacting that way

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.411 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to get
us what we want.

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment,
it might feel

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
gratifying to be really angry
or righteous or like that.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But that-- it's sort of
accessing-- practicing

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to access that part
of us the kind of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
knows that that
isn't what's really

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
going to create what we want.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Isn't really going to
produce the world we want.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is interesting.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But when you get in those
kinds of situations or couples

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
who go head to
head in arguments,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
we don't even, at
that point, care

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
if we're getting what we want.
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.675 align:middle line:84%
We have totally
lost all perspective.

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:90%
For the most part.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what happened.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.443 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Just takes over. yeah.

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:14.235 align:middle line:84%
Where this thing, these
chemicals, start taking over.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And, well-- I
mean, we have time.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you want we
can-- before we

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
start getting into all the
explanations of how Marshall

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Rosenberg began nonviolent
communication and all, which

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:90%
we will get into.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
We want to give some
background on that so people

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
understand the history of it.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But we can go
ahead, if you want,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of get right into
how you would work with someone

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:90%
like me who has issues.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I go through-- I go
through TSA twice a week

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.386 align:middle line:84%
because I live in one state
and I work in another.

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going
through an airport

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.031 align:middle line:84%
that-- and you'll hear the
chip in my voice I'm sure.

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.643 align:middle line:84%
That I consider to be extremely
punitive in its procedures.

00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%
If you choose to opt out.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Mmhmm.
Mmhmm.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.247 align:middle line:84%
Which I don't want to go
through those machines.

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:57.041 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Mmhmm.
Mmhmm.

00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't--I mean, for
a variety of reasons.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
through those machines.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And so that's where it starts.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- I very politely
say, oh, opt out.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.501 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yep.
And then it starts.

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Now you start your
engagement with personnel.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you're just a
digit that moves through.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Your stuff moves through.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands up in
the air in the machine.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.999 align:middle line:90%
And you just go.

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You usually don't encounter
any further conversation.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you choose to opt out,
there's a lot of conversation.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So you want to work with that?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.861 align:middle line:84%
I can show you one
of our processes to--

00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah.
- --work with that.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah.
-Yeah?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, I
can work with that.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe
you can help-- help

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
me understand maybe the lack
of wisdom in my approach.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- because I'm doing
the kind of a dual purpose

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
thing in here when I start
getting a little mouthy

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
with them about
trying to re-educate

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.051 align:middle line:84%
them on the realities of 9/11.
Which--

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.789 align:middle line:90%
Isn't--

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.201 align:middle line:84%
Isn't always warmly
received, maybe.

00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's not
always warmly received.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.112 align:middle line:90%
They're not thanking you for--

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.544 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You know what?
-Yeah?

00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Two people recently
have thanked me.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Ah.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.656 align:middle line:84%
Two of the people
that have patted me

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:06.061 align:middle line:84%
down actually asked what
the name of the book

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
was I was referring--
JOHN: Ah.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to-- about, in
this case, Judy Wood's book.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
a couple of times

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot
of respect for it.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So of course-- so for me
it's feeling violated.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I feel violated.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like we should--
none of us in this line

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
should have to be
going through this.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's a-- carrying a torch.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me show you how-- one
of our processes in our Mediate

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Your Life training, this is
one that we-- if I was working

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
with you kind of as a
conflict coach or something,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I could kind of work with
you through through this.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to do--
there are three parts of it.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And as I go through those
parts, some distinctions

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and communication language I'm
going to be kind of pointing

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:90%
to as I'm working with you.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
One has to do with separating
out what you observed,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:90%
kind of what happens--

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.595 align:middle line:84%
 --from your thoughts
and beliefs and kind

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of--your interpretations.
REGINA: OK.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Your story about it.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Just to keep that separate.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.325 align:middle line:90%
And often that's hard to do.

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:90%
And another is your feelings.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk
about your feelings.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times we mix up
our feelings with our thoughts.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll be asking you
to kind of separate that out

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and how I reflect back
what I'm hearing you say

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:90%
and questions to ask.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally, to get to
what your needs are.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.441 align:middle line:84%
This language for the qualities
we all want as human beings.

00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.051 align:middle line:84%
That we all want respect
or love or consideration.

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Those things.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But we often mix
that up with-- we

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
call the strategies,
the specific things

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that we want to meet our needs.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Often that's all
mixed together.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be sort of piecing
that, kind of separating that

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
out as well as we're talking.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK.
-OK?

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And we won't do an hour
session, obviously.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: No.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.736 align:middle line:90%
We'll just do a little quick.

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, just-- get through it
in, you know, five, ten minutes.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
However long it takes for
me to get something through.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.989 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with this--
with the first part.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Which is what you experience
inside of yourself.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So you've said you
start to go through.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.637 align:middle line:84%
You say you want to
go through-- you don't

00:06:56.637 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
want to go through
the machine, you want

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:90%
to go through the pat down.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And you-- then you
said that there

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
was a certain way that they
treat you that you don't like.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So some things that
you've perceived.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So say a few more
words about what-- what

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:90%
happens that you don't like.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I first go through
my own self-dialogue.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:90%
When I show up, I think.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Make this a happy day.
Right?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll talk to myself
about, let's just--let's just

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:90%
sail through here.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It's probably going to be a
nice lady on the other side.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Try to keep yourself.
Yeah.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Keep it positive.
Yeah.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Keep it positive.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And you'll attract something,
you know, a little more

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%
reasonable on the other end.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I always start out
in a positive frame of mind.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I stand aside and wait
my turn to be called and taken

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
through for the pat down.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And if the person
is also cheerful,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%
there's usually never any issue.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.646 align:middle line:84%
And I may still bring up, you
know, my thoughts and views.

00:07:56.646 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds ridiculous.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.811 align:middle line:84%
My thoughts and
views about 9/11.

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Like some crusader.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is not a wise thing
to do if you're doing

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:90%
it as often as I'm doing it.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But I may still find a way
to slip something in there.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So what do they do?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's just even
one thing that somebody

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
has done that you-- as
you're going through

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%
that-- you really don't like.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
What-- one thing
that happens that--

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.225 align:middle line:84%
Usually they'll start
with a terse attitude.

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: A terse attitude.
OK.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Very-- very-- where's
your stuff, ma'am?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it's always a choice
how you treat someone.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's the tone of
voice that that's--

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Tone of voice.
-Just like of few words.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.479 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And then they come over.
And then some of--

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:32.985 align:middle line:84%
And the body language
that goes with that.

00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
-OK.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.786 align:middle line:84%
So there's that--that
kind of way-- that level.

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's the
starting level.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the starting level.
Now some of your--

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Now what are some
of your thoughts?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps to get
that out there kind of.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Just what do you-- what are
you telling yourself about?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
That they're-- they're--

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.875 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: They're being mean.

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
They're rude.
They're being mean.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They're-- yeah.
So like that.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Say if you--

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.414 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like they're
being unnecessarily harsh

00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
or mean when they
don't have to be.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Unnecessarily--

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:90%
They could choose to be nice.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Unnecessarily
harsh and mean

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
when they don't have to be.
-Yeah.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.255 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example
of something you're

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
saying to yourself about it.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
There's the kind
of, what happens?

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
The body language,
the tone of voice.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.339 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
thinking that they're

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%
being mean unreasonably.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.187 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to be this way.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:09:10.187 --> 00:09:11.211 align:middle line:84%
And things like that.
Right?

00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So just seeing that,
just kind of seeing,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.671 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's-- that's some
thoughts going through you.

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.075 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the what happened.

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you said
you feel that way.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get a little
more into the feelings that are

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:90%
about what goes on inside you.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
So using words that go that way.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:90%
So are you feeling angry?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll feel angry.
JOHN: Angry.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.771 align:middle line:84%
And kind of confrontational
that someone's being rude to me

00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
unnecessarily.
JOHN: Ah.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.039 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I view it as
a choice on their end

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
rather than the way
things are, so to speak.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll view it as a--
JOHN: Yeah.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.061 align:middle line:84%
As a conscious
choice to not be nice.

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
OK.
So that's-- perfect.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.461 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So then
that ticks me off.

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
thought that they're

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.624 align:middle line:84%
making a conscious
choice not to be nice.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to be this way
and they're-- they're trying

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to be mean just for
whatever-- just to be mean.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's like, again, the
thought you're having about

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:90%
it and the feeling is anger.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Angry, ticked off.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get
in touch with it

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
even in this moment
just a little

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
bit to just-- to let
yourself feel that.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Just to feel in--
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The experience in your
body of it versus sort

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
of being in your head of
the images and thoughts

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:90%
about them being mean.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And they have a choice.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But to just be with what's
going on in your body with it.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
really helps kind of unhook

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.845 align:middle line:84%
from the reaction and
help give you more choice.

00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can feel my--everything
starts boiling a bit.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: You feel boil--
so how about just

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
be with that boiling?
-Yeah.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to get
away from that, right?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We want to like
get me out of this

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
experience of boiling and--
REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel--
- --discomfort.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
 --a heightened--
elevated heart beat.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: OK.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.893 align:middle line:84%
I'll feel just kind of the
pressure in my system going up.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yep.
Yep.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:90%
To be in this situation.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because then I start
feeling kind of indignant.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And then depending on what
happens after that--and then

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I have to calm myself down.
Yeah.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that should
stay with you.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Just those feelings right now.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
If you get in touch
with any of them.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.769 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Or even in that moment
if you're in the line.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:00.291 align:middle line:84%
But to actually just be present
with those experiences--

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And to me what
being present means,

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
it's like in the
present moment allowing

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.471 align:middle line:84%
myself to kind of-- to witness
what's going on and to feel it.

00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to
normally get away from it.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But to feel the anger, the
pressure, the tingling all

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
that stuff you said.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.635 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
To not run away from it, but
to not act out on it either.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
To just--or run with
it and indulge it,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
but just kind of be with it.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.636 align:middle line:84%
So just do that for a second.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of feel it in you.
You got that?

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
Yeah.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Feeling it?
OK.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that-- now to go
to your needs, which

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is a core part of the process
of nonviolent communication,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and in our training of
how do you mediate things

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
within you and with others
in your life to these ideas--

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:90%
this needs.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So what needs do you think
are not met to you-- for you?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.136 align:middle line:90%
Human needs.

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.851 align:middle line:84%
Anybody on the planet
might want at this level.

00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
At that level, because I have
already charged belief systems

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
about the whole fact
this even exists,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that's inciting me
before I even get going.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.436 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm layering
that with, you know,

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:84%
a personality thing that
I'm projecting-- I'm

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
assuming or projecting on them.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing,
as you're saying

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that, that the need is simply
to be treated respectfully.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.029 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Treated with respect.
-And fairly.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: And fairly.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Fairly and respectfully.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And fairly-- fairness is also--
REGINA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Like means with a
certain level of--

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.701 align:middle line:84%
Because fairness sometimes
can be-- oh, it's unfair.

00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.831 align:middle line:84%
So does fairness mean for you
like being treated with care?

00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
With consideration?
REGINA: Respect.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Basic human respect.
-Respect.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Kind of basic human respect.
-Yeah.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm not trying
to make you--

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
-Ruin your day.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.844 align:middle line:84%
Please don't try to ruin mine.
Kind of basic--

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
With a certain level of like
you-- there's a mattering,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a care,
there's a respect.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And wanting people
to treat each other

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
with that basic
level of respect.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So how is it for you
in this moment just

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
to be with that,
of wanting that?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Even separate-- I mean,
beyond this situation.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Just like how much you
would like for yourself,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
for others, for people to treat
each other with respect, care?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first feeling that
comes up is it makes me sad.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.787 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Sad.
-That people--

00:13:02.787 --> 00:13:03.601 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:06.471 align:middle line:84%
 --feel it's OK to
do that to each other.

00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:08.721 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
So sad-- now more sadness?

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
I think so.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Sadness.
Sadness.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.089 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't like-- and I
don't like watching it

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
when it's happening
with other people.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't like-- I don't
like the whole scene.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't like
watching old people

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.501 align:middle line:84%
have to get up out of their
wheelchairs to be patted down.

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
-I don't like any of it.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It makes me sad that we've
gotten to this place.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So which is a different
experience then that anger,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
ticked off, reacting that way.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel a little
different when you're touched

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
with those or your needs--
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
It makes sad.
-And you're feeling sad.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It makes me
feel a little teary.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that's a shift.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
That's a very different place to
be in that I believe you'd have

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
more options right now to
respond in a way that would

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
better meet your needs
for respect and care

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and those kind of things,
that you could take action

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would
meet those needs

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and more likely create that
with these other people.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.455 align:middle line:84%
But there is another step in
this-- there are two steps.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK.
-Can we do that real quick?

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Because often we might just--
we could just stop there.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Another word was popping up.
Powerlessness.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Ah.
OK.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.476 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one.
Powerlessness.

00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Powerlessness.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, so if that's--

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
They can kick me
off the flight.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
They can make sure I don't
get-- make my flight.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.211 align:middle line:84%
They have the power to do that.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:90%
If I don't obey.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.255 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not a good
person in their mind.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Uh huh.
Right.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.279 align:middle line:84%
So maybe some more thoughts--
REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
 --like, if I don't obey, I
need to be good or obedient,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
but--
REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Obedient.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:23.705 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:25.641 align:middle line:84%
And some images there.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Around people making me be
this way or something, right?

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Feeling powerlessness.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
The feelings.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And then to the need, getting
back down to the need again.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So the need for
power, for choice,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.901 align:middle line:84%
for-- what do you think-- what's
the best word that-- is it

00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:90%
power?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Is that the need for
you that isn't met

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
that you would like to be met?

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
A sense of power?

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:90%
A sense of my own autonomy.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.721 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Autonomy.
-Yeah.

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Autonomy.
-Yeah.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.559 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: OK.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.545 align:middle line:84%
That I'm my own
sovereign being.

00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Sovereign being.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to be violated,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.261 align:middle line:84%
nor do I want to
violate the other one.

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.255 align:middle line:84%
I don't want
violations occurring.

00:14:57.255 --> 00:14:59.041 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:14:59.041 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
So autonomy.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
buzz around autonomy.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Big buzz around autonomous.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And how is it for you, just
again to sort of check in,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
when you go from the
thoughts down to the feelings

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and then getting to what is
the need behind all that?

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Because that's often
we don't get to.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
What is it behind all that?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
How is to just be--
yeah, I really--

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:90%
so important for me and others.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody we have autonomy,
as well as respect and care.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.631 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
-Yeah.

00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:23.245 align:middle line:84%
How is that?
-That feels very clear.

00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a very clear feeling.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Like a kind
of a grounding--

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:90%
It's very grounding.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.641 align:middle line:84%
That this is someone
that everyone deserves.

00:15:29.641 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah, yeah.
-You know?

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.144 align:middle line:84%
To have their own
sovereignty as a human.

00:15:32.144 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: And that's what you--
you want that for everybody.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
For you and everybody.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
To own their own sovereignty
and autonomy for their choosing

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
how they want to
be in the world.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Mmhmm.
Including them.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had some
really nice ladies too

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.507 align:middle line:84%
and they're very clear with me.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:90%
They hate their jobs.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them hate their jobs.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're single mothers.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:90%
They need the paycheck.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
They've been through
some rough stuff.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.919 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to
go automatically

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.139 align:middle line:84%
to this next step.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:56.969 align:middle line:84%
Which is empathy for the other.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:56.969 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of mediating
our experience, for me

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- there's
always at least two.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
There's the kind of
the self and the other.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And if I can put
myself into this role

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of holding as the mediator
perspective on any situation.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So we've given you
some understanding

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.621 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on in you,
try to get underneath that.

00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
-Which can be very calming.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like that had
some effect just going, yeah.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Settling, right?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:90%
But then to go to the other.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.967 align:middle line:90%
Trying to understand the other.

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're already
starting to go there.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of that terse voice,
the treating you in this way

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that you were talking
about, what do

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
you think might be their world?

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:90%
What's going on for them?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:84%
If you tried to step
into their world

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:84%
for a minute of
why they'd be doing

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and what they're thinking,
feeling, wanting?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you think's
going on there?

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Say more about that.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that I feel
that sometimes they're

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
just having a bad--
I imagine they're

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
probably having a bad day.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- I've learned over
time they're being watched.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
They're on camera.
And they have a lot of--

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.131 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: So maybe they're
scared about being watched.

00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:90%
They're scared.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had one situation
where the woman

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
was being very, very invasive.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these pat downs
go against TSA regulations.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.501 align:middle line:84%
They really touch
your private parts.

00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not nice.
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And others, they'll choose to
go through all of your things

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
and literally do a powdering
of every item in your suitcase.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:90%
I know the TSA regulations.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.333 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that was a choice
to do it for some reason.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And one woman
that was very heavy

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:90%
handed about the whole thing.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why are you
choosing to do this?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to make
either of us this miserable.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said three
times in almost

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
like I'm trying to give you
information here with my eyes

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
that she said, I need this job.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I got she really
couldn't afford to lose her job

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.201 align:middle line:84%
and she had someone
watching her.

00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so she was trying
to impress someone

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
while she was training
another person

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that had just come on board.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I mean while I was
ratcheted up, I thought, OK.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Back off.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Quit asking her questions.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:90%
She's afraid of losing her job.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I'm just thankful
I'm not in her position

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to have that job.
-Mmhmm.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.491 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I wouldn't
want that job, so--

00:18:04.491 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
REGINA: And it did.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So thinking about this person--
REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.301 align:middle line:84%
That maybe she was a
bit scared underneath.

00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And concern for her own
security and well being that

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
would come by having the job.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that maybe that-- even
though you don't like the way

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.471 align:middle line:84%
she was meeting
her needs, right?

00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other
people you're thinking of.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But that if we can connect to
the human need behind it, then

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that can sort of soften
and create a sense

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.559 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and connection?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So how is it for
you to get into maybe

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that is me trying to meet
this need for well being?

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that
actually-- at the end

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
of that particular
encounter, which

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:84%
was one of the rough ones,
I basically said, look.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Anything I said here by way
of pushing back against you

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.420 align:middle line:90%
is not personal.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I understand you need your job.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just so
frustrating I sometimes

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
just-- I can't help it.
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't help myself just
saying something back.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I feel really violated.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:90%
And I told her that.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.271 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know it's
not your fault. Yeah.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So going to the third part is
what you might do differently.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
What you're learning
is from that.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
What new possibilities
arise from being

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
in touch with your
needs for respect,

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:90%
autonomy, those kind of needs.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
The other person's
needs may be for well

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.635 align:middle line:90%
being and wanting security.

00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Well, what can I do?

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would I
do in that situation?

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Now that I know, really
I want just autonomy

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.395 align:middle line:90%
and basic human respect.

00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yes.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need to
reeducate them about 9/11.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.321 align:middle line:84%
I need to just maybe
skip that part.

00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So what could you do that
would meet your needs

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
for that and maybe somehow
taking into account their needs

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for their own well
being and security

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and trying to do their good job.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Maybe the
best thing would be--

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.083 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's also
maybe about contribution?

00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Wanting to like contribute
and feel good about how

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
they're contributing to safety?

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one lady said she
was in a military family,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
raised that way.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was security.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So one thought
might be that just

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
struck me is maybe
I need to just ask

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
them how their day is going.
JOHN: OK.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Right off the bat,
how's your day going?

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: How's your day going?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And just go in--
maybe go into resonance

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.291 align:middle line:84%
a little sooner than apologizing
for my part of it later.

00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Uh huh.
-Would that be a way to do it?

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's an-- I mean, you
might have more ideas too.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.481 align:middle line:84%
But that sounds like it just--
the idea popped into your head,

00:20:22.481 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
right?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
A new idea.
And that's what I find.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
When we do this
empathy for ourselves

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and try to do empathy for the
other person imagining what

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
might be going on for them
at the more human level

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
through their feelings
and their needs,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
then often these ideas just
pop in, these new possibilities

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:90%
for taking action.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
stopping it right there.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
If we-- so we have time
to talk about someone.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You can send me a
bill, by the way.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.251 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.251 --> 00:20:50.717 align:middle line:84%
If we go on this long.
But, no.

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that makes sense.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I can see what I really want and
I feel very hurt that humanity

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.525 align:middle line:90%
is being violated.

00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: There's a sadness there.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:90%
A sadness.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the-- and
the being violated,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
the effort is to shift the
thought of being violated

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to seeing these
behaviors you don't like

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and then connecting to
the need for respect,

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
autonomy, consideration.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Kind of basic treatment--

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And give it out first.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Give it to the
other person first.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And just set a different
pattern and rapport.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.989 align:middle line:90%
I'll try that when I got home.

00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:20.855 align:middle line:90%
That's something you can--

00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:22.736 align:middle line:90%
DIA is the most harsh airport.

00:21:22.736 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll send them a bill too.
Yeah.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.389 align:middle line:84%
Send them a bill too.
Yeah.

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll be flying out
tomorrow, and so I'll

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:90%
let you know how that goes.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:90%
But no, I could feel it.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to get teared
up and I was starting to feel

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:90%
what was really underneath it.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And so this is wonderful.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's an example.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a
lot of people feel

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
they're losing their
autonomy in a lot of ways.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
The presence of CHP, the
presence of-- just the presence

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
of authoritative
figures in our lives

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
pressing down on us when we're
already under a lot of stress

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.066 align:middle line:90%
right now as a civilization.

00:21:52.066 --> 00:21:52.770 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.478 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
pressure filled times.

00:21:54.478 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were talking
off camera about this.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
When it starts ratcheting up--
and this is in everybody--

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:90%
well, not everyone.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But most people are
feeling the stress.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
They may try to dissipate
it through meditation

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and manage it.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But we're almost feeling this
boiling frog syndrome going

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:90%
on where the pressure is on.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Mmhmm.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And so your overview
first for every one of us

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to do,
I mean using the example

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
we just used as well.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to catch how we're
feeling instantly, right?

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Catch it early.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.076 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Catch it early.

00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And to me it's a practice.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So if I can-- I try to have
a daily-- in our training

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:90%
we all invite people.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Have a daily practice of
presence and self-connection

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:90%
to notice when we get triggered.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't
notice for a while

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and we get all ratcheted
up and it's really

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:90%
hard to do anything about it.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.207 align:middle line:84%
So to notice it
earlier and earlier.

00:22:47.207 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You can feel
it in your body.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the practice of paying
attention to your body.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we
kind of live up here.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But to pay more-- to have
a daily practice of being

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
focused in the body a
little more, being aware of

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
am I noticing?

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting triggered?

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then something that I
learned as far back as when

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in college and deeply
enamored with Mahatma Gandhi

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and the practice of
nonviolence as a way to respond

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to oppressive forces in the
world and conflict-- basically

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:90%
conflict.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
That was your way
into all of this.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%
That was my way in.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
That I just was so taken with
what this man had come up with

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and the power.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I saw amazing power
on this huge level.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
toppled in India

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the power of the British
Empire at that time.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what were you
taking away from that?

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.056 align:middle line:90%
So what I took-- yeah.

00:23:39.056 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:84%
What I took away from
that is-- and it's

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
been years of really
unpacking and what-- you know,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:90%
what did I learn from that?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I would say now is that
the incredible power of being

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
willing to be present
to and face and confront

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of just meet
and be with those deepest

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
fears and that rage and anger,
whatever boils up in us.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we want you to run
away from that inside or we

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
want to lash out and blame
others and take-- but if I can

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
just-- if I can-- and I
saw that Gandhi do that.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That was the principle
of nonviolence.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
That he was willing
to suffer, to die.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Totally committed.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And he inspired everyone else.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:90%
That that was freedom.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That was power.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
If you could sit with
your own deepest fears

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and stay present
and not-- and then

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
you could be present to
whatever fears are trying to be

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:90%
stimulated from the outside.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But if we can be present to that
fight, flight, freeze in us.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
That-- it's such a deep
biological reaction.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we're being honest--and
if we're being honest,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
everybody can feel
the second it starts.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.121 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: In everybody.
You know it.

00:24:46.121 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We might call it
different things.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:90%
But it-- it's-- yeah.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful experience.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So the commitment is to
be willing to acknowledge

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
it and do something about it.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Instead of what we talked
about in the very beginning,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:84%
having these chemicals basically
take you on their own journey

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.486 align:middle line:84%
into a very screwball
emotional journey.

00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yes.
Yeah.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.439 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:08.757 align:middle line:84%
So being willing
to be with it first.

00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
To me I've found
more and more how

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:90%
important that first step is.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:90%
To notice.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And be with it in a way
that I'm not just letting--

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not reacting to it.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I'm not--
I'm just being with it.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything else.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to blame
for the other anymore.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to let go of
all my thoughts and stuff.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And can just feel
it and be with it?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And then can I go into empathy?

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:90%
If I'm willing?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And you have to be willing.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.613 align:middle line:90%
You have to be really willing.

00:25:33.613 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
If you have a real
bone with somebody

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.335 align:middle line:90%
it's harder for people.

00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: It's harder, but that's
why we start with-- notice

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
how I started with you.
-Yeah.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When we did the
situation with you,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.394 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask you
to go right away,

00:25:42.394 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
the other person?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Because, right?

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We need-- usually we
need the empathy first.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to get
underneath our reactions

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and all that to get into, what
are those needs underneath?

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.361 align:middle line:84%
Those-- that tender place of
what we really care about.

00:25:57.361 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you got
there, you said

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:84%
you started to feel moved and
touched and kind of what I saw

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
is like you got
tuned into a bigger

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
picture of what you care about.
REGINA: Right.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And you got to
sadness and mourning.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But I sensed also that
inspiration of, yeah.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
for this world

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and for myself and others.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we give ourselves
that, if we can do that,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.314 align:middle line:84%
then I think we can
really be willing to be

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:24.079 align:middle line:84%
present to another's experience.
-Yeah.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Because that defused the
chemical cascade enough

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that it's like, oh, I
see what's going on.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.271 align:middle line:84%
I'm really sad about what's
happened around here.

00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
Right.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
that's starting

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.185 align:middle line:90%
from a completely different--

00:26:34.185 --> 00:26:35.051 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: It's very different.

00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:90%
 --kind of motivation, even.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And you've dealt with this
even in tribal situations

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan, had some
really interesting experiences.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yes.

over Skype

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%

other's hair out if they

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:90%
could have gotten together.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
all that when we come back.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a short break.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

We're back.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
that, by the way.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:90%
That was very helpful.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you got something
out of it in your own way

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
problems with something else.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
something that is almost

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:90%
an epidemic in this country.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, Italy and some
other countries too.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's road rage.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And before we get into your
experience in Afghanistan

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and also mediating between
couples and some things

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%

you-- so we have

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot to do in this half hour.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
We have one other case
that I find absolute--

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.062 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.062 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:90%
--absolutely hysterical.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Christie is sitting here and
she's thinking, oh, really?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this?

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Christie lived in Los Angeles.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And she had a problem
with the rude behavior

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of the other driver.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And so Christie, if
you would like to help

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:90%
share how you dealt with this.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's-- you had a unique
way of dealing with it.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a kind of
a giant megaphone

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.261 align:middle line:84%
like you would see in the
1920 cheerleader type--

00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
--megaphone with the
handle on the bottom.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would just point it out
the window and let her rip.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Expletives deleted often times.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes it would
just be as simple

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
as I might point it
out the window and go,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
we do not give
rides to strangers.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, so it
was very satisfying.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:84%
See, she was
having a satisfying

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.621 align:middle line:84%
outcome from this, right?
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.953 align:middle line:84%
So there-- I mean, there's
not as much incentive

00:28:39.953 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to change if you feel
satisfied with your behavior.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But was there anything
you weren't-- I mean,

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.241 align:middle line:84%
were you feeling that
rage response in you.

00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't--
-I definitely was.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So that-- there was some
satisfaction in being

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
able to express something, to do
something that would let people

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.011 align:middle line:84%
know that you weren't happy
with what they were doing.

00:28:57.011 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
a high cost to pay,

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
maybe, of just how much you
were in turmoil inside of you.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Very definitely.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in my
20s at the time.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.279 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite a long time ago.
-Yeah.

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure the road
rage idea was out there

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:90%
the way we think of it today.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just
coming into being,

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.375 align:middle line:84%
which is why I had to eventually
get rid of my megaphone.

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But you still have issues
when people cut you off.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the whole
problem went away.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
No.
It definitely doesn't.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But I have thought-- I have
quite a commute here every day.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:90%
About an hour on the freeways.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the
car as my classroom.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
To get in there and
recognize when I'm doing it.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And have different
things that I can do.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So do you pay
attention then to your--

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I totally do.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And you start to have that
reaction go off in you?

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I totally do.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.636 align:middle line:84%
And then is there practice you
have around kind of how you--

00:29:55.636 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
- --are present being with that.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
How you're--
-I might think about skipping.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can't think about
skipping or skip-- you know,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:84%
like little kids do.
-Uh huh.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:90%

image that you bring

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
OK.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I think road rage is
a terrific way to work

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.675 align:middle line:90%
on your spiritual development.

00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:90%
I do too, actually.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has that kind
of strong reaction to it,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:90%
can I stay with it?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.585 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:30:26.585 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then make a conscious
choice to do something else?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Something in terms
of the work that I do

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and how to mediate that
experience within yourself

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm imagining
maybe with the other,

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but that to get to what--
because sometimes we don't

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.280 align:middle line:84%
consciously-- we implicitly
it might be-- but we don't

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
consciously get there,
is what needs that anger

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and that it comes up in you
to name, what is it that's

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
important to you
that's not being

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.781 align:middle line:90%
met by what you see going on?

00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's
the obvious things.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You somehow-- someone has
done something against you,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess would be the most
obvious way to look at it.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you said that.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.046 align:middle line:84%
Because that, I would say-- call
that a thought that we have.

00:31:13.046 --> 00:31:13.745 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:13.745 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They've done
something against me.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I think we're talking about
power here because we're

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:90%
in large metal machines.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Uh huh.
OK.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So the thought they're
doing something against me.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They have-- there's something
about something power.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's they
need then, to have power.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And a perception that maybe
there's a threat to power

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.409 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, so--
-Mmhmm.

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:40.145 align:middle line:84%

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and being disrespectful
or rude or something.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But to get to, oh, that's
what I really want.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's far more-- I
detect far more subtle shifts

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in how I'm feeling that
the other driver is

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:90%
reacting against me.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it may be
something as subtle

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
as they're driving too close.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm perceiving that
they're tailgating me.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Uh huh.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So you perceive that.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And then is that also
then--is it about safety?

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.561 align:middle line:84%
Or is it about--
-Yes.

00:33:01.561 --> 00:33:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
So--

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.871 align:middle line:84%
Definitely because
I'm on the freeway.

00:33:03.871 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Getting close.
Yeah.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
That it's potentially
a dangerous situation

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
if someone's driving
in that kind of way.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a very-- you
know, but people

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
consider our highways
as a real classroom

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:90%
for the spiritual path.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.720 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we're all
connected on that freeway.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an artery traveling.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody does something
that causes an accident,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.763 align:middle line:90%
it's affecting all of us.

00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:90%
So I consider that as well.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And for me part of the practice,
the spiritual practice,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
is can I name-- can I get
connected to what is it when

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm having this reaction?

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I like
your idea of going

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to some positive image that
shifts me out of that, right?

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's a-- that's
certainly one action to take.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think from
my experience it

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
can be very powerful
to get to what is

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of that reaction.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then what could I do to
shift my experience of it.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes just being
able to get to what it is.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Those needs.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Safety.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
Power even.
Yeah.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Safety, power, consideration.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.389 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it might be.
-Mmhmm.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And to me that's the practice.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Because then in any situation,
right, we get triggered.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.148 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's on the road or--
-Right.

00:34:30.148 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:90%
In any kind of situation.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And for me, if I can get more
and more fluency at getting to,

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
oh, what is it that's going
on in me that I'm wanting

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:90%
at that kind of human level?

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:84%
And then oft-- sometimes,
like what Regina was saying,

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that these-- or found that
this new idea, this kind

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:90%
of new possibilities come.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.889 align:middle line:84%
To what request could I make
of myself or what could I do?

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:84%
What action could I take that
actually meets those needs?

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So to have kind of new
insights about that.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And something we didn't do
that I did with Regina--

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.886 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think we
have time right now.

00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But-- and if you wanted
it-- to, oh, what

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:90%
could be going on for them?

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's the empathy--
-Mmhmm.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.454 align:middle line:84%
There's the empathy
for ourselves, right?

00:35:10.454 --> 00:35:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And trying to get to the bottom.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:90%
But then there's also, wow.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.930 align:middle line:84%
What could be-- because this
stepping into the reality

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:90%
of another person.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so hard for us
as human beings when we get

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:90%
triggered--

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
-- --to want to go
over there and, what?

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
How could they be
seeing the world?

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
How could reality be
showing up for them?

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And we can pretty much guess.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.236 align:middle line:90%
And what their needs are.

00:35:28.236 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We're so stressed out
and upset, of course,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood is they're
going through a very similar

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:90%
experience in their own way.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Then maybe
they're very stressed.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-And trying to-- yeah.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Which is true of all of us.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.021 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it does feel like a
bit of a tinderbox right now.

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So when he was asking you
that question, Christie,

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.080 align:middle line:84%
did something pop into your
mind about what you could

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
do to somehow preempt
those feelings

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.360 align:middle line:90%
or the reactions in the future?

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Anything you haven't done yet
that you got a new insight.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:90%
It's always a process.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm always working on it.
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.506 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel like I'm
making tremendous progress.

00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're almost a
reformed road rager.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm say-- I would
say I'm in recovery.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You're in recovery.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Christie, I really
appreciate your

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:90%
coming and sharing your story.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.633 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one of the
goofiest ones I've heard.

00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like that strategy.
It's got a lot of--

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.030 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.861 align:middle line:84%
Yours my favorite
right alongside--

00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Creativity.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.710 align:middle line:84%
 --the fellow in
Arizona who wore

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:84%
the gorilla costume to beat
the cameras on the freeway.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You're right there with him.
Creative.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:84%
CHRISTIE: Well,
thank you very much.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:90%
You're so welcome.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for doing this for us.
-Very nice to meet you.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to meet you too.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for staying
late for work today.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate it.
-Very happy to do it.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think your wireless
so you can get up if you

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:90%
feel comfortable doing so.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:90%
CHRISTIE: Thank you.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
OK.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to find out--
JOHN: Yeah.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to go
past road rage to rage

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.611 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking war zones.
-War zone rage.

00:36:45.611 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We're talking-- now
how-- just briefly, how

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:90%
did you end up in Afghanistan?

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I know Marshall.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Who was the one that really
created this--the whole system

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of nonviolent communication?
JOHN: Yes.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.650 align:middle line:90%
The protocols for it?

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:90%
That you've been seeing here.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yes.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Marshall was supposed to go.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Marshall was supposed to go.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So this was early 2002 right
after the-- 9/11 had happened

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and the bombings in Afghanistan.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And Marshall Rosenberg,
who is my long time mentor

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:84%
for over 15 years now, he had
decided to go into the-- he'd

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
been invited by
somebody in Pakistan

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to go and work in the refugee
camps along the border.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's this--
just at that point

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
especially, just
tons-- so millions

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:90%
of people on the border there.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Afghani refugees.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to
go into the camps.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And my colleague Ike Lasater
and I. We said, hey, Marshall,

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.900 align:middle line:90%
can we go with you?

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It sounded adventurous,
exciting and all that.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, sure.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And your intention
was you were going

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.447 align:middle line:84%
to create a nonviolent,
peaceful communication

00:37:49.447 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:90%
between warring factions.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.110 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah, we were
going to do a training.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were going
to do training.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.319 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:53.319 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:84%
We were going to offer
these skills and approaches

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to going working on conflict.
REGINA: OK.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So Marshall-- it
was too dangerous.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Marshall decided, this
is way too dangerous.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The State Department had
been putting out notices.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Do not go to Pakistan.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
By all means, do not go
to the northwest frontier

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:90%
province area of Pakistan.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly where we
had-- were intending to go.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:90%
So Marshall said, no way.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.321 align:middle line:84%
And for some crazy reason
Ike and I decided to go.

00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Hey, your bags
were packed, right?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:90%
He had already gone ahead.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just--you know,
Marshall I'm gonna--

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and he was like, do not.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.969 align:middle line:84%
Don't go.
Don't go.

00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And I-- I don't know.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I just feel so compelled.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:90%
So I-- we went.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And we had a quite a
harrowing adventure

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:84%
of trying to do this
without him being there

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and making our way from
Karachi in the south

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.070 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
Islamabad and then up

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:84%
into the Northwest
frontier province.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.421 align:middle line:84%
And we got into the camps and
we were there for three days

00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
total.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And we had this naive
idea we'd just kind

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.895 align:middle line:90%
of walk in and do a workshop.

00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
And--

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.151 align:middle line:84%
Was there something as like a
language barrier, for example?

00:38:58.151 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Had you considered some
of those smaller nuances?

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We had translator.
Well, we had a translator.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But English was not--
-No, that's not the--

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
- --his strong suit.
-Yeah.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And he knew nothing about
nonviolent communication.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And-- but we gave
him a crash course.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And we got up into the-- found
a way to get into the camps.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And it took a couple days of
just listening to their pain.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.395 align:middle line:90%
They just-- they didn't--

00:39:23.395 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: One can only imagine.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They just-- so much pain
related to the US, the Soviets.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Just all that has been happening
their country for so long.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So we did a lot of
listening for a while.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we could see-- and we
threw all these-- there

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.824 align:middle line:84%
were about maybe eight
different languages

00:39:36.824 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:90%
that were being spoken.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And the different elders
that showed up each day

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to meet with us, there were like
maybe 30 to 40 or maybe even

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:90%
more each day.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
listening to them, even

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:84%
through this translation
that was often very complex

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how accurate,
that you could see that we'd

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:90%
make an empathy guess.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We'd just say, you're
feeling this way

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:84%
because you have these needs
and they're not being met

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.205 align:middle line:84%
and you're in so
much pain about it.

00:40:00.205 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And they'd sit back at
times, and then their eyes

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.850 align:middle line:90%
would kind of glisten, moisten.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Like they got really heard.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
-You know?

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.631 align:middle line:84%
And they saw us as
representing the US and West.

00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the third day,
they had been very hospitable

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and they asked us
to go to the mosque,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:84%
if we'd go to the
mosque with them.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And immediately half the room--
it's, again, about 40 elders.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Say, no.
That's not right.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.264 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:40:26.264 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And they started to
fight right in the room.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.884 align:middle line:84%
They just, you know--this
energy level shot up.

00:40:29.884 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yelling at
each other and--

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And yelling and just--
zsh zsh zsh, you know?

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And I calmed and
I turned to Ike

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Ike, we
finally have our conflict.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.251 align:middle line:84%
Because we couldn't really get
a good situation to work on.

00:40:38.251 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We've got a conflict to show
them how we can do this.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
like, are you crazy?

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.819 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:40:43.819 --> 00:40:45.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a religious
conflict here.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was too excited
to get-- notice.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And we got everybody
calmed down.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
bringing up one person

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
from each side of
that conflict and I

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:84%
spent the day mediating between
them in our-- with our process.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I got that the
needs from one side

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:84%
would say-- say the
side-- the person

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.330 align:middle line:84%
representing the side
that wanted us to come.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
You could--you maybe could
imagine the needs that he was

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:90%
trying to meet by asking us.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Hospitality.
Connection.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.491 align:middle line:84%
Being able to have a sense
of inclusion and community.

00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:23.190 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, those kind
of needs that he was trying

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to meet and the others that
were supportive of that

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to want us to come.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
side, got to get him

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:90%
clear on what he was wanting.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Not just what he
thought what was

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.010 align:middle line:84%
wrong about the other guy
and the other approach,

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:90%
but what he was wanting.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And that had to do with respect
and safety for the traditions.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.141 align:middle line:90%
You're hearing the same words.

00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter which
one of us speaking this.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: It's universal.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.591 align:middle line:84%
Human respect thing.
And sovereignty.

00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:51.665 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: The respect.
Sovereignty.

00:41:51.665 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:84%
But there-- it is
also about honoring.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Honoring, yes.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Honoring the
traditions and safety.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.340 align:middle line:84%
This having these
outsiders come

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:90%
in and be in a sacred space.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's about honoring the
sacred and being and real sense

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:84%
of safety and protection
of their space.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.890 align:middle line:90%
So I got the needs.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them to
say back to each other

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.276 align:middle line:84%
what they heard each
other's needs are.

00:42:15.276 --> 00:42:15.990 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we
have to imagine this

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.061 align:middle line:84%
isn't like just a little
tiff between a boyfriend

00:42:21.061 --> 00:42:22.459 align:middle line:84%
and girlfriend.
JOHN: No, this is--

00:42:22.459 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about such
deeply entrenched differences.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.529 align:middle line:90%
And a history of conflict.

00:42:26.529 --> 00:42:27.851 align:middle line:84%
And even fear and hatred.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:42:27.851 --> 00:42:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Deep, deep conflict in
that part of the world.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:84%
This was-- but I was just going
through the process with them.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And they did it.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.310 align:middle line:84%
They ended up acknowledging
what the other person

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:90%
said they wanted.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned
to the whole group--

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.819 align:middle line:84%
because there was just
I was working with.

00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:46.340 align:middle line:90%
The whole group was watching.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.240 align:middle line:10%
And I said, does anybody in this
room not have all those needs?

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.710 align:middle line:10%
All of them?
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:10%
There's this pin drop silence.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:10%
And then there was just sort of
smiling and nodding and, yeah.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:10%
Like, yeah.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:10%
They got it.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:10%
And then I asked
them, how about we all

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:10%
work together and see
if we can find a way

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.801 align:middle line:10%
to get all those needs met?

00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And there again there
were sort of just looks

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:90%
of surprise on some faces.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I started-- we
started to look at how could--

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:84%
what would be some
ideas, some strategies

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:90%
to get those needs met?

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It didn't actually take all
that long at that point.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.611 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it was just
getting connected.

00:43:17.611 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Sure.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Getting understanding
and connection.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.143 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Well, that makes sense.

00:43:20.143 --> 00:43:22.940 align:middle line:84%
At this-- to get
out of the thinking

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.660 align:middle line:84%
that's about right and wrong
and who's right and who's wrong,

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.840 align:middle line:90%
who's good, who's bad.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:90%
And all that.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:90%
To get to a connection.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And then once that happened,
the solution came pretty--

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.730 align:middle line:90%
didn't take all that long.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It went through
a few iterations.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.800 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.197 align:middle line:84%
And then when we got
there, to the solution

00:43:38.197 --> 00:43:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that they both
agreed to--and then

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I turned to the whole room.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- well, first I
said, so this solution, which

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:84%
happened to be we sit right
outside the door and somebody

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:84%
would sit with us and they could
tell us what's going on but we

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.014 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't actually go in.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:43:50.014 --> 00:43:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So that went through
a number of exchanges.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But then-- everybody-- so
does that meet your needs

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:84%
for hospitality and connection?
And yes.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Does this meet your needs
for respect and honoring

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:90%
the traditions and safety?

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I turned the whole room
and I said, so we did it?

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's it?

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, there
was this pin drop.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.457 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Aw.
-Really.

00:44:07.457 --> 00:44:08.290 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful moment.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.171 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: It was just this-- and
then they started clapping.

00:44:10.171 --> 00:44:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh.
Haha.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:12.689 align:middle line:84%
And cheering.
Really.

00:44:12.689 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The whole room
exploded with energy.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that is so wonderful.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Of people smiling and happy.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And I-- my--

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:20.743 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: But look at that.

00:44:20.743 --> 00:44:22.244 align:middle line:84%
And every person is
looking for these things.

00:44:22.244 --> 00:44:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
To work it out in that way.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:24.570 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, and
to work it out--

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Through connection.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, instead of
[INAUDIBLE] each other.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:26.965 align:middle line:84%
Through understanding
and working together.

00:44:26.965 --> 00:44:27.664 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So they collaborated
to find a solution

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:90%
that met everybody's needs.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
excited about that.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end, the
most senior elder in the camp

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.930 align:middle line:90%
came up to us.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I like
very much what you did.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I try to do things like
that, but, you know, that was

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I was really nice what you did.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Aw.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if we knew
how to do this we wouldn't

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.190 align:middle line:84%
have to fight any more.
-OK.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.941 align:middle line:84%
So what better
endorsement is there?

00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.240 align:middle line:84%
For having chosen
that line of work.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.060 align:middle line:84%
That dharma in your
lifetime to have

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.740 align:middle line:84%
brought that to these people.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what
the trickle down effect

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.491 align:middle line:84%
was among those people
and their families even.

00:45:03.491 --> 00:45:04.190 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I'd like to go next.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You have done some
intense mediation

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:84%
with couples who find
themselves so entrenched they

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.800 align:middle line:90%
just can't find their way out.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And just to take
five minutes or so

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:84%
about maybe a couple
of cases where

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:84%
there was such polarization.
JOHN: Oh, yeah.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And you were able to bring
such healing between them.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe give us a couple
examples so we can see what's

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:84%
possible in case anyone
out here listening to this

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:84%
thinks you're in an absolutely
impossible situation

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and you have no options
in terms of how to engage

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.480 align:middle line:90%
with the other person.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear this.
-Mmhmm.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.179 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:36.179 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I regularly come
across those situations

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.030 align:middle line:90%
that seem impossible.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%
That the conflict
is just too big.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.840 align:middle line:90%
There's too much hurt.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:90%
There's too much pain.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And this one that
you referenced,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
this couple that I worked
with, they were divorced.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
issues around child support

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and visitation and things.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were-- but
they hadn't actually

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.940 align:middle line:84%
spoken to each other
for years because they

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:84%
couldn't tolerate even
having any conversation

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:03.720 align:middle line:90%
with each other at all.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked to them
individually beforehand.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And they just
basically said, well,

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- this is--
there's no hope, really.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I have absolutely no
trust of the other person.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.454 align:middle line:84%
They both said-- pretty much
the exactly the same thing.

00:46:18.454 --> 00:46:19.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: The trust us gone.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been completely betrayed
and I'm deeply just hurt

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and I have no trust and
there's just no hope.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
to go to court.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be a
big, terrible legal battle.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.094 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to try to-- this
was like a last ditch effort.

00:46:35.094 --> 00:46:36.481 align:middle line:84%
You were the last ditch effort.
Right.

00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Last effort, right.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But they both were
saying, I can't imagine

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.630 align:middle line:90%
how we can work through this.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Because there's just so much.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Now they weren't in
the same room, right?

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they couldn't even
bear to be in the same room.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.760 align:middle line:84%
One was in a European
country and one

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:90%
was in the United States.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And his was Skype--one
of them was Skyped in.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
We were all Skyped.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:53.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK.
-Skyping.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.150 align:middle line:90%
The three of us.

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And this took place
over many sessions.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So lots of individual work
with them to prepare them.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.925 align:middle line:84%
Like what I did
with you, you know?

00:47:02.925 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
That empathy for
themselves and then

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.690 align:middle line:84%
trying to imagine some
empathy for what was

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:90%
going on for the other person.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And so a lot of work preparing.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and then a number--
a number of sessions meeting

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.560 align:middle line:90%
with them together.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key things
that I helped them do

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is to notice when they
had an enemy image.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.730 align:middle line:84%
This phrase that
Marshall Rosenberg

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:90%
has used over the years.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And we picked up on it.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And call it that
process I did with you

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:90%
an enemy image process.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:84%
How do we transform
those images where

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:84%
we just see an enemy--
even if the people

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.949 align:middle line:84%
closest to us, right?
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We can still see the
other that's against us.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Like she was saying.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so how do we
literally-- not just

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
have the idea that
we should change it,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.960 align:middle line:90%
but actually it dissolves away.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So during the mediation,
as well as before,

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I worked on-- with them on how
to help them notice they had

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that image that they
literally weren't, like, kind

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the other person.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:58.400 align:middle line:90%
They just saw this image.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And help them be aware of that
and catch that and give them

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.550 align:middle line:84%
enough support in the
moment to keep trying

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to get into-- deeper
and deeper into what

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
was going on for each
of them that they

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.420 align:middle line:90%
were trying to express.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.430 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They must have had
such deep sadness at the core.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:90%
At the core, it was.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It was just tremendous grief.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.729 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:16.729 --> 00:48:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But it went from this anger
and bitterness and resentment

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of grief.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And they actually started
sharing the grief.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And they shared
things with each other

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.175 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
hear before that.

00:48:27.175 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, there was
more to the story.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The other person didn't quite
know it or couldn't hear it.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And they started being able to
really, like, make sense of,

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's why you did it.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.480 align:middle line:90%
That's why you did it.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I could never understand
why you did that.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.425 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:41.425 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:84%
That that stuff started
to come out as well.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The deep grief
for what they went

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.570 align:middle line:84%
through, and also the
sadness of the impact

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.270 align:middle line:90%
on the other person that--

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And imagine what this
was doing to the life.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.886 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Oh, and the children.
Yeah.

00:48:55.886 --> 00:48:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Or rather children.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so what you were
able to help them do,

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.410 align:middle line:84%
essentially you
diffused the anger.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.494 align:middle line:84%
You diffused all of the anger
and resentment that goes--

00:49:04.494 --> 00:49:05.460 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Well, it came up a lot.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It just kept coming up.
-Yeah.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And then to catch
it and work with them

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and help and-- each one of
them, and help them then

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:90%
try to hear each other.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Would you say what you're
hearing another person say?

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.605 align:middle line:84%
After they got enough
understanding for themselves.

00:49:17.605 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:84%
They got to the point at the
end-- it was very hard work.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It was many times that they
almost couldn't get through it.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And we got to the end where they
were genuinely expressing care

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and tenderness for each other.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.819 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Aw.
-And--

00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:36.597 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying if it
could happen with them--

00:49:36.597 --> 00:49:38.090 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: And they worked together.
-Yeah.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.910 align:middle line:84%
They found a solution
together to all the issues

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:40.840 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And they both felt
really good about it.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And after that, they were
able to work together

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:46.890 align:middle line:90%
on various issues that came up.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They could talk to
each other again.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:90%
They could communicate.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And they had a pretty
good relationship.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, congratulations to
all three of you in that one

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.080 align:middle line:84%
because they had to
be willing to show up.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they were-- the
stakes were high enough.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.230 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Oh, they worked hard.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there
are many people

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.101 align:middle line:84%
listening to this who have
some high stakes going on too.

00:50:02.101 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.301 align:middle line:84%
That can feel the
beauty in this process.

00:50:06.301 --> 00:50:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean you--
JOHN: There is a way.

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You would say-- would you say
that unless a person is really

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.330 align:middle line:84%
mentally unstable to
the point that they

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:84%
really-- like psychotic
behavior, for example.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Or this kind of
borderline personalities.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't really work
with someone in that situation,

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:90%
can you?

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd-- what you're
pointing to, the challenge is--

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.660 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.089 align:middle line:84%
 --a lot higher.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I like to be aware
of, though, if I have a label,

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
if I'm carrying a
label of somebody

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:46.311 align:middle line:84%
of borderline or difficult
person or a narcissist or--

00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right.
-Right.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.832 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:50:48.832 --> 00:50:50.770 align:middle line:84%
That what I've
learned over the years

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is that that becomes-- if
that's who I see-- if I'm seeing

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.300 align:middle line:84%
somebody through that
lens of that label--

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's a difference
between being really

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.350 align:middle line:84%
honest and clear about
what people's behaviors are

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about earlier.
REGINA: Right.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.760 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You can name the observation
of what I see you doing.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's a different step
to then take it into what's

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.370 align:middle line:90%
the label to put on it.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you can keep
that seperate--

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.656 align:middle line:90%
So if you've identified-- yeah.

00:51:13.656 --> 00:51:15.460 align:middle line:84%
If you've identified, OK,
I see what's going on here.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.540 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: I see the behavior.
-This is borderline person.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: And I can get
in touch with my--

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.846 align:middle line:90%
They're a psychopath-- yeah.

00:51:18.846 --> 00:51:20.312 align:middle line:84%
-My unmet needs, right?
-Mmhmm.

00:51:20.312 --> 00:51:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a difference
between saying what you are,

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
psychopath or borderline or
too-- I see these behaviors.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel scared,
worried, sad, or angry.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it might be.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:90%
But own my feelings.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:90%
They aren't about--

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.430 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Telling what's wrong with you.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:37.774 align:middle line:90%
But it's like, OK.

00:51:37.774 --> 00:51:39.240 align:middle line:84%
You're doing this and
I have these feelings.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And then what needs of mine
are not met by your behavior

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
that I could label in this way?

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So have you found
these people--

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:84%
even if you're taking a pretty
extreme kind of personality

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:84%
disorder, it can also be
worked with in this way

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:55.900 align:middle line:84%
even if there often isn't an
obvious sense of compassion

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.920 align:middle line:90%
or empathy at all?

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.714 align:middle line:84%
Maybe empathy appears to be
missing in their behaviors

00:51:59.714 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lifetime?

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.560 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
Right.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Can--and because I want to get
on to your kids in a minute.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.369 align:middle line:84%
From the mouths of babes.
-Yeah.

00:52:05.369 --> 00:52:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Just in short, can
people like this still

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:09.591 align:middle line:84%
be worked with through
nonviolent communication

00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:90%
methods?

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:84%
I like something that
I heard from Marshall

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Rosenberg many years ago.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's just--it's
reverberated for me ever since.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that if we can
do-- if I can focus

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
my attention and my language
and this way of listening

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and empathizing and
using these distinctions

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.895 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about,
then it's inevitable.

00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:28.680 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.490 align:middle line:84%
That connection
and compassionate

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.730 align:middle line:84%
giving and receiving is
another thing I learned.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.337 align:middle line:84%
That that way of being connected
as human beings is inevitable.

00:52:36.337 --> 00:52:37.670 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Regardless
of what's showing up.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:39.034 align:middle line:84%
If I stay with it.
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that--
I think that's the hardest.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:90%
We give up because it's so hard.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And some-- being with
certain people, it's

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:48.100 align:middle line:84%
just maybe more than we have
the skill or ability or capacity

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.540 align:middle line:90%
or patience to deal with.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But I really-- I found that
over the years in my experience.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:58.320 align:middle line:84%
If I don't give in to
seeing you as this label

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and I keep just seeing
you as doing these things,

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:84%
not meeting the needs
for me, and what

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.630 align:middle line:90%
needs could you be meeting.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So this idea I learned from
Marshall is so precious.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.660 align:middle line:84%
That everything people
do, if we can look at it,

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.491 align:middle line:84%
is they're doing the best they
know how to meet their needs.

00:53:12.491 --> 00:53:13.190 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.501 align:middle line:84%
If they knew a better
way, they would.

00:53:14.501 --> 00:53:15.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Beautiful.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And if I can see that,
I don't have to agree

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:90%
or like their strategies.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.604 align:middle line:84%
I could be horrified by the way
they're meeting their needs.

00:53:21.604 --> 00:53:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But that is the best they
are capable of in the moment.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But if I can see
their needs behind it,

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.661 align:middle line:84%
I feel a connection as a human
being to human being again.

00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:29.550 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-We're connected again.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I have that,
then there's hope--

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:33.891 align:middle line:84%
there's always a possibility
for me that we can get to some--

00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:34.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.723 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
really tough stuff.

00:53:35.723 --> 00:53:37.384 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about from
the mouths of babes

00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and your two little children.
JOHN: Yes.

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a couple
little stories-- that you

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:42.430 align:middle line:84%
just hinted at off camera.
REGINA: Yes.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.775 align:middle line:84%
I'd like hear about
your son, Argin.

00:53:44.775 --> 00:53:45.480 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: My son.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And your daughter, Terika.
JOHN: Yeah.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so--

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.865 align:middle line:90%
Because we-- little kids.

00:53:49.865 --> 00:53:50.970 align:middle line:84%
JOHN: Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.880 align:middle line:90%
That's where it starts.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.920 align:middle line:90%
And parenting.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Parenting and having a family
has been one of my best

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.920 align:middle line:90%
training grounds for--you know?

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.150 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Mediating conflict.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.680 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So a couple
little short examples.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.080 align:middle line:90%
JOHN: Yeah.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So Argin.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a time a
while-- he's five now.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:90%
But it was a little while ago.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was--we were about
to have dinner and he

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:14.760 align:middle line:90%
was sitting on the couch.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And we all got to the table.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Argin, come
over to dinner now.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.630 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have dinner.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Silence.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Argin, would you
come over to dinner?

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.350 align:middle line:90%
And, nope.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.396 align:middle line:90%
I'm playing.

00:54:27.396 --> 00:54:30.000 align:middle line:84%
He had this real kind
of tone to his voice.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.433 align:middle line:84%
Like, no.
You know?

00:54:31.433 --> 00:54:32.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:35.675 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him a
few more times kind

00:54:35.675 --> 00:54:38.780 align:middle line:90%
of trying to be nice about it.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he just,
you know, he wouldn't

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:44.370 align:middle line:84%
answer after-- so I got up
from the table to go over.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And I had this image in my mind.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I was going to take
the toy out of his hand

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and bring him over to
the table, you know?

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.730 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Mmhmm.
-And use some--

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:52.540 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Be the enforcer.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.040 align:middle line:84%
 --gentle force to kind
of get him over there.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.321 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I notice
that I was triggered.

00:54:57.321 --> 00:54:58.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I was having-- I
was kind of angry.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.450 align:middle line:84%
A little irritated.
You know?

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had this image--
things going through my mind

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.554 align:middle line:84%
about kind of disrespectful
and not caring about the family

00:55:06.554 --> 00:55:07.320 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Respect again.
-Yeah.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I went over and--
but so I noticed it.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I got over to
the couch and I just

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.950 align:middle line:84%
started to sit down next
to him, I caught myself

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and I just took a breath.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I just took a breath.

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have this-- I
have a lot of training

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that I do with myself every
day that helps me to practice

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that self-connection, connecting
into my breath, my body

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.541 align:middle line:84%
sensations, and some
needs going on in me.

00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:30.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.031 align:middle line:84%
So I just dropped
in there real quick.

00:55:33.031 --> 00:55:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Took a moment.
And then I looked up at him.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I saw-- suddenly I just
saw something on his face

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that he looked kind of angry.

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But he also-- I
thought I saw something

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.390 align:middle line:90%
that looked like sadness.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like this
fresh seeing of something.

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.895 align:middle line:84%
And said, Argin-- and it
just came out of my mouth.

00:55:51.895 --> 00:55:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Argin, are you
angry but also sad?

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:57.361 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and I had no idea
I was going to say this.

00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.060 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It just came out in moment--
because I'm going on a trip

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.440 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow?

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.190 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Aw.
OK.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.451 align:middle line:84%
And he just--
REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:07.150 align:middle line:90%
 --stopped.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.625 align:middle line:84%
And he looked up at me
with these big brown eyes.

00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't say a word.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.659 align:middle line:84%
He just looked up at me.
REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:14.981 align:middle line:84%
And I interpret
that as thank you.

00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:16.260 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-For hearing me.

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you were able to
just stop yourself long

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:20.670 align:middle line:90%
enough to touch in with him.

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we all
need to do for each other.

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And we're out of time.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say it seems to me
that nonviolent communication,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:84%
not just coming to you to
help mediate others' lives.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But we need-- this
is something that we

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:35.920 align:middle line:84%
should actually be
able to take advantage

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.360 align:middle line:90%
of and develop in ourselves.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And just really quickly,
we only have a couple

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.040 align:middle line:90%
seconds left, is that possible?

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Can people come in and
do personal training

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.201 align:middle line:84%
for their own lives?
-Yes.

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Definitely.
-Good.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.150 align:middle line:84%
We teach people how
they can mediate not only

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:49.870 align:middle line:84%
for other people,
help other people,

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but how you can mediate your
own conflicts with others

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and your own inner
conflicts in a way

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that-- with the same
principles of creating

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that connection that leads
to this kind of compassion

00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that happens.
-Yes.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Very good.
Well, well done.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Fabulous work you
do in the world.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We need thousands if not
millions more of you.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your time.

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us today.

JOHN: Thank you, Regina.

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been
enlightening for you.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.880 align:middle line:90%
It certainly has for me.

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:84%
If you feel you have a need
for a deeper kind of dialogue

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with someone you ordinarily
have difficulty with,

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.150 align:middle line:84%
you can go to John's website
at mediateyourlife.com

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to find out more about
nonviolent communication.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
