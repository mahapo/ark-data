00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting from
The Conscious Life Expo

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a question.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.631 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that you are living
up to your highest potential?

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
you could actually

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
change the physiology
of your brain

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
through a progressive technique
called higher brain living?

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a revolutionary
gentle-touch technique,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
founded by Dr. Michael Cotton.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And it enables you
to shift your energy

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
from your lower primitive brain
to your prefrontal cortex,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
or your higher brain,
where your potential lives.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.469 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL COTTON: My pleasure.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.545 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm so interested in anything
that has to do with the brain.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:90%
So how did you get into this?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
How did you discover
higher brain living?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, many years ago
I had a profound experience that

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
changed the entire
direction of my life.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had gone through
life as a very stressed out

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
child, very anxious,
very fearful.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But I developed chronic,
almost disabling headaches.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was in and out
doctor's offices.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And nobody could ever help me.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of fumbled
my way through life.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:90%
And I went to high school.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I managed to somehow
graduate from high school.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But all this without any
real direction or purpose,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of stress,
and a lot of fear.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a good family, good
parenting, a good household.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was from.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
But I ended up going to college.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.842 align:middle line:84%
And I started college
because I was just

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
told that's what you
were supposed to do.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.805 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And I got into
the middle of my first year.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And before my first
year was over,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to leave the college
because I was academically

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:90%
ineligible with a 0.57 GPA.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
0.57.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, OK.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: So I was basically--

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where was this?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
In the Midwest?

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: This was
in the Midwest.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
And so I was actually
kicked out of college

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
because my grades
weren't good enough

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to continue by the
end of my first year.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I started taking
minimum wage jobs.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.494 align:middle line:84%
I fumbled from one minimum wage
job to the next, just living

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:90%
for the weekend.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:90%
I had no direction, no purpose.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who I was
or where I was going.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my mid 20s,
and at my latest job.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a steel
and aluminum fabrication

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:90%
factory covered in grease.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was standing there.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And one day, something
just came over me.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was like I just woke up.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was a surge
of energy in me.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%
There was a clarity in me.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.031 align:middle line:90%
There was a confidence in me.

00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The way I describe
it, it was like I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:90%
had this view from 50,000 feet.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my entire
life, how it had led me there.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there anything
that had happened?

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.679 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Nothing.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
There was no
precipitating event.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of what
put me on this journey

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
is because it was just like I
had this surge of confidence,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.104 align:middle line:84%
and clarity, and knowing that my
life was going to be radically

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
different from
that point forward.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
foregone conclusion.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It was only a question of
how was that going to happen.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.054 align:middle line:90%
And I left the job right then.

00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went and I
got on the phone.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.219 align:middle line:84%
And earlier in my life, I
had had a positive healing

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:90%
experience with a chiropractor.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: So I was just
looking at a path for me.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well,
that's going to be a step.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I called the
chiropractic college.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And they, of course,
said well, it's

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
a four-year
postgraduate program.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a doctoral program.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not getting
in with your 0.57 first year

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:90%
of college.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So they gave me some direction.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found a college
that would take me.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And I enrolled in classes.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And by then, I was just
on fire with passion.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just aced
all of my classes.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: I started taking
32 credit hours a semester,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
more than twice the
normal load of physics,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.175 align:middle line:90%
and chemistry, and biology.

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it because
you were finally

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:90%
interested in something?

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Yes, but it
was more than that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened
inside of me is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.922 align:middle line:84%
what got me interested
in something.

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It switched on.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Right.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.346 align:middle line:90%
Something switched on in me.

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And I know now what that is.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I know that the dormant part
of the higher brain engaged.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.252 align:middle line:90%
But, at the time, I didn't.

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I had
dramatically changed.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
And so I aced all of my classes.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I got into the
professional school.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I did the four-year doctoral
program in three years

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:90%
on an accelerated program.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.177 align:middle line:84%
I graduated with honors on
the National Deans List.

00:04:36.177 --> 00:04:38.755 align:middle line:84%
And I say all of this because
that had not been my history.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It wasn't the case.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.655 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: It was not the case.

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that set me
on this path of I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
got just incredibly
curious about why me?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Why did my life
change so dramatic?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that studying
human potential

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and human
transformation basically

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
become my life's passion,
and my life's work,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.024 align:middle line:90%
and still is today.

00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you wanted to
find out why that happened?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.957 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And where did you go?

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:09.915 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously you
went down this long path,

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
but where did you
go to find out?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.401 align:middle line:90%
What was that moment?

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
What was that turning
point for you?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, what I
started doing was just

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
devouring everything that I
could possibly read, or study,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
or participate in
that had anything

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to do with personal
transformation,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
with self-help, with the
evolution of consciousness,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Eastern philosophies,
Western philosophies.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just spent my
life studying all of it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and then starting to learn
different energy work

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I started, through
my chiropractic training,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
then getting involved
in different quasi-type

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
chiropractic techniques
and energy techniques.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
NSA care was one of them
that had a lot of influence.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that
I found in my search that was

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
somewhat disturbing was
that what happened to me--

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually studied 5,000-year
history of personal growth

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I found lots of
references to this kind

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of thing happening.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Or even people would report like
the enlightenment experience

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing from all

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of the literature, all of
the techniques I studied,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of the data was that
it didn't happen very often.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It didn't happen to
very many people.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.185 align:middle line:84%
It was very inconsistent and
was often not sustainable.

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And even these techniques that
could lead to dramatic change,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
it was like 1 out
of 1,000 people

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that it would
actually happen with.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it got me really trying
to figure out why was that?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
If it was possible
for me, if even

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe even more
dramatic things were

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.247 align:middle line:90%
possible for other people--

00:06:48.247 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: --in the
literature, then

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
why wasn't it possible for
everyone, or why couldn't it

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:90%
happen all the time?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I know now, what
I'm convinced of now,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
is that the missing
link in all of this

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the literal brain
has to change for our life

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to change in those
dramatic ways.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
That we have to be
able to get energy

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
into this new-evolved,
untapped part of our brain,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
the prefrontal cortex.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now did
you equate this

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual
experience at all?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Did you find that it was a
religious epiphany at all,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:90%
or was it just a clarity?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: At the time, I
didn't really-- I mean, all

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I knew was that I had
an energy inside of me.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
I had a passion inside of me.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I had a confidence inside of me.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had a clarity inside of
me that I had never had before.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
it just turned on.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now you have now
then equated this to the brain.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Explain, if you
can, the difference

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
between the lower-brain thinking
and the higher-brain thinking,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.214 align:middle line:84%
the primitive and the
prefrontal cortex.

00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Right.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's even more
than just thinking.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Those brains really kind
of drive our behavior even.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And so thinking
absolutely is part of it.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just to
back up a second,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
here's a really good way
to kind of understand

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the need for getting energy
into that higher brain,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and why so many
things don't lead

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to sustainable
transformative change

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
is that you can learn
positive thoughts.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.865 align:middle line:90%
You can set great goals.

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Affirmations.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Affirmations,
wonderful goals,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
great-life strategies,
positive thinking, but what

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm insisting is that if
those thoughts, and goals,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
and affirmations, and
ideas-- if those don't become

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.937 align:middle line:84%
anchored to the
prefrontal cortex,

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
to the higher part
of the brain, which

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.853 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the brain that
wants to change, and grow,

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and evolve, then
they're just fleeting.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they're
anchored to the lower brain.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:90%
That's why we don't change.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.406 align:middle line:84%
And so you asked me what's
the difference in the lower

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:90%
brain and the higher brain?

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that lower brain
is a very primitive part

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
know this, but the brain

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
is actually evolved
in stages, in layers.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And the early stage
is what we generically

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
call this lower brain.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And its job is to protect you
in a predator-rich environment.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.295 align:middle line:84%
Its job is to keep you from
being eaten by a tiger.

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the caveman days, and
that's what we needed to have.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: That's right.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
It was fight or flight.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.329 align:middle line:84%
It was how do I get
through the day?

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
How do I survive in this
hostile, predator-rich world?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's important, OK?

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual connection,
and purpose, and growth,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and evolution, and finding
your potential-- that's

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.974 align:middle line:84%
not important when
you have to survive,

00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
when you have to find food,
and you have to not get eaten.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And so
that lower brain

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
was in the species for
a very, very long time.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's still in the species.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not changed since
caveman days, OK?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.967 align:middle line:84%
What's happened is layers build
over that old lower brain.

00:09:58.967 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Through evolution.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Through evolution.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And now we have--
the latest emergent

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
is this prefrontal
cortex, this highest,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
most evolved part of our brain.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.335 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the researcher
Paul MacLean,

00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
who's the one-- who was
one of the first ones

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to really tease out these
discrete layers of brain

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
development, he refers
to those frontal lobes

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and that prefrontal
cortex as the angel

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
lobes because that's the
part of the brain where

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.637 align:middle line:84%
we have that high-end
human experience.

00:10:27.637 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.145 align:middle line:84%
So when we had the industrial
age, and now the technology

00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:34.987 align:middle line:84%
age, did that make significant
impacts on those layers

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we didn't just go
from primitive to higher.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Did the steps in between
have to do with this?

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Oh, man, are you
ever speaking my language.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: No, that's
a very, very apt--

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:84%
those are some dots that I
have connected through this.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to talk
about this a little later,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
but maybe this is a good
place to jump into it.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So just real quick about the
lower brain, higher brain.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So the lower part of the
brain, that is where stress

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
is produced.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to keep
us from being eaten, OK?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.216 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same in
us today as it was back

00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
when the environment
was predator-rich.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
it's unconscious.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.835 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: It's unconscious.

00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But now we've evolved these
higher brain structures,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is the research
tells us they're latent,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
they're dormant.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The prefrontal cortex is used--
5% to 10% of its potential

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
is all that's really
used in humanity, OK?

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
untapped potential.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like we evolved, we
emerged the structure,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
but we haven't got the energy
in it, and molded it in a way,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and are able to
metabolize it in a way,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and live from
there consistently.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the beautiful
point that you just made

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is that actually
human civilization

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
has gone through five
major transformations.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
different models of this.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
One of them that's
easy to explain

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
is the great
historian Jean Gebser

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
who has measured these
five discrete layers of--

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Human evolution.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Of human evolution,
of cultural evolution, culture

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.545 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness over
the last 100,000 years.

00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And they've gone from
this archaic, fight or flight

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
into a magic, into a
mythic, into a rational,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
which you're calling
technological-- he calls

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the rational, or mental
structure-- and then

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
into this postmodern
humanistic stage that we're

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:90%
kind of all a part of.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.101 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I just
want to grasp this.

00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So magic, mythics, you
have Plato, Hipocrates,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.144 align:middle line:84%
all of those in the
magic, mythic, and--

00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well,
they were actually

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
early examples of this
rational stage of development.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Greece was one
of the first flourishings

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.407 align:middle line:84%
of this rational
mental structure,

00:12:48.407 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Or stage of
consciousness and culture.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would think so.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I am suggesting, and
the point that you kind of

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
intuitively captured there
is that these stages-- each

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of these stages of
consciousness evolution

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
have produced more care, more
compassion, more love, more

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.465 align:middle line:84%
That's been a hallmark of this
evolution of consciousness over

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
a 100,000-year year period in
cultures and in individuals.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what I am suggesting
is that it correlates

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
with these layers
of brain development

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that have been layed down
through biological evolution.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:31.439 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And so that
there's relationships

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
between the lower
part of the brain

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and these lower
stages of development.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
However, this lower
brain, it is still

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
a strong center of
gravity in most of us.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And it has its hooks
in all of this.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.555 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
90% of our behavior

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:84%
is based on that
lower brain thinking.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: That's exactly it.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so getting energy into
that prefrontal cortex,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
into that untapped
part of the brain,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe is the key not only
to be able to accelerate,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
or evolve, consciousness
in us, but it's also

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
how we're going to create that
next epoch, that next stage

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of cultural development,
or human consciousness.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would explain why
personal development doesn't

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.126 align:middle line:84%
work on most people, why new-age
thinking doesn't work on most

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
people because you
can't take a purpose

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and plant it into the
survival center of the brain.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: That's it.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It won't work.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.333 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: You better believe it.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:90%
It won't work.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have kind of
a little catchphrase

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
we like to use regarding
the lower brain.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And to the lower brain,
sameness equals safety.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The lower brain wants
your life to be the same.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And understand, below
the conscious threshold,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.392 align:middle line:90%
it's dominating your life.

00:14:42.392 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
it's happening.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it fears change.

00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: It fears change.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine
100,000 years ago,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you're living in a cave as
this caveman and cave woman.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.666 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the cave
crumbles from something.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's threatening
your survival.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: It is.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Or you have to go
and get food, OK?

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
food for your clan.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So you go out of the
cave, and let's say

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.574 align:middle line:90%
there's five paths out there.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is your first time.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a new cave
that you've found.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It's your first time
out of the cave.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Your family is in
there with you.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:90%
You go out.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
There's five paths.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:90%
You turn left down a path.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You walk about 100 yards.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
A sabre toothed tiger comes over
the ridge and tries to eat you.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And you run as fast as you can.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.267 align:middle line:90%
And you jump in the cave.

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that
the lower brain did was

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
register you are not turning
left ever again, right?

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The next morning
you're starving.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Your family is starving.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:90%
You have to go out.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.756 align:middle line:90%
You're somewhat scared.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You go out, and there's
all these paths here.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.713 align:middle line:84%
And you say OK, what's the
furthest one from left?

00:15:37.713 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the furthest
one to the right.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:90%
You walk right, you walk down.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And now this path is much
more rocky than the other one.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Your feet are now
getting bruised up,

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and they're getting bloody.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.267 align:middle line:90%
But you keep on walking.

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You keep on going, and
now you're in briars.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And the briars are
cutting your body up.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in this mucky
swamp, and it smells horrible,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
but you keep going.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
You get to this
clearing over there

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
where you're having to
pick these berries out

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.936 align:middle line:84%
of these thorny trees that
are cutting your arms up.

00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And you get enough berries to
eat and go back to your cave.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So you go back exactly the
same way, cutting your feet up.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, two days later when
you're starving again,

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and you have to go
get food, are you

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:90%
going to go to the far left?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.708 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
tiger over there.

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:22.187 align:middle line:84%
And the lower brain is not
going to let you go there.

00:16:22.187 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.145 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And it's
also not going

00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:84%
to let you take a chance on
any of those other paths.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It's going to say we're going to
go right, even if your feet get

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:36.207 align:middle line:84%
cut up, even if your body gets
cut up because it did not--

00:16:36.207 --> 00:16:37.665 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it
didn't kill you.

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:38.873 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: It didn't kill you.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:90%
You got berries.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:90%
You got food.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
You fed your family.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.962 align:middle line:84%
And that's all the
lower brain cares about.

00:16:42.962 --> 00:16:44.961 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This would explain
repeating bad habits,

00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctional relationships.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: That's exactly it.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the modern world,
how that plays out

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is that in our relationships,
in our finances,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
our intellectual brain says
oh, I want to have more money.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't want to be in
this rotten relationship.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
Or I hate the
condition of my body.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't like
feeling this way.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
The lower brain
says that's perfect.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%
You woke up alive.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: That was our job.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do it again tomorrow.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.397 align:middle line:84%
And so you set new goals, new
plans, new visions, new ideas.

00:17:18.397 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And you start out on that
path and the lower brain says,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
oh no you don't.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And it cycles you back
into the same life

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:90%
that allows you to wake up.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.355 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now how did
you equate this concept

00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:29.896 align:middle line:84%
of what you're
talking about in terms

00:17:29.896 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
of these stages of
the brain development

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to what you do with the
higher-brain living?

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:84%
How did you connect
these two big pieces?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, the
connection there

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is that part of our
kind of jumping ahead

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
of the game a little bit are--
I mean, part of my passion

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is that now that I
am really, really

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
convinced that the missing link
in not only-- see, what we know

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.255 align:middle line:84%
from this technique is that when
energy shifts into the higher

00:17:54.255 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:84%
brain of people, they start
to feel like what I described

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
happened to me spontaneously
many, many years ago.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
They start to feel more
confidence, more clarity, more

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.336 align:middle line:90%
empowerment, more purpose.

00:18:08.336 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
All of that starts to
show up because they're

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
getting energy and metabolism
in that part of the brain.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So we have a system.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a 22-step program,
45-minute long sessions

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
with a trained licensed
facilitator that shifts energy

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
into this higher
part of the brain.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And as that happens, they're
able to take this guidebook

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and apply that to all
areas of their life.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
create a new life.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Higher consciousness
create a new life.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Now when a significant
minority of people

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
elevate their consciousness,
change their brain physiology,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
create a new life, a
significant minority of those

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.685 align:middle line:84%
has enough impact to
create a new culture.

00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How big is that
significant minority?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, my
feeling is it's 1%, OK?

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The historian Paul
Tillich has shown

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that the Renaissance, which
was actually the major surge

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
from the mythic stage into
the rational, or mental, stage

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
of development--
the Renaissance was

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
the first really
major piece of that.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greece
started it, but that's

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
where it really moved up.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:84%
He says that the Renaissance
was the result of the actions,

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors, and
new ways of thinking

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
of 500 to 1,000 people.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.646 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And that
that was the catalyst

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:90%
that created the tipping point.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think in today's
age, it's going

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to be much more than that.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.061 align:middle line:84%
But it does not
require everyone.

00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's interesting.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So does somebody have
to have a purpose,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
or even want to have
a purpose in order

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:90%
to have this work be effective?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Oh, by no stretch--
in fact, a lot of people

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
come because they
don't have purpose.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
happens-- and that's, I think,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, in the business you're
in, you can relate to this.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many people
out there right now.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe that
whole postmodern stage

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of development-- that's been
our leading edge right now--

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
in that there's so many of us
out there that are feeling this

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
shift that know that--

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something's out there.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.118 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Something's
out there, and we are not

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling all that's
possible for us.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We're not living up
to that potential.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
That there's more.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And that so many people find us
because that's stirring inside

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's one of the
biggest-- I have been doing

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.693 align:middle line:84%
this for 13 years, at
least, interviewing people--

00:20:39.693 --> 00:20:42.205 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the main
titles that comes through.

00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:43.746 align:middle line:84%
And every book that's
submitted to me

00:20:43.746 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
has got the word
purpose in the title.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Right.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.845 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: People are
looking for their purpose,

00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
wanting a purpose-driven life,
knowing that that gives them

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, and passion,
and satisfaction.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
how to get to it.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.593 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:20:55.593 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have a
purpose-driven life,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.784 align:middle line:84%
you die in certain
areas of your life.

00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Henry David Thoreau
had a wonderful quote.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
He said most men and women
live lives of quiet desperation

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and go to the grave with
their song still in them.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm, very well said.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.515 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So now I mentioned earlier,
it's a gentle-touch therapy.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.564 align:middle line:84%
So how does the touch, and where
did you discover those points?

00:21:20.564 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Right.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do
they move energy?

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So we all know,
you know, and I'm

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
sure television viewers,
everyone watching this show

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.745 align:middle line:84%
knows that there's an
untapped part of our brain.

00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
That's not really
breaking news, right?

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
That there is
potential in there.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We only use 10%.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Yeah,
we've heard that.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:90%
There's potential in there.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say there's
potential in that higher brain

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:90%
that we're not using.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty general
agreement there.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So let's connect that dot.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing is
that I'm sure that most

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
of your viewers and you
also know that there's

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
a latent energy source in
the body that's associated

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
with certain
pathways in the body.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Through this 5,000-year search,
there's an energy in the body

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that's been called everything
from prana, to chi, to ki,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:16.756 align:middle line:84%
to kundalini, to subtle energy--
a variety from Taoist healers

00:22:16.756 --> 00:22:17.256 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, it could even
be the electronic system that

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
runs through the blood
in medical terms.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:22.992 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Right.

00:22:22.992 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that
there's a latent energy

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.450 align:middle line:84%
source, untapped energy
source, in the body.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We also have known
for thousands of years

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's associated with
certain pathways in the body.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything from Nordic
points and yoga philosophy

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to meridians and traditional
Chinese medicine.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
There are certain pathways
that have some relationship

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:90%
to this latent energy.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.903 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: What we've done
with higher-brain living

00:22:46.903 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
is we've cracked a
code around this.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.757 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at
these pathways, one,

00:22:50.757 --> 00:22:52.215 align:middle line:84%
from a very scientific
perspective.

00:22:52.215 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.586 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: There's now
a research showing

00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
that these pathways
in the body are

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:90%
what's called piezoelectric.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's a term that means
that they release energy

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
when they're compressed,
or touched, or contacted

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:90%
in just the right way.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we've patterned out a
very specific protocol where

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
we cue these pathways in
a very unique way, gently

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
in a very unique
protocol that leads

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to this piezoelectric effect,
this release of energy

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And through our
system, it travels

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.379 align:middle line:84%
to the prefrontal
cortex of the brain.

00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Have you measured this?

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.253 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yes.

00:23:28.253 --> 00:23:31.066 align:middle line:84%
We've measured it
numerous times with EEG.

00:23:31.066 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, with the EEG.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to see
these electronic pathways

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in the body, this energy
system, and it going and rushing

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:90%
to the prefontal cortex?

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:84%
What we're actually not
measuring are the pathways.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
What we're measuring is
the change in the brain.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, got it.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:90%
The end result.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: So we're able
to cue these pathways.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that when you
cue these pathways in just

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
this right protocol, this-- this
piezoelectric release of energy

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
is moving into the higher brain.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Now this is very, very gentle.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people will
actually feel energy building

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
in their higher brain.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
What happens next is the
extraordinary part of it

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because what happens
next is that it's

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.147 align:middle line:84%
a nudging that dormant
part of your brain awake.

00:24:11.147 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that dormant
part of your brain

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.085 align:middle line:90%
starts to wake up just a little.

00:24:15.085 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.895 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And it
starts to come online.

00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:17.612 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:24:17.612 --> 00:24:19.028 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And what
happens then is

00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
it starts to create-- your
brain starts to create

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:90%
its own feedback mechanism.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So these these paths
are gently cued

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
in this very revolutionary
protocol that

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
causes a release of energy
to go into that highest

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:90%
part of the brain.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
When it wakes up,
then it starts to want

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill that evolutionary
potential that's in there.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
generate its own--

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Energy.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Energy, exactly.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing that you feel

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is a breath response we call a
salutogenic breath because it's

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
a feedback mechanism
produced by the brain.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And that breath starts to move
through your body from head

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
to toe.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.741 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like
you taking the breath.

00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you're
being breathed,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.491 align:middle line:90%
or something is breathing you.

00:25:02.491 --> 00:25:04.281 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to
have the opportunity

00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:90%
to see this on a table.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.285 align:middle line:84%
But how did you-- did you
go through trial and error

00:25:08.285 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
to find these specific points?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Did you--

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yes.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And throughout this long search,
many, many, many different

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
disciplines were touching
on different pieces of this.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
You'll see some of the
contacts that I'll make.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.170 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in this
area, I found references

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
to Taoist healers
thousands of years ago

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that were talking about
doing certain pathways,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and breath changes in the
body associated with this.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Certain pathways, different yoga
systems, or Vedantic systems,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:84%
have referred to as some of
the lower chakras in the body.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And a more modern NSA
care cues similar pathways

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and certain ways,
cranial sacral therapy.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's all kinds of
these different systems

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that I think have
been tapping in it.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But what we have done
is put this together

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in a revolutionary way that
is consistent, repeatable,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
reproducible, and very
fast, and very integrated

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.579 align:middle line:90%
within your life.

00:26:09.579 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But does it last?

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.578 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: And it lasts.

00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real
beauty of it is

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that, through this
22-step program,

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
not only do you get
that upload, but you

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:90%
start to apply it to your life.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You start to bring that
higher-brain energy

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
to your relationships, to your
finances, to your occupations,

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.627 align:middle line:90%
to your dreams, to your visions.

00:26:29.627 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: What I'm maintaining
is that that's the only way it

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.017 align:middle line:84%
will last because if the lower
brain has its hooks in it--

00:26:38.017 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.308 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: If it hasn't
loosened its grip,

00:26:40.308 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cycle you back
around into the same life.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Abosolutely.

00:26:43.245 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: And that's
the missing link.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is your
goal with this technique?

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Before we have a chance
to talk to some people who

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
are going to try this
technique and experience it,

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:84%
what is your overarching
goal with this?

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: This is going to be
a very big vision and a very

00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:90%
big statement.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I always have some
reservations about these things

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
because it can come across as
sounding kind of self-serving.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's not meant to be.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.945 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask me honestly,
and authentically,

00:27:10.945 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and transparently, my goal
within this and my vision

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
within this is to
see, in my lifetime,

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
higher-brain living be
a significant vehicle

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
in shifting consciousness
in our culture

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that has ramifications worldwide
in creating that sixth epoch

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
or next stage of human
consciousness, and culture,

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and brain function.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.216 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would love to talk
to some of these ladies who

00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
experiencing this

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and find out-- so
they've experienced

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:90%
this technique in the past?

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yep.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.126 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can talk to them
about how their lives maybe

00:27:56.126 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
have changed a little bit
from-- or maybe a lot--

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: You bet.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From this technique.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: What I would like to
do, Lisa, if it's OK with you,

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to do a
demonstration with them showing

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.985 align:middle line:90%
how I cue these pathways.

00:28:04.985 --> 00:28:05.545 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: I'll condense it
down to 5 or 10 minutes, which

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
would ordinarily be a
45-minute long session.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.442 align:middle line:84%
And then have them sit
up, and then maybe just

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
have them tell of
their experience?

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound good?

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: All right.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Perfect.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take a break.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go and
look at the table right now.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Awesome.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.758 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: I'm going to
do a higher brain living

00:28:24.758 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
demonstration
session with Lizzie.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.625 align:middle line:90%
Lizzie, are you ready?

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZZIE: I am.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: All right.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Face down on the table please.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Now sessions are
usually 45 minutes long,

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
but we're condensing
them for this video.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's an untapped
part of the higher brain

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and an untapped energy
source in the body.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to cue these
pathways in just the right way

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in this revolutionary protocol
that causes a release of energy

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to go into that higher brain,
that prefrontal cortex.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it
creates its own feedback

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:90%
mechanism to energize itself.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:22.535 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.535 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
how the breath is

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
starting to expand
in Lizzie's body.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:84%
See that three-dimensional
expansion of breath?

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.295 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And you can even hear it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.985 align:middle line:84%
If the mics can pick it up,
you can hear the breath.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:90%
[BREATHING]

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:84%
That's an automatic
feedback response

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
her brain is now creating.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:90%
She's not making that happen.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
She feels it happen.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:90%
She's letting it happen.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:90%
We call it a salutogenic breath.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a signal
that this energy

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
from cuing these pathways,
that piezoelectric effect,

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:90%
moved into the higher brain.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And it started to light up
some of that dormant potential.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And that dormant potential
is coming online.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying
oh, this is good.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's fulfill all of that
potential that's in there.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's creating
its own mechanism

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.315 align:middle line:84%
to bring more
energy up to itself.

00:30:34.315 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And as this is
happening, Lizzie will

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
be feeling a sense of
confidence, clarity, joy,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
all of those things that are
associated with the higher

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And over this 22-step
program, which

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:84%
includes 22 sessions
and the application

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.330 align:middle line:84%
of this higher-brain
energy to your life,

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.075 align:middle line:84%
there's a shift in
center of gravity

00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that happens through
this 22 step program

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
where the lower dominant
brain gives its stuff up,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.530 align:middle line:90%
loosens its grip.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the energy starts to
become stabilized, or available

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:90%
always, in the higher brain.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way permanent,
long-term transformative change

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:84%
happens because it's that
part of the brain that

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
wants to grow, that
wants to create.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the lower brain
that wants to stay stuck

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and wants to stay the same.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And this process is consistent,
reproducible, repeatable.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.926 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
right here shows up

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in virtually everyone on
the very first session

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:90%
of the 22-step program.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is just the beginning.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of the contacts
are very gentle,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
but they're very precise
in a sequence that

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.830 align:middle line:84%
causes the flow of energy into
the untapped part of the brain.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally,
someone will ask me

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
if she's in a trance, or
hypnotized, or something.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually just
the opposite of that.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:90%
She's very, very aware.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Say hi, Lizzie.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.784 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZZIE: Hi.

00:32:49.784 --> 00:32:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: She knows
that it's happening.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
She feels it happening.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:90%
She's not making it happen.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
She could stop it if she wanted.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
She could even make
herself just stop it.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But the sense in her is
that my lifetime of stress

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is clearing out of my
body and out of my mind.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:90%
I feel incredible right now.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Why would I want to stop this?

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.926 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
condensed session,

00:33:13.926 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:84%
but you can really
get the point.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
Lizzie set up in a moment.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And Lisa, you can talk to her.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll bring Sunny up
and do a demonstration even

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:90%
beyond this.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So Lizzie, could I have you
sit up please nice and slow?

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.783 align:middle line:90%
That was awesome.

00:33:33.783 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:90%

is that-- we all

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.910 align:middle line:84%
know this-- to not
get too ethereal,

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:38.260 align:middle line:84%
but there's concentric
fields of energy around us.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a hard fact now,
electromagnetic energy

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.491 align:middle line:90%
and potentially subtle energy.

00:41:44.491 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're sensitive
to that energy,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
but there's also an
element where there's

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.730 align:middle line:84%
kind of the entry and
the follow-through

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:84%
to use a sporting
analogy, even someone

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that's a professional
golfer or something.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:84%
How they approach the
ball and the follow

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:84%
through after the
ball has a lot to do

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:90%
with what happens to the ball.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Not just the moment of impact.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
along those same lines.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.396 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: That how
we're coming in

00:42:13.396 --> 00:42:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going out
has an impact on how

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:20.337 align:middle line:84%
those pathways are cued and how
that piezoelectric effect moves

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:90%
to the higher brain.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: And I can teach this.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole training
program that we--

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long does that
training program take?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, there's a
couple of different models.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And if they get on
higherbrainliving.com

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:34.145 align:middle line:84%
on our website,
they're able to find

00:42:34.145 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:84%
where I'm doing different
presentations where

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I talk about that
whole training model.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But just to be brief,
there's four online modules.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
on-site modules.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.377 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:42:45.377 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Two five-day
on-site modules

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
or two ten-day on-site
modules depending on

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's standard or
advanced licencing

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:90%
on-site in a location.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what made you put
this into a training course?

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:90%
What inspired you to do that?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Well, when I opened my
first practice in the Midwest,

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I had a waiting list of
people trying to come in.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew a lot about the
evolution of consciousness.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I knew a lot about
developmental psychology.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of friends
in those fields.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And, to be just perfectly
frank, the results that we

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.630 align:middle line:84%
were seeing, the
changes in people's

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:84%
life, and knowing that the brain
was changing in association

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:84%
with that, it was so powerful,
the transformation that

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
was happening, that I knew that
it had to get into the world.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And so that's why.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is there
an energy exchange that

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.400 align:middle line:84%
happens between you and the
subject, or you and Sunny?

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Are you trying to stay
as neutral as possible?

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: There's a
very specific protocol

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:90%
that we go through.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
What she's doing on the
table happens every day

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.995 align:middle line:84%
in facilitators' offices
that are trained.

00:43:47.995 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
people now trained

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.870 align:middle line:84%
in the higher-brain
living technique.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
that's not really

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.930 align:middle line:90%
even part of my thought process.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of flowing
through this protocol,

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and her body is organically
expressing itself as bodies do.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what's inside of us.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the capacity
that's in the brain.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of the wavelike
movement is a primal pattern.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
There's been evidence for that
showing up thousands of years

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.733 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:16.329 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So I want some of what
you're having here, Sunny.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.702 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling over here?

00:44:19.702 --> 00:44:20.785 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: It feels so good.

00:44:20.785 --> 00:44:21.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You feel good?

00:44:21.665 --> 00:44:22.248 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:44:22.248 --> 00:44:24.016 align:middle line:84%
I explain it as
being blissed out.

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:24.932 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:24.932 --> 00:44:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Can you sleep after this?

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.635 align:middle line:90%
Are you energetic, or--

00:44:28.635 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Oh, yeah.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes I
get really creative.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I love that because,
at one point,

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
some of my creative
juices were not

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:84%
flowing as much as I
would like them to.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But my sleep-- even if I
have a short night's sleep,

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:44.754 align:middle line:90%
it's very restful.

00:44:44.754 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
wake up energized?

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: M-hm.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.182 align:middle line:84%
And I process a lot in my dream
state as well, which is great.

00:44:50.182 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And on purpose.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you
about mood swings.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're stressed out,
or if you're dealing with,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, different
people who are

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:84%
upset with you, job,
work, kids, family.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you handle those
things in any different way?

00:45:04.197 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:84%
What I found was
that I used to be

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.080 align:middle line:84%
more attached to the emotion
of a situation, or a story,

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.569 align:middle line:84%
or get too much into what the
other person was going through.

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUNNY: And it
really harbored things

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.749 align:middle line:90%
that would progress for me.

00:45:19.749 --> 00:45:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's how
you were in the past?

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.123 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:45:22.123 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I really recognized it
when I had this difference.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.760 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.675 align:middle line:84%
>>COTTON: Your
awareness increases.

00:45:26.675 --> 00:45:27.820 align:middle line:90%
You really can see it.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Exactly, yeah.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So now I feel like I'm able to
approach a situation, or even

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:84%
a person, a friend,
a parent, you know,

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.260 align:middle line:90%
with a different perspective.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.955 align:middle line:84%
And I can listen to
them fully and recognize

00:45:41.955 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:90%
what they're going through.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not attached to it myself.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:45.580 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you more of an
observer on your emotions now?

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.205 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:45:48.205 --> 00:45:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
you were saying?

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:49.943 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: M-hm.

00:45:49.943 --> 00:45:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Yeah.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.530 align:middle line:90%
The lower brain reacts.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It's caught in its world.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The higher brain can take
that view from 50,000 feet

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.914 align:middle line:84%
and then respond from
these new potentials.

00:45:59.914 --> 00:46:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
you've experienced?

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Most definitely.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I always thought that I
was on a really good path

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.927 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that
stuff, and lead people,

00:46:09.927 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, with my
background and everything.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.259 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:46:12.259 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Being in--

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUNNY: I'm a naturopath,
but not fully doing it.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And then now you
recognize, you know?

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So you already were
into the healing arts,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:84%
but this has amplified
that experience for you?

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.163 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yeah.

00:46:26.163 --> 00:46:28.390 align:middle line:90%
M-hm.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I knew right away that this
is what I wanted to do.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when you are
working on other people--

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:36.200 align:middle line:84%
let me ask you a
question, if I can,

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:84%
about the potential
for this healing abuse,

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.850 align:middle line:84%
emotional, physical,
sexual abuse--

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:84%
have you heard that
from anyone that

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
has been able to release that
type of pain in the body?

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.071 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Yep.

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up
happening through--

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll just go with testimonials
because obviously, you know,

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.137 align:middle line:90%
you can't like claim--

00:46:57.137 --> 00:46:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

>>SUNNY: --is going
to be with everybody.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a couple
of people that

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.960 align:middle line:84%
have had abuse and
trauma, as well.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have been able to let
their body, or the emotion,

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.474 align:middle line:90%
come up with that.

00:47:13.474 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But they've come
to terms with it.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And now they're letting it go.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They're able to grow
from where they are now.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In present time.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUNNY: Knowing that
that's part of their past,

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.080 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
They're really just fulfilling
what their dreams and passions

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
are now, recognizing
it, and they're

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:90%
able to separate from it.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So some of the emotion leaves,
even if they cry about it

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:84%
or get angry, it's
really not-- they're not

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.952 align:middle line:84%
attached to that
emotion anymore either.

00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
in more present time?

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.435 align:middle line:84%
And not living in
that past moment?

00:47:42.435 --> 00:47:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUNNY: Completely.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.419 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:43.419 --> 00:47:45.429 align:middle line:84%
They're really
embracing the moment.

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is a lot
to be said for that.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you very much.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:50.386 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for inte--

00:47:50.386 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COTTON: Great, great fun.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:52.093 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To us.

00:47:52.093 --> 00:47:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I hope you learned
as much as I did.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.380 align:middle line:84%
