>> Lisa Garr: Hi I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.423 align:middle line:84%
My guest today said
something very special to me.

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:26.627 align:middle line:84%
He said laughter is a
confirmation of transformation.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.963 align:middle line:84%
Yakov Smirnoff is my guest
and he is from Russia

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:32.399 align:middle line:84%
and he is known as
America's funniest comic.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.835 align:middle line:84%
He's written jokes for U.S.
Presidents, he's performed

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.904 align:middle line:84%
with Robin Williams
in feature films,

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.708 align:middle line:84%
he's even had his own TV
sitcom called What a Country.

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:44.178 align:middle line:84%
And today we're talking
about giving people the gift

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:47.948 align:middle line:84%
of laughter and how
laughter truly shifts energy.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.383 align:middle line:90%
Hello, welcome.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:52.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Yakov Smirnoff: Thank you
so much for having me on here.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I know.

00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:53.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Yakov Smirnoff:
It's exciting.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Very exciting.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Yakov Smirnoff: So take me
way back to growing up in Russia

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:05.566 align:middle line:84%
and what on earth made you
decide to come to America?

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:10.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Yakov Smirnoff: Well I grew
up in a very humble environment

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:13.207 align:middle line:90%
so to set the scene okay,

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:18.879 align:middle line:84%
in one apartment nine
families lived together right?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.515 align:middle line:90%
So each family occupies,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:24.251 align:middle line:84%
and this is how the
communist regime set it up,

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.588 align:middle line:84%
was somebody's wealthy
apartment then they took it over

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and they put one family
in the living room,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.893 align:middle line:84%
one family in the bedroom,
one family in the den

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:36.564 align:middle line:84%
and everybody had their
room right, and my mom

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:40.768 align:middle line:84%
and my dad shared the bedroom
until I was 26 years old.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You,
your Mom and your Dad.

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:42.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Yakov Smirnoff: Yeah.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:45.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Yakov Smirnoff: I'm
not making this up.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:46.407 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little kid
and my parents wanted

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:49.076 align:middle line:84%
to be romantic they would
send me to look out the window

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.778 align:middle line:84%
and then my dad would say so
what do you see in the window?

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.014 align:middle line:84%
I said our neighbors
being romantic

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and he said how can
you tell and I said

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:84%
because their son
is looking at me.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only child
because we had only one window.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.291 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.027 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: So, so that
was the beginning

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.731 align:middle line:84%
but something magical happened
that's totally relevant

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.267 align:middle line:84%
to what we are talking
about today.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:18.772 align:middle line:84%
When I heard my parents
laugh I felt that I was

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.407 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of love.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:25.211 align:middle line:84%
Somehow those two
were synonymous.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.582 align:middle line:84%
They were like, they
go hand in hand.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:34.555 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand what it
was as a child, however I wanted

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.392 align:middle line:84%
to hear that laughter
because that gave me a sense

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:41.895 align:middle line:84%
that I was connected to
people the right way.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I was loved.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Was there a lot
of laughter going on in

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.401 align:middle line:90%
that type of environment or?

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.936 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: My parents were able to,

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:51.405 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a funny
environment as you can imagine.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:56.343 align:middle line:84%
You're standing in line for
food, you work many, many,

00:02:56.343 --> 00:03:00.748 align:middle line:84%
many hours I mean all of those
things were normal there.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:04.518 align:middle line:84%
However my parents were
able to create the laughter

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and again it took me years
later to understand what it was,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.826 align:middle line:84%
then you have to give the right
gifts to one another that,

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:17.464 align:middle line:84%
that created that environment
and then my Dad's sense

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.867 align:middle line:90%
of humor was kind of a trigger.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.236 align:middle line:84%
He could trigger
the Mom's laughter

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:84%
and then I knew everything
was fine.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:28.275 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well your story of
even how you got here was

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.511 align:middle line:90%
incredibly loving.

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:32.746 align:middle line:90%
How your, if you could tell us

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
of how your Dad saved enough
money to come to America.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.052 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:41.121 align:middle line:90%
Well it was a surprise big time

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:44.091 align:middle line:84%
because my Mom was
the bread winner.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.461 align:middle line:84%
Mom was a teacher of
Russian literature

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.597 align:middle line:84%
and even though nobody made
a lot of money in Russia,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:84%
she was the one that
made it possible.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
My Dad was an inventor
and I loved his inventions

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't sell one
thing to save his life.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.846 align:middle line:84%
I mean no one wanted
to buy anything and

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.081 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Tough crowd probably.

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:07.881 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Huh?

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.183 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Tough crowd probably.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.518 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Tough crowd, no, I
think he was just eclectic.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:15.089 align:middle line:84%
He was just like, he, when we
came to America for example,

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.624 align:middle line:84%
would be a visual
invention that he,

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:21.528 align:middle line:84%
he invented a toilet
paper dispenser that held

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.664 align:middle line:90%
up to 18 rolls of toilet paper.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.734 align:middle line:84%
So it would go, it
was clear Plexiglas

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:28.802 align:middle line:84%
and it would go all
the way to the top

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.305 align:middle line:84%
and when one roll was empty
the other one would just

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
automatically [inaudible]
and it was very funny

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.812 align:middle line:84%
because I said Dad, why would
you want to do that and he said

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:90%
when you have toilet paper

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.585 align:middle line:84%
and you have abundance
you should flaunt it.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.254 align:middle line:84%
You should let everyone
know that you have it.

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:50.524 align:middle line:84%
Because his mentality was we
had no toilet paper in Russia.

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:51.791 align:middle line:90%
So it was like.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.329 align:middle line:84%
So those were the kind of
inventions he would make.

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: The inventions.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.868 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Right but he
was also very avangard.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:06.807 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to go to America and
my Mom was scared to death the

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:10.411 align:middle line:84%
because the Russian government
didn't want people to leave

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:16.617 align:middle line:84%
so one time he brought it up
again and my Mom kind of snapped

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.887 align:middle line:84%
at him and she said
okay Mr. Big Shot,

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:25.926 align:middle line:84%
even if we got the permission
from the Soviet Union to go,

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.428 align:middle line:90%
how could we ever afford it?

00:05:27.428 --> 00:05:32.199 align:middle line:84%
And this is when he totally
surprised both my Mom and I.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.402 align:middle line:84%
He went to the kitchen
cupboard, he got a coffee can

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.372 align:middle line:84%
that was sitting all the way
in the back and he pried open

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:84%
that coffee can and
inside there was money,

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.646 align:middle line:84%
like rolls of money
stuffed in the coffee can.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:49.216 align:middle line:84%
And my Mom and I were staring
in disbelief and in shock.

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:56.957 align:middle line:84%
My Mom said where in the
world did you get coffee?

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] And where is
all this money coming from?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.264 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening, my
Dad after inventing a lot

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:07.801 align:middle line:84%
of crazy gadgets, he invented
something that was successful.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
He invented a device that would
test integrity of concrete

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and it was a small
device, it hit the concrete

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
at a certain speed
and leave a mark

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.083 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you measure what,
how strong the concrete is.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.853 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know concrete
had integrity.

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:28.322 align:middle line:84%
You know who would tell
you about that right?

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So, but, and my Dad didn't want
to tell anyone because he wanted

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.798 align:middle line:84%
to keep that secret that
someday he'll make a better life

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:38.499 align:middle line:90%
for his family.

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow, wow.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.136 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And it was life
changing, life changing.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.806 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so you came
to America and then

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.408 align:middle line:90%
at what point did you decide

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:84%
that being a comedian was
a way to make a living.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:58.819 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Well I was a comedian
in Russia so, so I was hopeful

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.588 align:middle line:84%
that someday I could
make Americans laugh.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.291 align:middle line:90%
However, I didn't speak English.

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:05.292 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle line:84%
So I locked myself in
the room and I watched TV

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:90%
for three months straight

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.101 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized it was
a Spanish station so I had

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.036 align:middle line:90%
to start all over again.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:19.673 align:middle line:84%
But I was very determined
and then I got a job as,

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:24.444 align:middle line:84%
as a bartender and in
the bar I was kind of,

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.748 align:middle line:84%
was able to tell people jokes
and they would ask me things

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:32.085 align:middle line:84%
like you know 7 and 7
and I would say it's 14

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.988 align:middle line:84%
and they would laugh and you
know and they would ask me

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:37.257 align:middle line:90%
like give me a black Russian

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.426 align:middle line:84%
and I would say what's
happening comrade.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.361 align:middle line:84%
You know, you know and
people would get to know me

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:44.831 align:middle line:90%
and they would give me tips

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:48.001 align:middle line:84%
and they would ask me-I had
the name tag and it said Yakov

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:50.837 align:middle line:84%
and they say, Yakov Smirnoff,
and they would say is

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.541 align:middle line:84%
that your real name, I said
no it used to be Jack Daniels.

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:58.178 align:middle line:84%
They would laugh again so
that was my training kind

00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.947 align:middle line:90%
of to start doing comedy.

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:04.651 align:middle line:84%
And then little by little I
got to Hollywood and I came,

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.054 align:middle line:90%
I started at the Comedy Store

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:11.058 align:middle line:84%
and this was an incredible
lineup of people at that time.

00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:18.865 align:middle line:84%
Robin Williams just hit number
one as Mork and Mindy show

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.734 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh yes.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:24.438 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: On ABC and then David
Letterman was just coming

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:29.343 align:middle line:84%
out to get his own
morning show at that time.

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.777 align:middle line:84%
Jay Leno, Billy Crystal,
Richard Pryor.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.113 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: This was in the 80s?

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:37.551 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: It was late
70s, 79, 80, 81.

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.152 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:42.122 align:middle line:84%
When I sat there
and I saw that show

00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:45.292 align:middle line:84%
of that lineup I said wow I
just died and went to heaven.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.494 align:middle line:84%
I've got to stay
here no matter what.

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:51.331 align:middle line:84%
And I got a job, Mitzi Shore
the owner of the Comedy Store,

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:55.836 align:middle line:84%
gave me a job as a carpenter
there so I could make a living

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:59.406 align:middle line:84%
and little by little
I was getting

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.742 align:middle line:90%
to be better on stage and

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:05.279 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And absorb all the-wow
what a great environment.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.615 align:middle line:84%
And now look, we have pictures
of you with Robin Williams,

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:13.787 align:middle line:84%
with we have Tom
Hanks and you went

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:90%
into an incredible stratosphere.

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.158 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yeah, Merrill
Streep and Jack Nicholson.

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:21.662 align:middle line:84%
I mean I did movies with
those people and after working

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:24.765 align:middle line:84%
with me, all of those
actors won an Oscar.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:25.899 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And I got Oscar
Myer wiener, yes, I got

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.407 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Not much.

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:37.377 align:middle line:84%
Well I mean you went on
to-we have an incredible kind

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:40.881 align:middle line:84%
of promotional reel of what
you accomplished in your life.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:41.815 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:84%
This is Yakov Smirnoff
in action.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:54.394 align:middle line:90%
[ Video Playing ]

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:14.467 align:middle line:90%
What, what an incredible career.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:18.605 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to be
known as, with this phrase

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:22.676 align:middle line:84%
"What a country" which I've
heard you say so many times?

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:27.614 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: You know the audience
kind of picks what they want

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to remember and so I was doing
my show and they would come

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:39.359 align:middle line:84%
to me after the show, because
I'd used several expressions,

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:46.666 align:middle line:84%
you know I had a joke about,
you know, I walked in a store

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:50.537 align:middle line:84%
and I always wanted freedom
and I walk in the store

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:54.741 align:middle line:84%
and I see this box
that says New Freedom.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:59.279 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.714 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing] [Inaudible]

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:03.783 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Freedom in a box, you
know, what a country, you know?

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.686 align:middle line:90%
I bought 15 of them you know?

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.922 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Sent them home to your

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:12.959 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yes exactly, mailed it
to my friends and everything.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:17.764 align:middle line:84%
So, so people would catch that
line and they would come to me

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:20.433 align:middle line:84%
and they would say, what
a country, what a country.

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So really it was the
audience that picked that

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:90%
and I just kept repeating that.

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:27.807 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then you get a
call from the White House.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:28.642 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yes.

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:29.776 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What was that like?

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:30.977 align:middle line:90%
Hi this is the White House.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.114 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Well it was strange
at first because they,

00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
they said we'd like you to
come to Washington and perform

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.153 align:middle line:90%
in front of the Bush's.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.023 align:middle line:84%
And I said that will
get me arrested.

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:46.559 align:middle line:84%
What was happening was George
Bush Sr. was the Vice President

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.863 align:middle line:84%
for President Reagan, so they
said we need to you come here

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:52.999 align:middle line:84%
to perform in front of
President Reagan's Cabinet.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I said well that's
better than the Bush's.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.607 align:middle line:84%
So I go there and you
can imagine this, let me,

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:04.411 align:middle line:90%
let me kind of set the scene.

00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:08.949 align:middle line:84%
This, this was pretty
incredible for a guy who'd been

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
in America maybe only what, two
years, two and a half years.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.688 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:15.622 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Oh my gosh.

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.823 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:19.659 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And, and so they
are, I'm walking in there

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:22.262 align:middle line:84%
and there's security
check and all

00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:28.835 align:middle line:84%
of that stuff obviously
happening and, and the officer

00:14:28.835 --> 00:14:31.871 align:middle line:84%
who is with me, who
is escorting me is

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.075 align:middle line:84%
like being frisked
and I'm going Oh God.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.176 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I mean this is a joke

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.277 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: I'm sweating.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.112 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: A Russian walks
into the White House

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:40.313 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.715 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: At that time.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:45.752 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And I'm sweating there
and then the, the people turn

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:51.725 align:middle line:84%
to me and I'm going oh, here
it goes and the guy looks at me

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:56.463 align:middle line:84%
and goes, I've seen your
Miller Lite commercial.

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:58.598 align:middle line:84%
I said yes, he said
okay come on in.

00:14:58.598 --> 00:14:59.165 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: No check.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.969 align:middle line:90%
I was like oh my gosh.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What a country.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.205 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah, what a country.

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:12.645 align:middle line:84%
So I go in and so I'm nervous
and, and the President walks in

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:16.249 align:middle line:84%
and introduce me to him and they
said Mr. President this is Yakov

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.284 align:middle line:84%
Smirnoff, he's a
Russian comedian

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:22.088 align:middle line:84%
and immediately he looks
at me and says, well,

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:26.693 align:middle line:84%
have you heard this joke, and
he proceeds to tell-he started

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
and so then now he made me
laugh and I cracked up laughing

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody looks at me,
now this was a very small event,

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.939 align:middle line:84%
there was only 18 people,
it was like a State dinner,

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.075 align:middle line:84%
and everybody looks at
me, now it's my turn

00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:45.779 align:middle line:84%
to entertain the President and
I said Mr. President, you know,

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:84%
when Americans landed on
the moon that was a big slap

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.017 align:middle line:84%
in the face to the
Soviet government.

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So [inaudible] called all the
cosmonauts into his office

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and said Americans
landed on the moon.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.925 align:middle line:90%
We have to land on the sun.

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:02.495 align:middle line:84%
They said we can't do
that, we'll burn up.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:90%
He said do you think I'm stupid?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.232 align:middle line:90%
You land at night.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:07.333 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.903 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And boy was I
happy when they laughed.

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:12.372 align:middle line:84%
So after that it was
just a whole evening,

00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.973 align:middle line:84%
we were telling jokes
to one another.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:17.377 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What an amazing
experience and why even wanted

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.712 align:middle line:84%
to meet with you
in the first place.

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.748 align:middle line:84%
Did you come to find
that out later?

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.216 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah.

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:28.354 align:middle line:84%
It was, connection was made,
there was someone who saw me

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.758 align:middle line:84%
at the Comedy Club in
Washington D.C. and they thought

00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:35.361 align:middle line:84%
that my sense of humor with
the President will connect

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:41.601 align:middle line:84%
and it did, and they thought it
would be entertaining to have me

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.604 align:middle line:90%
at dinner one way or another.

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:50.777 align:middle line:84%
It was a very interesting dinner
too because it was the night

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:53.446 align:middle line:90%
when Kaddafi was acting up

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:57.784 align:middle line:84%
and President Reagan
sent helicopters to kind

00:16:57.784 --> 00:17:01.354 align:middle line:84%
of show the muscle
of America around.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:05.225 align:middle line:84%
And behind the President for
the whole evening there was an

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:07.793 align:middle line:84%
officer standing
with a football,

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.597 align:middle line:84%
and they call it
football, it's a brief case

00:17:10.597 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
with all the nuclear codes.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.634 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.769 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah, no pressure here.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:17.904 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Tense.

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:21.273 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yeah and so I'm
sitting in front of him

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:26.044 align:middle line:84%
so the officer is behind, like
you're, he would be behind you

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.448 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling jokes,
the President is laughing,

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the officer is not
laughing right?

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:84%
And I'm worried if I bomb,
he can bomb a lot more

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:39.959 align:middle line:84%
than I could bomb so I had
a lot of pressure on me.

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.194 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Inaudible] bombing.

00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So then he subsequently,
someone called and asked you

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.332 align:middle line:84%
to write jokes for
the President.

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:49.602 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Well it was, I
simplify it a little in my show

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.037 align:middle line:90%
when I tell the story

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:54.674 align:middle line:84%
but it actually was even a
little bit more than that.

00:17:54.674 --> 00:18:00.013 align:middle line:84%
It was, they were planning
for Reagan to go to Russia

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:02.749 align:middle line:84%
and it was a big deal because an
American President had not been

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:06.019 align:middle line:84%
on Soviet soil in
decades, so it was a lot

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:90%
of pressure on everybody.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.191 align:middle line:84%
So they asked me, would
you consider looking

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:16.396 align:middle line:84%
over the speech he's going to do
there and give us your opinion?

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.933 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
why, who am I to give,

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.202 align:middle line:84%
but I said okay,
sure I'll do it.

00:18:22.202 --> 00:18:25.805 align:middle line:84%
And so they sent me the
speech and I read through it

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.408 align:middle line:84%
and I was not, I
didn't like the speech.

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:32.812 align:middle line:84%
The tone of the speech
was very not friendly.

00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:36.816 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a little
snobby or I don't know,

00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:39.586 align:middle line:84%
like we know what we're
doing and you guys don't.

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.921 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up there and
I knew that's not going

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:43.423 align:middle line:90%
to go over very well.

00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:49.195 align:middle line:84%
So I said look, at the risk of
being audited I'll tell you,

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:52.632 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't think
this is a good idea

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:56.603 align:middle line:84%
and they said would you
consider re-writing the speech.

00:18:56.603 --> 00:18:59.005 align:middle line:90%
Again, my jaw drops and

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:02.008 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I'm just thinking what
an amazing, things that go

00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:03.576 align:middle line:90%
on behind closed doors.

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:04.577 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:09.215 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Right, and
I said okay, okay,

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.251 align:middle line:90%

in a private conversation
we had a couple of days ago

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:06.405 align:middle line:84%

in that room when he went

I mean I, I did not have
that for a while actually

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:29.028 align:middle line:84%
until I talked to the

and because the changes
started happening

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:40.306 align:middle line:84%
and there was obvious connection
between Gorbachev and Reagan,

00:25:40.306 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you saw it in the news and
they were laughing together,

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.411 align:middle line:90%

want to know any secrets

They were butting heads because
Gorbachev was telling Reagan how

00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:09.969 align:middle line:84%
to run American, Reagan
was telling Gorbachev how

to run Russia.

and headed for the door.

in Reagan's biography,

00:26:22.782 --> 00:26:27.887 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the stories, you
can pick that up, and he got up,

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:31.624 align:middle line:84%
headed for the door, before he
opened the door he turned around

00:26:31.624 --> 00:26:36.028 align:middle line:84%
and he had a big smile on his
face and he extended his hand

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.631 align:middle line:84%
to Gorbachev and said
my name is Ronnie.

the end result is laughter.

it's one way to monitor it

lot of times what's going on,

00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:15.334 align:middle line:84%

you know you're connected the

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:17.169 align:middle line:90%
right way.

that laughter has disappeared in

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:43.129 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Well I noticed that in
my marriage it was difficult

00:27:43.129 --> 00:27:49.735 align:middle line:84%
to admit that, however that
was, it happens very subtle.

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:53.472 align:middle line:84%
I just want people to know that
it doesn't happen overnight

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:57.977 align:middle line:84%
because normally what creates
laughter, and I believe

00:27:57.977 --> 00:28:02.915 align:middle line:84%
that strongly, it's the word
gift, g-i-f-t, which stands,

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:07.853 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, for give,
importance, fun and time.

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:10.289 align:middle line:90%
Give, importance, fun and time.

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:13.292 align:middle line:84%
So those, and I've been
researching because I went back

00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:16.595 align:middle line:84%
to college, got my master's
degree in Psychology,

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:19.632 align:middle line:84%
so I've been on this for the
last 12 years because I wanted

00:28:19.632 --> 00:28:23.702 align:middle line:84%
to dissect laughter, as a
performer, as a comedian

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:27.673 align:middle line:84%
who does this intentionally,
I do it every day

00:28:27.673 --> 00:28:33.245 align:middle line:84%
and I can be sick, I can be
tired or I might not want

00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:36.215 align:middle line:90%
to do it but yet I know how.

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:40.486 align:middle line:84%
I get on stage and I give
importance to my audience,

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:45.524 align:middle line:84%
I show up, I give them
fun, my sense of humor,

00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and I give them my time.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:90%
And that results in laughter.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:55.301 align:middle line:84%
However, in our personal
relationships, a lot of times

00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:58.737 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of the
relationship, we give that.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
That's how we get the girl,
that's how we get the guy,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.543 align:middle line:90%
and we say I do it then we don't

00:29:04.543 --> 00:29:07.713 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know what to do.

00:29:07.713 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, nobody clarifies
it for us that you need to give

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:15.955 align:middle line:84%
that importance, fun and
time if you want the result.

I remember when my
wife and I would just,

00:29:36.976 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:84%
we were in the honeymoon stage,
oh my goodness, we couldn't wait

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:45.017 align:middle line:84%
to see each other and then
we wouldn't want to leave.

00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:48.621 align:middle line:84%
So, and I was in another part
of the world and we would be

00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:51.624 align:middle line:84%
on the phone and it didn't
matter how much money it costed,

00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:54.793 align:middle line:84%
how much time, we would spend
hours giggling, laughing

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.763 align:middle line:84%
and then one of us would
say it's late, we need to go

00:29:57.763 --> 00:30:01.533 align:middle line:84%
to sleep and the other person
would, well you hang up first,

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.168 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no you hang up.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:03.936 align:middle line:90%

00:30:05.204 --> 00:30:08.107 align:middle line:84%
And a year later it would
be like you hang up first.

00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:09.808 align:middle line:90%
Hello? Hello?

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.509 align:middle line:90%

>> YS: Exactly.

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:17.583 align:middle line:84%
So all of that happens and
we get busy and it's normal

00:30:17.583 --> 00:30:23.222 align:middle line:84%
but laughter would be the
best, really the earliest sign,

00:30:23.222 --> 00:30:26.825 align:middle line:84%
if you are not hearing
laughter, pay attention

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:32.231 align:middle line:84%

of the sweetest sounds

It is the best, heart piercing
sound to hear the giggle

of a child or they're being
tickled and that belly laugh

has to do, if you're really,

audience, they can test this,

00:31:15.441 --> 00:31:19.611 align:middle line:84%
you cannot create laughter

>> YS: You can try all you want

00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:26.418 align:middle line:84%
but your brain knows it's you
giving that gift to yourself.

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not a gift.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.922 align:middle line:90%

else tickle you then

00:31:32.358 --> 00:31:33.325 align:middle line:90%
laughter happens.

because you know,

00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:56.248 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to figure this out.

00:31:56.248 --> 00:32:01.887 align:middle line:84%
Joy, feeling joyful
comes from within you

00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:07.393 align:middle line:84%
but happiness comes
from outside.

00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody can make you happy by
giving you a gift, importance,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.733 align:middle line:84%
fun and time, and laughter
would be result of that.

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:18.637 align:middle line:84%
So it takes another person
to actually give you a gift.

00:32:18.637 --> 00:32:21.306 align:middle line:84%
Gift, you can buy
yourself something nice

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.541 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a gift.

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:24.877 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to
give that to you.

00:32:24.877 --> 00:32:25.411 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:32:25.411 --> 00:32:26.545 align:middle line:90%

They could keep it and
it wouldn't be a gift.

You know you mentioned
this concept to me and I,

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:34.853 align:middle line:84%
and I went home and I looked
at-we were having a stressful

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:37.589 align:middle line:84%
night and a stressful
morning and I thought

00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:41.627 align:middle line:84%
about what you said and
I noticed the absence

in our conversations

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:48.333 align:middle line:84%
because it was time
crunch, I'd over scheduled

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.903 align:middle line:84%
and it was causing
stress in the household

00:32:50.903 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and what you just said
completely resonated with me

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.843 align:middle line:84%
at that moment and I
was, it was almost the,

00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.044 align:middle line:90%
it was the alarm clock.

00:32:59.044 --> 00:32:59.745 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yes.

00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:00.946 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: that went off.

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:02.948 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, what Yakov
said there's no laughter.

00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:03.916 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.084 align:middle line:90%
There's no connection.

00:33:05.084 --> 00:33:06.285 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yes.

00:33:06.285 --> 00:33:08.554 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We were not
connecting and we're all going

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:11.156 align:middle line:84%
in separate directions
and I thought about that.

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:13.725 align:middle line:84%
Now a week prior we
had great giggles

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.428 align:middle line:84%
and great fun time together
but in that moment, you know,

00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:19.565 align:middle line:84%
in the last maybe day
or so it was gone.

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:21.233 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: With a great
awareness though.

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:90%
I mean think about this,

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:84%
when the alarm goes
off you don't panic,

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.906 align:middle line:84%
you just go okay
time to wake up.

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:30.476 align:middle line:90%
What a great analogy.

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Time to wake up to what's
lacking, what's missing and then

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.918 align:middle line:84%
if you go to gift, g-i-f-t,
give, importance, fun and time.

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:43.922 align:middle line:84%
Now if you, a lot of times go
straight for laughter right?

00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:46.458 align:middle line:84%
They try to make the
other person laugh

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:52.264 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't work sometimes
because they're not getting-it's

00:33:52.264 --> 00:33:55.834 align:middle line:84%
like saying I want sex but I
don't want to give foreplay

00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
or I don't want to
spend time with you

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.505 align:middle line:84%
and I just want the
final result.

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:02.641 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work but if
you focus and say okay,

00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:05.144 align:middle line:84%
the alarm went off, how
can I give importance,

00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
fun and time then
it's by numbers.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
You can say I can
text that person.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:13.885 align:middle line:90%
I can plan dinner together.

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:19.658 align:middle line:84%
I can, and then laughter will
become a byproduct of that.

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:21.325 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That perfectly said.

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:23.128 align:middle line:90%
It's little tiny steps.

00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:24.463 align:middle line:90%
It's little tiny steps.

00:34:24.463 --> 00:34:25.964 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that alarm went off in
my head and I went oh gosh,

00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:28.901 align:middle line:84%
what we was talking about isn't
happening, but you're right,

00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:31.236 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be a
huge, monumental phone,

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.438 align:middle line:90%
conversation of this happened.

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:36.341 align:middle line:84%
It can be little things
that result in that.

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: I love that
analogy, alarm.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.278 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well you helped
me with that.

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.412 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: You're welcome.

00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:41.914 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So you do give
people these amazing,

00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:84%
you give people the gift of
laughter because you have,

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.385 align:middle line:84%
you're a brilliant comedian
and you have wonderful timing

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:52.524 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know you had
this much of a gift behind it,

00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:54.126 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to give
people an opportunity

00:34:54.126 --> 00:34:55.327 align:middle line:90%
to laugh for a second.

00:34:55.327 --> 00:34:57.129 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at Yakov in his,

00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:01.166 align:middle line:84%
this is your Branson
Missouri theatre show right?

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: It is but it's the
show that I did on Broadway

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:07.573 align:middle line:84%
and New York Times
gave it a great review

00:35:07.573 --> 00:35:10.542 align:middle line:84%
but it's the same show that I'm
doing now in Los Angeles yeah.

00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:13.045 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Watch the Gift of
Laughter from Yakov Smirnoff.

00:35:13.045 --> 00:35:14.046 align:middle line:90%

00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:07.292 align:middle line:84%
That just shows so much of
the transformational aspects

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:11.697 align:middle line:84%
of laughter and you make people
laugh for a living but it is,

00:37:11.697 --> 00:37:15.934 align:middle line:84%
it is innately what is in
every single relationship

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:19.571 align:middle line:90%
that we have is laughter.

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:21.707 align:middle line:84%
You spent some time
with a wonderful couple

00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:23.241 align:middle line:90%
that you learned a lot from.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.078 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:37:26.078 --> 00:37:27.446 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: They're amazing.

00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:84%
They, I actually saw them on
the Tonight Show with Jay Leno

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.188 align:middle line:84%
and they just celebrated
their 75th wedding anniversary

00:37:36.188 --> 00:37:39.825 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know anybody
who'd celebrate that kind

00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:42.461 align:middle line:84%
of anniversary so I
reached out to them

00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:48.533 align:middle line:84%
and they were very receptive and
I was doing a show, a talk show,

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:53.538 align:middle line:84%
in Branson and I invited them to
come to Branson and they agreed

00:37:53.538 --> 00:38:00.145 align:middle line:84%
to come, and we sent a limo to
pick them up from the airport

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:03.982 align:middle line:84%
and the driver was told
there would be a couple

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:90%
with their son.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.919 align:middle line:90%
So he brought a baby car seat.

00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:14.593 align:middle line:84%
He said how old is
the son, they said 70,

00:38:14.593 --> 00:38:17.496 align:middle line:90%
so we might need one soon.

00:38:17.496 --> 00:38:21.666 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, so they got there

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:25.237 align:middle line:84%
and when I saw them they were
giggling, they were laughing,

00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:27.339 align:middle line:84%
they were holding
hands and I said

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:28.807 align:middle line:90%
to them, what is your secret?

00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.909 align:middle line:84%
They said we're afraid
to fall down.

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:33.278 align:middle line:84%

holding hands to stay up.

Oaks California

I actually am going to
dinner with them tomorrow.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.458 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now what did
you learn from them?

00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:49.261 align:middle line:90%
What was the biggest take away?

00:38:49.261 --> 00:38:56.001 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: All of this what I
am sharing about the gift,

00:38:56.001 --> 00:39:01.706 align:middle line:84%
came from conversations with
them because of when I was,

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:06.144 align:middle line:84%
you know, I said to them
how, how did you get this?

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:10.882 align:middle line:84%
You sustained this
honeymoon for all these years

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:13.685 align:middle line:90%
and I said what made it?

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.454 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we
didn't understand this

00:39:15.454 --> 00:39:18.223 align:middle line:84%
because when we got
married it was scary,

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:19.524 align:middle line:90%
it was depression time.

00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:22.727 align:middle line:90%
We had no money, we were young

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:27.833 align:middle line:84%
and my husband wanted
me to be happy.

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:31.336 align:middle line:84%
He made a promise
and he said I know

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:33.538 align:middle line:84%
that you're happy
when you're laughing.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:37.342 align:middle line:90%
So he said, so he told me,

00:39:37.342 --> 00:39:40.579 align:middle line:84%
he said I knew what would
make her happy is a fur coat

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:43.081 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't have any
money so he said I went out

00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:44.816 align:middle line:90%
and bought her a mouse trap,

00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:48.787 align:middle line:84%
and the little card
said, it's a starter kit.

00:39:48.787 --> 00:39:49.921 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And she said they
didn't get the fur coat

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.025 align:middle line:84%
but I got something better,
I got the gift of laughter

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:55.327 align:middle line:90%
and it's lasted a lifetime.

00:39:55.327 --> 00:39:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Let's take a look at
this beautiful couple and,

00:39:58.864 --> 00:40:02.133 align:middle line:84%
and learn a little
something from them.

00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So you've spent a lot
of time with this couple

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:51.262 align:middle line:84%
and are you still
continuing to learn from them?

00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:54.933 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Oh yeah, oh yeah, every
time I see them I am amazed

00:43:54.933 --> 00:44:00.305 align:middle line:84%
because they just celebrated now
their 80th wedding anniversary

00:44:00.305 --> 00:44:07.779 align:middle line:84%
and it's just so heartwarming
to see how caring they are

00:44:07.779 --> 00:44:12.784 align:middle line:84%
and her health is getting
pretty, not so good anymore

00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and he's still driving,
he's still,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.289 align:middle line:84%
he just celebrated
his 100th birthday.

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:18.823 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What?

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:19.924 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yeah.

00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:24.929 align:middle line:84%
He did, on December
nine and he called me

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:26.731 align:middle line:90%
and he said Yakov we're going

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:29.634 align:middle line:84%
to be celebrating my 100th
birthday could you come be a

00:44:29.634 --> 00:44:30.835 align:middle line:90%
part of this?

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'd love to but
I have shows in Branson

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:37.208 align:middle line:84%
until December 9th so I
won't be able to make it,

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and he goes well we can
postpone the celebration.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.418 align:middle line:84%
I said if I was 100 I would
not postpone the celebration.

00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:49.387 align:middle line:84%
So, but they did postpone it,
I came and spent some time

00:44:49.387 --> 00:44:51.956 align:middle line:84%
with them and his daughter
was sharing with me

00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:53.858 align:middle line:84%
that she's nervous
that he's driving

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:56.327 align:middle line:90%
so she took away his car keys.

00:44:56.327 --> 00:44:58.797 align:middle line:84%

his new car.

everybody stayed together

but it was also survival
environment

where people teamed
together, not just them

but the whole family
to just find food,

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:90%
find shelter, all of that.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.908 align:middle line:90%

that place we become,

00:45:56.054 --> 00:45:57.589 align:middle line:90%
we're switching our mode.

00:45:57.589 --> 00:46:01.626 align:middle line:84%
Now we really need to
understand and give those gifts

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:04.496 align:middle line:84%
to one another to
be able to sustain.

00:46:04.496 --> 00:46:08.867 align:middle line:84%
If we don't meet, don't
give the gift laughter dies,

00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:14.005 align:middle line:84%
next goes sex, next goes the
whole intimacy and everything

00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:19.377 align:middle line:84%
and then because we have
luxury of affordable living,

00:46:19.377 --> 00:46:23.481 align:middle line:84%
people make money, they
say well why should I stay

00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:24.449 align:middle line:90%
with this person?

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:25.483 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Because it's
not fun anymore.

00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:27.218 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: It's not working anymore.

00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:31.422 align:middle line:84%
So I really very much
dedicate my life now

00:46:31.422 --> 00:46:35.393 align:middle line:84%
at this point recognizing
this formula and pattern,

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:39.731 align:middle line:84%
that if you give people
tools that actually can work

00:46:39.731 --> 00:46:43.968 align:middle line:84%
and can create that sexual
polarity and understand,

00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:46.404 align:middle line:84%
and that's what my
whole show is about,

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:49.707 align:middle line:84%
it's understanding the
natural gifts that we have

00:46:49.707 --> 00:46:54.012 align:middle line:84%
and getting humor from things
that don't, we don't have,

00:46:54.012 --> 00:46:58.149 align:middle line:84%
because man and women,
we're just different species

00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:00.118 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
humor comes from.

00:47:00.118 --> 00:47:05.256 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look at even just
laughter itself it's fascinating

00:47:05.256 --> 00:47:10.395 align:middle line:84%
because EHarmony.com,
they ask everybody,

00:47:10.395 --> 00:47:12.664 align:middle line:84%
they have over 10
million subscribers,

00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:14.933 align:middle line:84%
like what is the number
one quality you look

00:47:14.933 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in your partner?

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.237 align:middle line:84%
And the number one quality
by far is sense of humor.

00:47:19.237 --> 00:47:20.572 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh really?

00:47:20.572 --> 00:47:23.074 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Sense of humor way
bigger than financial security,

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:26.911 align:middle line:84%
education, anything,
even the looks.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Sense of humor, number one.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.585 align:middle line:84%
However as I was doing my
research for my master's degree,

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:37.021 align:middle line:84%
I realized that women
want somebody

00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:41.326 align:middle line:84%
who will make them laugh
and men want somebody

00:47:41.326 --> 00:47:43.695 align:middle line:90%
who will laugh at their jokes.

00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:46.898 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh well that's
a perfect combination.

00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:48.099 align:middle line:90%
Well you would think.

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: He doesn't want you
to laugh in the bedroom,

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:58.076 align:middle line:84%
like pointing and laughing
[multiple speakers] not good,

00:47:58.076 --> 00:48:01.512 align:middle line:90%
but when we, when men notice

00:48:01.512 --> 00:48:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that he made a woman laugh
we feel like super heroes.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:10.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean it just, it's
transformation and we can do

00:48:10.655 --> 00:48:11.956 align:middle line:90%
at that point anything.

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:14.892 align:middle line:90%
We can pick up our own socks

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:17.862 align:middle line:84%
from the bedroom
floor if women laugh.

00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:19.030 align:middle line:90%
See? So

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.965 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I need to
laugh more at home.

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Yes.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.736 align:middle line:84%
Woman laughter is
what men are after.

00:48:24.736 --> 00:48:28.473 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Good one, that's another
name of your show, the one,

00:48:28.473 --> 00:48:31.009 align:middle line:84%
the show that you're doing
now is Happily Ever Laughter.

00:48:31.009 --> 00:48:32.443 align:middle line:90%
It's all about that.

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:34.779 align:middle line:84%
Now your parents, we have a
good picture of them here.

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:36.114 align:middle line:90%
How long were they married?

00:48:36.114 --> 00:48:40.451 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yes, they were married
52 years and laughter was

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:43.721 align:middle line:84%
in abundance even
though life was not easy.

00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:46.758 align:middle line:84%
However, they knew
how to give the gifts.

00:48:46.758 --> 00:48:49.861 align:middle line:84%
My Dad knew how to
make my Mom laugh.

00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:52.463 align:middle line:84%
I mean it would be like, he
would say something to me

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:54.399 align:middle line:84%
like Yakov, do you
know why your Mother

00:48:54.399 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and I have a great relationship?

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Because when we got married
we made an agreement.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.772 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to run her life

00:49:00.772 --> 00:49:03.174 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to run my life.

00:49:03.174 --> 00:49:04.542 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: [Laughing]

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:06.944 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: My Mom would laugh and
she would forget everything.

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:09.847 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Did anything change
when they moved to America?

00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:11.682 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: A lot of things changed.

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:14.619 align:middle line:90%
Good changes for years.

00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:22.126 align:middle line:84%
It was that they, they
became so happy because added

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:26.431 align:middle line:84%
to everything was my success,
you know, and they lived

00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:30.401 align:middle line:84%
in L.A., I bought them
an apartment building

00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:32.537 align:middle line:84%
that they were managing
for years

00:49:32.537 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] was a
really [inaudible] place,

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of their environment
where they had tenants

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.146 align:middle line:84%
and they created
their little place

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:43.448 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Community.

00:49:43.448 --> 00:49:46.551 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yeah and my Dad was
proud, he was fixing thing,

00:49:46.551 --> 00:49:51.522 align:middle line:84%
he was, and Mom was taking
care of all the rents and all

00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:54.025 align:middle line:84%
of that stuff so they
were busy and happy

00:49:54.025 --> 00:49:57.428 align:middle line:84%
and that was joy
to me, you know.

00:49:57.428 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
When my Dad passed away
he made my Mom laugh

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.433 align:middle line:90%
until the last moments.

00:50:02.433 --> 00:50:10.708 align:middle line:84%
I remember, you know, he was
ill and he said to me Yakov,

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:15.580 align:middle line:84%
do you realize that
even now your Mother

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:20.118 align:middle line:84%
and I are intimate
almost every day.

00:50:20.118 --> 00:50:24.455 align:middle line:84%
Almost Monday, almost
Tuesday, almost Wednesday,

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and again my Mom would crack up

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:30.461 align:middle line:84%
and even though it was
sad everything was okay.

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:31.562 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And your Mom,

00:50:31.562 --> 00:50:33.564 align:middle line:84%
she developed a sense
of humor eventually?

00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:35.733 align:middle line:90%
She could dish it out.

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:38.903 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Mom had a
different sense of humor.

00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:40.304 align:middle line:90%
She did, she did.

00:50:40.304 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:84%
She did something that I will
never forget because it was,

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:50.148 align:middle line:84%
it was when she passed it was
difficult because she'd moved

00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:54.285 align:middle line:84%
to Branson and would come
to every one of my shows

00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:57.588 align:middle line:84%
and she would giggle and
she would sit near the stage

00:50:57.588 --> 00:51:01.626 align:middle line:84%
so I could hear her laugh
and it was music to my ears

00:51:01.626 --> 00:51:02.927 align:middle line:90%
because I could prolong

00:51:02.927 --> 00:51:05.696 align:middle line:84%
that what she was
missing with my Dad.

00:51:05.696 --> 00:51:13.504 align:middle line:84%
And then when she passed I was
closing up the apartment of hers

00:51:13.504 --> 00:51:20.178 align:middle line:84%
and I looked, the last thing
I had to look under the sink

00:51:20.178 --> 00:51:22.313 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was
anything there

00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and there was a package
there and it was wrapped

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:31.489 align:middle line:84%
in the brown paper from grocery
store bag and it was neatly tied

00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:35.593 align:middle line:84%
with the string and in my Mom's
handwriting it said "For Yakov"

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:41.365 align:middle line:84%
so I opened it and inside the
package was that old coffee can

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:46.304 align:middle line:84%
from years ago and inside the
coffee can was a little black

00:51:46.304 --> 00:51:48.372 align:middle line:84%
and white picture of
my Mom, my Dad and I

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:50.908 align:middle line:90%
on the day we left Russia.

00:51:50.908 --> 00:51:52.743 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little
note attached

00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:54.712 align:middle line:90%
and it was hard to reach in.

00:51:54.712 --> 00:51:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my God.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.783 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: The note was,
Yakov don't be sad.

00:51:58.783 --> 00:52:03.621 align:middle line:84%
Your Dad and I are together
now and we're probably laughing

00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:07.992 align:middle line:84%
and we love you very much
and it was just signed Mom

00:52:07.992 --> 00:52:13.998 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not ashamed to tell
you I was all choked up

00:52:13.998 --> 00:52:18.302 align:middle line:84%
and then I looked down from my
tears I see there's something

00:52:18.302 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:84%
else written on the piece
of paper and it said,

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.912 align:middle line:84%
P.S. By the way we're
out of coffee.

00:52:27.912 --> 00:52:29.347 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my God.

00:52:29.347 --> 00:52:32.783 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: That sad moment
I burst out laughing.

00:52:32.783 --> 00:52:35.486 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You laughing and she
left all of that for you.

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:37.588 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible moment.

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:39.724 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: But think about what
you and I talked about,

00:52:39.724 --> 00:52:43.961 align:middle line:84%
the connection even though
she wasn't here she left a

00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:47.898 align:middle line:84%
connection and the
laughter was a confirmation

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:48.933 align:middle line:90%
of that transformation.

00:52:48.933 --> 00:52:50.735 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of that transformation.

00:52:50.735 --> 00:52:53.004 align:middle line:90%
Still even after, wow.

00:52:53.004 --> 00:52:55.006 align:middle line:90%
What a story.

00:52:55.006 --> 00:52:58.509 align:middle line:90%
And so in your experiences

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:04.248 align:middle line:84%
and in your future relationships
what would you do different?

00:53:04.248 --> 00:53:08.986 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Pay attention
to the laughter first.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:12.456 align:middle line:84%
I mean because like
Raymond and Erma,

00:53:12.456 --> 00:53:17.128 align:middle line:90%
they are great examples of this.

00:53:17.128 --> 00:53:21.899 align:middle line:84%
He says, he said
here is what I do.

00:53:21.899 --> 00:53:23.701 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you tell her jokes?

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:28.306 align:middle line:84%
And he said no, he said no I
don't tell jokes but what I do,

00:53:28.306 --> 00:53:31.008 align:middle line:84%
I pay attention how
important she is to me

00:53:31.008 --> 00:53:34.845 align:middle line:84%
because the word important
comes from, he told me this,

00:53:34.845 --> 00:53:40.318 align:middle line:84%
from Greek work in port and the
items that were coming by boat

00:53:40.318 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:84%
across the ocean, they
were the most valuable,

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
the most expensive,
the more cherished

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:49.393 align:middle line:84%
and he said that's
how I treat her.

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:56.167 align:middle line:84%
And, and then I give her,
I create fun experiences

00:53:56.167 --> 00:54:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and I spend time with her and
then I listen for laughter.

00:54:00.705 --> 00:54:04.742 align:middle line:84%
You can't be more clear to what
this 100 year old guy says.

00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:06.444 align:middle line:90%
He said if you can get her

00:54:06.444 --> 00:54:10.348 align:middle line:84%
to laugh you can get
her to do anything.

00:54:10.348 --> 00:54:16.387 align:middle line:84%
Now this, this, this is
pretty impressive at that age.

00:54:16.387 --> 00:54:21.759 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying that's,
listen for laughter,

00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:23.894 align:middle line:90%
what you said you did yesterday.

00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:28.866 align:middle line:84%
You listened, it was an absence
of it and then you said ah,

00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:31.902 align:middle line:90%
a wakeup call, an alarm,

00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:36.207 align:middle line:84%
and then bring back
importance, fun and time.

00:54:36.207 --> 00:54:39.043 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that's, I've
got to go because I've got

00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:42.813 align:middle line:84%
to go call my husband
because [laughing] yeah.

00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Because yeah I'm just going
through in my mind that yeah.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.186 align:middle line:84%
I got stuck and the
laughter left.

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:50.254 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: And everybody does.

We're busy; we're busy
but pay attention.

>> LG: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Well I love how you say,

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.530 align:middle line:84%
when you reference America
you say we Americans

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.166 align:middle line:84%
and you did a beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful mural

00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:05.436 align:middle line:84%
that you're very well
known for after the fact.

00:55:05.436 --> 00:55:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It was anonymously done at the
time at the Ground Zero site

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:84%
of the 9-11 destruction and it's
really, it was really a gift

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:21.752 align:middle line:84%
by the way that you gave to
Americans and just it was

00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:24.789 align:middle line:84%
so heartfelt as well,
which is really the essence

00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:28.592 align:middle line:84%
of who you are, and I wanted
people to know that about you

00:55:28.592 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and know this side of you.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.763 align:middle line:84%
Yes he's a brilliant comedian,
yes he's had a great career

00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:37.835 align:middle line:84%
and yes he's an incredibly
connected, sensitive man.

00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:41.205 align:middle line:84%
Talking to you like you're
not here but take a look

00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:44.074 align:middle line:90%
at this, this beautiful mural.

[ Video Playing ]

00:59:17.154 --> 00:59:18.856 align:middle line:84%
That was a wonderful
contribution

00:59:18.856 --> 00:59:24.428 align:middle line:84%
that you gave there and, and it
really shows who you truly are.

00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:26.397 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that you
were an artist though.

00:59:26.397 --> 00:59:28.365 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:29.566 align:middle line:90%
>> YS: Thank you.

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:34.872 align:middle line:84%
I really, it was, it came
through me this mural.

00:59:34.872 --> 00:59:40.778 align:middle line:84%
I really, I painted it on
the night of the attack.

00:59:40.778 --> 00:59:47.051 align:middle line:84%
I spent a year trying to
get it up there and almost,

00:59:47.051 --> 00:59:51.555 align:middle line:84%
it was almost impossible in
those because security was

00:59:51.555 --> 00:59:53.891 align:middle line:90%
so high and all of that.

00:59:53.891 --> 00:59:59.596 align:middle line:84%
However the circumstance came
together and the people who own

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:03.133 align:middle line:84%
that building that was
damaged in the attack,

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:08.505 align:middle line:84%
the scaffolding had this white,
canvas looking thing and I,

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:11.308 align:middle line:84%
I just, when I saw it I
said it has to be up there,

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:12.843 align:middle line:90%
it has to be up there.

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:15.245 align:middle line:84%
So I approached them,
they live in Ohio,

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:19.683 align:middle line:84%
and they said we'll let you
put it up for ten days as long

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:23.220 align:middle line:84%
as you pay for everything
and get the right permits,

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.457 align:middle line:84%
and this was August and we
wanted it to be during September

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't, so I
went to union workers

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:36.433 align:middle line:84%
who were still union workers,
who were very upset with me

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:40.204 align:middle line:84%
in bringing this topic
up to them, and they came

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:45.242 align:middle line:84%
and they were, because they said
we used to take, carry bodies,

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:48.378 align:middle line:84%
dead bodies out of this crater
and we don't want to be here.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:54.752 align:middle line:84%
And I said, please
help me and they said,

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.920 align:middle line:90%
what do you want us to do?

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.925 align:middle line:84%
And I showed them the mockup of
this painting and they got quiet

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:04.328 align:middle line:90%
and then they passed it around,

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.631 align:middle line:84%
they stopped cussing
so which I knew

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:08.832 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It was a good sign.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.534 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: Yeah it was a good
sign and they said okay.

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.936 align:middle line:90%
And I said okay what?

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:14.705 align:middle line:90%
They said we'll do it.

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.473 align:middle line:90%
I said how much?

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you don't have
enough money to pay for it.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.846 align:middle line:90%
I said okay so then what?

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.481 align:middle line:90%
They said we'll do it anyway.

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:25.716 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh wow.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:30.687 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: And I said, I
said do I have permits?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:34.091 align:middle line:84%
And I showed them what I had
and they said no you don't,

01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:39.763 align:middle line:84%
and you will never get them
but we will do it anyway.

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:42.266 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Divinely guided,
my goodness wow.

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:43.467 align:middle line:90%
Mission, passion.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.703 align:middle line:84%
>> YS: I said why and the
leader of the union said

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:52.009 align:middle line:84%
because I want to, I want to
drive by with my son and I want

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:57.381 align:middle line:84%
to show him this
painting and I want to,

01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:01.051 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell him I helped
to put it up in the skies.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:04.788 align:middle line:90%
And here's the gift.

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:09.159 align:middle line:84%
I painted this but 50 union
workers came on Saturday,

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:15.199 align:middle line:84%
August 7th, September 7th,
five, five, four days before

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:20.604 align:middle line:84%
and they worked for 12 hours,
all of them, didn't get a penny

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:24.975 align:middle line:84%
for that and they put
it up and it was there

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:25.876 align:middle line:90%
for a year and a half.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.211 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my gosh.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.679 align:middle line:90%
What a gift.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:31.748 align:middle line:90%
What a gift and what a country.
