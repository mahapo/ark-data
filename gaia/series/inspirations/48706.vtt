00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We're broadcasting from
the Conscious Life Expo

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.070 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is an award-winning
research scientist,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Patrick Flanagan.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:84%
He began working with
the Pentagon at age 12.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And he is joining us to talk
about new pyramid energy

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:90%
discoveries and sacred geometry.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, thank you so
much for being here.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> DR. PATRICK FLANAGAN: Hi.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.179 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Hi.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: It's
great to be here, Lisa.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You have a great
booth downstairs with all sorts

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.646 align:middle line:84%
of incredible-- oh my
goodness-- energy systems.

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So I get to talk to
you all about that.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But let me back up a
second and talk about some

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of the discoveries that
you made that led you even

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
at 12 years old to
working with the Pentagon.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:90%
What started that?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:10%
>> FLANAGAN: I entered
a science fair.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:10%
My father was an oil
scout for Shell Oil,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:10%
and we moved every
six months when

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.487 align:middle line:10%
I was a kid, a new
town, new state.

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Every six months.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:10%
>> FLANAGAN: Every six months,
sometimes sooner than that.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And we lived in Montana,
and when I was 12

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:10%
we moved to Houston.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.885 align:middle line:84%
And I was in school,
and they said

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that there's a big
science fair coming up,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
all city, all grades, all
the way through college

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
all competing.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: And anyone who
wants to put in a science fair

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:90%
project to do so.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'd been working on a
atomic bomb intercontinental

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
ballistic missile detector.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I entered--

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: At 12.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: At 12, yeah.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.385 align:middle line:84%
And I entered it in
the science fair,

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and I won the
overall grand prize

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
for the entire fair, beating
everyone, all the college

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:90%
kids and everyone.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in study
hall the following Monday,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and the principal came
on the loudspeaker

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Will Patrick
Flanagan come to my office?

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.821 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon is
on the telephone."

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness, wait,
intercontinental ballistic

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.971 align:middle line:90%
missile seeker.

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: ICBM.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And what was the
technology that you found that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:90%
was so advanced?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:90%
What were you using?

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
What was the source?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.525 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well,
it was simple.

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a device that detected
the ionization of the gases

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.329 align:middle line:90%
when a missile is fired.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Through the air.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: It generates
essentially an ionized vertical

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
antenna of hyper superheated
gases that are generating radio

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
frequencies at all levels from
extremely low frequencies all

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
the way up.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And it transmits that
signal around the Earth.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.414 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The signals from that
trail go around the Earth

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
with less than 3 decibels of
loss, very, very little signal

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:90%
loss.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can locate it and
zero in on it with a direction

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
finder and locate
what's going on.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
with an atomic bomb,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:90%
they have different signatures.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I listened
in on the government

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
because they were doing a lot
of above-ground testing and ICBM

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:90%
missile firings.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I listed
everything and where

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
it occurred and so forth
in the science fair.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a call from a
general, a five-star general

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
at the Pentagon.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And they sent 15 scientists down
from Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.804 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: To investigate you?

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: To investigate me,
right, and they took it away,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
my invention away, and made my
father sign a piece of paper

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that said that if I talked to
anyone other than authorized

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
government representatives that
my parents would never see me

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my god.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%
What year was this?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh that was, what?

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 years old.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:90%
That would've been '56, 1956.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.517 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so
they took it away.

00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:26.808 align:middle line:84%
And you-- I mean you obviously
could have recreated it.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:27.664 align:middle line:90%
But you weren't--

00:04:27.664 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
No, they would call me
up, and write me letters,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and ask me questions in order
to perfect their own system.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: And so that caught
their attention very early.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So then did you
wind up working with them?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you wind up continuing
relationships with them?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, I
ended up doing consulting

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
for the Pentagon through
outside contractors.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
They use a lot of
think tanks that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
are outside the government.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The particular
think tank I worked

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
for was run by Dr.
William O. Davis, who

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
was former head of the
Office of Scientific

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Research at the Pentagon.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.912 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd go back east on
summers and work for them.

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: As a teenager.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Amazing, incredible,
and so is this technology still

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:90%
in play today?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.915 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: It's still the
best way to detect launching

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.857 align:middle line:84%
of missiles and atomic
bomb explosions.

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So obviously
you didn't stop there,

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.734 align:middle line:84%
and you went on to create other
inventions that created many

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
different US patents for
yourself, didn't you?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes, well, I
have over 300 inventions.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:90%
But I don't patent all of them.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
believe in patenting.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe in giving
the technology away.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I develop it first,
put it first to market,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and then people buy
my stuff because they

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:90%
know I invented it.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You don't run it back
through the government to get

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:90%
the patents?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: No, well, because
I've had two patents put under

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:84%
secrecy saying that it has
defense uses and I can't use it

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And so if I just put
it out on the market,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and with the guided
missile detector,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%
we tried to get compensation.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, it
wasn't on the market.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And since you
weren't selling it,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.755 align:middle line:84%
there's no value for
it, which is nonsense.

00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So your idea was taken.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You're a teenager,
and you just got

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
threatened and no compensation.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Right,
pre-teenager.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Pre-teenager, wow,
so how did that set you up

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
What difference did
that make in your life?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
What changed at
that moment for you?

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well,
when I was 17,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I invented a device called
the Neurophone when I was 13,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
which is a hearing device that
transmits information directly

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:90%
into the brain electronically.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And Life magazine came in
and did an article on me.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I was invited to San
Diego from Texas to a thing

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
called the Gold
Plate Award, which

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is an elite award
system that's given

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to very elite kinds of people.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And receiving the same award
with me when I went out

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
was Edward Teller, who invented
the atomic bomb, Admiral Red

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Rayburn, who was
director of the CIA,

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and he was also the inventor of
the Polaris nuclear submarine

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
system, and Murray
Gell-Mann, who

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
discovered the genetic
structure of viruses.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And all these people got
the same award as I did.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: So I was sitting at
a very elite table with a Navy

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.186 align:middle line:84%
honor guard and
things like that.

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: With your parents.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: No, just me.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:90%
My parents were there, but--

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, and
you were how old?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.233 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: I was 17.

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:18.292 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: 17, so this
system still exists today,

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
the Neurophone, is
that what it's called?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.708 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And is it
a hearing device,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or it goes somewhere
else on the body?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, it turns out
that it's not only a hearing

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
device, but it's a device
that causes phase coherence

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
of the left and right
hemispheres of the brain

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:90%
and increases IQ.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It increases blood
flow to the brain.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, the government

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
again has taken my idea and
is building ultrasonic brain

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
stimulators for fighter pilots
because when you're stimulating

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
the brain ultrasonically,
it increases IQ,

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
decreases reaction time, and
makes a person much sharper.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So why have you
never gone on to be a member

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.125 align:middle line:84%
of the government,
the CIA, the NSA,

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
any of these organizations?

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh, I was
offered-- Admiral Rayburn,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
when he was director of the CIA,
offered me a scholarship to go

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to any college in the
world, anywhere I wanted,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
as long as I wanted, and get
as many degrees as I wanted.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:90%
This was in the early '60s.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
would give me $165,000 a year

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
allowance and pay for the
college and all expenses.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That was just going to play
money back in the early '60s.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And by then, I was making
more money than my father

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:90%
as a consultant when I was 17.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I always
wanted to be James Bond.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But then I talked around to
some scientist friends of mine.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they said they'd pay for
all that, and all I had to do

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
was work for the CIA for
five years after I graduated,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and then I could be on my own.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But then some scientists
who I respected

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:84%
said they will never, ever
let you go if you do that.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I turned them down.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, well, I have
another proposition for you.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.895 align:middle line:90%
We can work on favors.

00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's that?

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, he said,
if anyone in government

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
gives you a problem,
you call up the CIA.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Leave a message for me,
and I'll call you back.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll solve
all your problems.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to do me a favor.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I called in a
few favors with him,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and he called in a
few favors with me.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And we remained friends.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
He went over and became head of
the National Security Agency.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you still provide
information on a scientific

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:90%
basis to them.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: I did.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You did.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.106 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Since he died, I
don't know if that system is

00:11:15.106 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
still in place,
although I hear it is.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So interesting, so
what an interesting life.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So now you, of
course, your ability

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.552 align:middle line:84%
to invent and create
things never stopped,

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's who you are.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.931 align:middle line:84%
And you went on to create
a microcluster technology

00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:90%
for water.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.037 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You moved into water.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Why water?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, water is the
most important nutrient we put

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And because it's so
ubiquitous, people

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:90%
think all water is the same.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I was working for the
Pentagon, Dr. Henri Coanda, who

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
was at that time the
world's foremost expert

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
on fluid dynamics and
gave me water research

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:90%
that he had worked for 60 years.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And he could predict by studying
the tap water or the water

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:84%
of any given city
in the world, he

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
could tell you the
average lifespan

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of the people living there
within five years just

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:90%
by analyzing the water.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave me all
his water research,

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.741 align:middle line:84%
and I created Crystal
Energy, which is--

00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's a product.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: --the
equivalent of Hunza water,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
because the Hunza people in
Hunza land north of Pakistan

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
are the longest-living
people in the world.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And their water has these
special characteristics,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%
which I duplicated.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So the characteristics
are increasing the surface

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:84%
tension of the
water, if I remember?

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Decreased surface
tension, increased viscosity,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and different freezing and
boiling points than ordinary

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the water
resembles the water

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that is already in the body
that surrounds the cells.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.497 align:middle line:84%
And we learned how
to duplicate that.

00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now these are just
drops that you put in water,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.017 align:middle line:84%
and it changes the
microclusters of the water.

00:13:13.017 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And now the work of
Dr. Gerald Pollack

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Washington
explains how it works.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I am so excited about his work.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.561 align:middle line:84%
He's made some major
water discoveries.

00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So can you take those
drops and put them in regular

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
tap water and change the
structure of the water?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.433 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You can.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah, it takes
any water and turns it

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:84%
into the best water
on Earth to drink.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And it allows
you to get more hydrated.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:90%
What is the benefit of the body?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: It
increases hydration,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and it also increases the
exchange of nutrients across

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:84%
cell membranes and toxins
being eliminated from the body.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Because metabolism generates
all kinds of toxins,

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
which need to be eliminated.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it increases the
efficiency of the cells.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because block toxins
and toxification usually leads

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
to major disease.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Right.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So we can release
the toxins from the body,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
open up the detox
pathways, fascinating.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.785 align:middle line:84%
So this is just another
one of the 300 inventions

00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:15.996 align:middle line:90%
that you've come up with.

00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Amazing, all right,
let's talk about your love

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:84%
for sacred geometry and what I
mentioned earlier in the show

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.371 align:middle line:84%
about the new pyramid
energy discoveries.

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get
into the anti-aging

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
to talk about here.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's start off with
the sacred geometry.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
What is your affinity
with sacred geometry?

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.604 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: When I
was nine years old,

00:14:36.604 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I read a book called The Frozen
Fountain by a man by the name

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of Claude Bragdon, who
was a famous architect.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
He designed the railway
station in Rochester, New York,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the most beautiful
railway stations on Earth.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And his whole book
was on sacred geometry

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and on the golden ratio
and how sacred geometry was

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
used to design temples
like the Acropolis,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and how it was used to design
the curves on Greek vases

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and also other sacred
temples throughout the world.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And he says that a tree
is a frozen fountain.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
you look at the tree,

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the way the limbs
come up and spread out

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
follows very precise
mathematical proportions

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
so that every leaf can
get its share of sunlight.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And so that--

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.143 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And it's perfectly
balanced so it doesn't fall.

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Perfectly
balanced, right.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The roots underneath
balance exactly the limbs

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
so that it's a perfect system.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all living systems,
our bodies are perfect systems.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're all based
on sacred geometry.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been my
passion all my life.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Pyramid in
Egypt and other pyramids,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
now they're discovering
pyramids everywhere

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:90%
in the world, underwater.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The remnants of Atlantis
and pyramids off of Okinawa

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and so
pyramids, the ancient world,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
people who knew how to build
megalithic sites that we

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even begin to build
today, even with everything

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.877 align:middle line:84%
we've got, were all
using sacred geometry.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: In order to build them.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Right, and
they were master masons.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:90%
They were master geometers.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And the whole universe
is constructed

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.317 align:middle line:84%
on these mathematical
principles.

00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: When you walk
through life or what you do

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, do you see
everything in those shapes

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and sizes and balance?

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: I do.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And many architects
design their buildings

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
based on sacred geometry, not
even being consciously aware

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.569 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:17:03.569 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It works.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Because when
you use that geometry,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:90%
everything is in balance.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything looks better.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's got a certain
energy feeling to it.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So when you're talking
about new pyramid energy,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
does this relate that energy
of the pyramid has a certain

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:90%
structure to it?

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes, golden ratio,
this Alexander Golod in Russia

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is an industrialist who
has spent over $500 million

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
building giant pyramids
all over Russia.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are scientific
papers published

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Russian language
about what these pyramids do.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
They deflect storms.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Like he built a big
pyramid in an area

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
where the worst storms
would come in and devastate

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:90%
villages and farms and so forth.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And ever since he
built that pyramid,

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:90%
there's not been a single storm.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
flowers are popping up out

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
of the ground thought
to be extinct for over 2

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:90%
million years.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
They only have them
in fossil records.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And now the live
flowers are growing.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Interesting, and
what do you attribute this to?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.674 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Energy.

00:18:19.674 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The dimensional
proportion of the triangle?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes, and in
fact the golden ratio.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
If-- there are
multiple dimensions

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and multiple
dimensional energies

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and what are now called torsion
fields, and their mathematics

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
all follow the golden ratio.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to tune
into multiple dimensions,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:90%
you use golden ratio

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because the golden ratio,
or divine proportion,

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is in divine perfect harmony
with all the universes.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so these pyramids
actually create energy fields

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:90%
that balance nature.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you've created,
and I saw down at your booth,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
several different structures
that are either hanging

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
or these pyramid shapes,
these three-dimensional out

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
of copper.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a copper rod?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: They're titanium
alloy, even better than copper.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why?

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Explain why.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, because the
titanium alloy has a very crisp

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
crystal structure
that's pyramidal.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the metal itself has
pyramidal crystal structures.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's very lightweight,
and you build these pyramids.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:90%
There are Nubian pyramids.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We have the Great Pyramid,
which is kind of flat compared

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to the Nubian.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The Nubian pyramids
are very steep.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're all based
on the divine proportion.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
They all actually are in
perfect harmony with each other.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And in Nubia long before
the Great Pyramid was built,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
they were building
these pyramids,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and they were storing
food in the pyramids

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and treating water
in the pyramids.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And they'd put ice
in the pyramids,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and they would act
like refrigerators

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
for all summer in the
hot African desert heat.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Wow, just because
of their alignment with

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
the geometric shape of the
atmosphere and the planets?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:90%
There was so much, probably.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Their structure
and somehow these people were

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
in tune with nature more so
than architects of today.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
had off-planet help,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, ancient aliens,
there's so much coming out now

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.267 align:middle line:90%
on ancient aliens.

00:20:39.267 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Absolutely.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: And having visited
the Earth and taught different

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:84%
people all over the
world mathematics.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we find
these same pyramid

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
shapes all over the
world, and they're

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.047 align:middle line:84%
discovering more
every single day.

00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You've talked a lot
about visiting these sacred

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
sites and going
and exploring this.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
What is one of your
favorite places?

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.894 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, Egypt is
one of my favorite places.

00:21:05.894 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: But where in Egypt?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh, everywhere
up and down the Nile.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I've been to all
the sacred temples

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
all the way from
the Mediterranean,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to the dam.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And all these
temples, if you look

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
at the rooms and the shapes
of the rooms in the temples,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
they're all based on
golden ratio mathematics.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And also all these temples are
designed for master initiations

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
of even Masonic kind of rituals.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Every single temple was
designed for a different kind

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:90%
of initiations.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
spiritual initiations.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Rites of passage.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Rites of
passage and different levels.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian religion was--
archaeologists look at it

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and make up things,
but there's more to it,

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
because these
people were masters

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:90%
at creating these temples.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And many of these temples
we couldn't make today.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:90%
It would be impossible.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
They had knowledge of rock
and possible levitation,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.565 align:middle line:84%
because there are stones--
In some of these temples,

00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:84%
there are stones that weigh 700
tons that have been moved miles

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and miles and miles and
then used in construction.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
equipment today that

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
could move stones like that.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So they really knew the
use of this particular type--

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:84%
this frequency, this
energy, this geometry,

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.622 align:middle line:90%
in order to utilize it.

00:22:56.622 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yep.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So I want to ask you
about the pyramids that you

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.646 align:middle line:84%
build again, the
three-dimensional ones made out

00:23:02.646 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:90%
of the titanium alloy.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
What use do you have
for market on those?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:90%
What do people do with them?

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: We have
meditation pyramids.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:90%
You can sit and meditate in it.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:90%
You can sleep in them.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You can treat food
and water in them.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And in Russia, they discovered
that if they put antibiotics

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in these pyramids and let
it stay for three days

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.110 align:middle line:84%
or so that the power
of the antibiotic

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:90%
was multiplied 2 million times.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
That is they could dilute the
antibiotic 2 million times,

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and it still would kill
bacteria as effectively

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:90%
as the original full strength.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But the diluted antibiotic
creates much less stress

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:90%
in the living system.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Right, right, so it
amplifies the power of food,

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Water, it
protects the environment.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I have people seriously talking
about building giant pyramids

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
in Oklahoma where the tornadoes
come down and wipe out towns,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:22.660 align:middle line:84%
because there is something
serious going on with these.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
discovering that, like I

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
say, popping up all over Earth,
under the ocean in the Bermuda

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Triangle--

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Are you consulting with
anyone on building these?

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: I am.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I have people.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote Pyramid Power
originally and published it

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:84%
in 1973, it caused a world
revolution in pyramids.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
People were building pyramids
all over the world, pyramid

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:90%
houses.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Triathletes were sleeping in
pyramids and getting results.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we got the
pyramid casino in Vegas now,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and we've got the pyramid,
that Great Pyramid in Memphis,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Tennessee, built
by Isaac Tigrett.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I mean they've just
popped up everywhere.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because of the
significance of them.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And usually these
pyramids, they're

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.856 align:middle line:84%
hollow inside so that you
can go in or place things.

00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh yeah.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Always.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Always, in fact,
they've never actually found

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:90%
a mummy in any pyramid.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Like Egyptians say, the
current Egyptian archaeologists

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
say that they were
temples for dead people,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:84%
but there's no indication
that they ever were.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were used for
initiations and for attempting

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to reach higher realms
of consciousness.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.855 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about
preserving queens and kings?

00:25:56.855 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Alan Landsberg did
a movie with me in the '70s.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the movie,
the whole contention

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
was that they treated the
pharaohs in the pyramids

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to preserve their DNA so that
they could come back and clone

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
them back into
life and so forth.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite a movie.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, it just
makes sense based on what

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.845 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:26:28.845 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the practical use of
these today and what you create

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:90%
is to--

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, I think
the practical use today is

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
as treatment chambers
for treating water.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it does change
water and plants.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Plants grow like
crazy in pyramids.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
There are people building
pyramid greenhouses,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and the plants grow like three,
four times larger, faster,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:90%
have more nutrients.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.752 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now, do you have
these all over where you live?

00:26:59.752 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
people in the area where

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I live that had pyramid
greenhouses growing things.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.715 align:middle line:84%
I have pyramids
all over my house.

00:27:08.715 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I have pyramids with
hammocks in them

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.456 align:middle line:84%
where you can sit and
swing and take a nap.

00:27:20.456 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Great.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the-- you had
mentioned about anti-aging,

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:84%
a revolutionary type of
anti-aging technique.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well,
there are a number.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in
anti-aging for years as a doctor

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and was the keynote speaker for
the International Anti-Aging

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Medical Association years ago.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are various
nutrients we can take now

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding out
increase, including

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
some of the nutrients
I've invented,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
to increase the production of
ATP-- Adenosine Triphosphate--

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and also to increase
cell division,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
increase the length
of telomeres.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yes, and early
on, we discovered that

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:84%
the antioxidant I invented
called MegaHydrate can increase

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:26.269 align:middle line:84%
the cell life by at least
four times and possibly more.

00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: If you put
it in just water,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
or if you put it in
creams, or what type of--

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: No,
if you drink it.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You put it in water and drink
it, or you feed it to animals

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:90%
and increases their lifespan.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
There are now indications that
also NAD-- Nicotine Adenine

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Dinucleotide-- NAD
is an enzyme, NADH

00:28:55.510 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that is a shuttle for electrons
in the mitochondrial system.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And studies at Harvard have
shown that mice given NAD

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:84%
lived over 2 and 1/2
times their lifespan.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And rats, there was a rat
that lived five years on it.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And they finally
had to kill the rat

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.074 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to do an
autopsy for their experiment.

00:29:22.074 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's the
only reason it died.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Because it had
lived 2 and 1/2 times its

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
normal life.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.324 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Are there any
side effects to these types

00:29:29.324 --> 00:29:29.823 align:middle line:90%
of things?

00:29:29.823 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: No.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: None.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.318 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: None that we can
tell other than you feel good

00:29:33.318 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and you're healthy.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm working on that.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that, living
in a balanced environment based

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:84%
on the divine ratio, that you
will increase your lifespan.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because you're
actually 100 years old, and--

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: No, I'm
70 years old this year.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how
long I'm going to live.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I had a really
rough start in life,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.205 align:middle line:84%
because I was severely
poisoned as a child

00:30:02.205 --> 00:30:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and had polio, was given
live polio vaccine.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What age?

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Eight
years old for the polio.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Two years old I
was given mercury

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
as a toy to play with when I
was two, and I became autistic

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and never said another
word till I was 5 and 1/2.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And my brother says it's because
I didn't have anything to say.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.025 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You mean to play with
because it swirled around and--

00:30:32.025 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah, back
then we didn't know--

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.997 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
how bad mercury was.

00:30:35.997 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I used to play with it.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh yeah, sure,
a lot of kids take it out

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of thermometers
and play with it.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.905 align:middle line:84%
But nobody got like
five pounds of mercury

00:30:46.905 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:90%
to play with like I did.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was drinking
it, and rubbing it

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.900 align:middle line:84%
all over my body trying to make
myself shine like a mirror,

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and rubbing it on copper
and copper pennies.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I played with
mercury for a long time.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
When I was 30 years old they
did a hair analysis of me,

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and the lab asked if the
patient was ambulatory.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor friend
who sent my hair

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:84%
in for analysis
said, why do you ask?

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your patient
has the highest level

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of mercury toxicity
ever measured

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:90%
in a human being in history.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was still alive.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I was a little strange
but still alive.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How did you
get the polio vaccine?

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Eight years old,
they gave live polio vaccine

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to children on the idea
that they'd get a mild case

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of polio.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.232 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go around and give
polio to everyone they met.

00:31:50.232 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: In order to
create the antibody?

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah, so that
people would be vaccinated who

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:90%
actually didn't get the vaccine.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But I had full on polio because
probably the mercury poisoning.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But I had full on
polio, and they

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:84%
said I'd never walk
again without crutches

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
or be in a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was determined that that
wasn't going to happen to me.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So I forced myself to
walk without braces

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and without crutches
in great pain,

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
overcoming and developed
muscles in my body

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and became a world-class
gymnast and just overcame it.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that your
desire to heal yourself

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why you
became a scientist?

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I was just in my lecture today,
I said a lot of my inventions

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:84%
were to heal me because
of the rough-- hard start

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I got in life.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Wow, what an
inspiration though,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and someone who's overcome
so much and turned what

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:84%
could've been debilitating
into something that was a giant

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.956 align:middle line:90%
blessing for so many.

00:33:03.956 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah, well
my whole life is blessed.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my wife, I'm
just a simple person,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:17.190 align:middle line:84%
but I happen to be a
channel of inventions.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.216 align:middle line:90%
And I act on them.

00:33:19.216 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
When the Information
comes in, I act on it.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And I work really hard.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is that I learn,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.460 align:middle line:84%
like I'm trying to create, let's
say an anti-gravity machine,

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working
really hard, and I

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.644 align:middle line:84%
learn everything
you shouldn't do.

00:33:37.644 --> 00:33:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: By trial and error?

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.393 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah,
and then I give up.

00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh my god, I give up.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll get a download
while I'm in the shower

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.730 align:middle line:84%
or driving down the
street, and it'll

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
be full circuits and full
technology and everything.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be like somebody up
there somewhere or inside felt

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.174 align:middle line:84%
sorry for me and gives me the
answers because I work so hard.

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's just
to end the suffering.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Right, just to
end the suffering, right.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What is one of your
most recent passions that

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.729 align:middle line:84%
you're creating right
now invention-wise?

00:34:12.729 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well,
it goes around.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I was nine
years old, I made a discovery.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I treated seeds
electronically, and the seeds

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.524 align:middle line:84%
grew incredibly well, and it
was an electrical treatment.

00:34:35.524 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How do you treat
them electronically?

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: With high voltage,
I did a high voltage like

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
a Tesla coil treatment on
these seeds when I was nine.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And I forgot about it.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, let's see,
60 years later, I

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:84%
remember that experiment I
did when I'm nine years old.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I go back, and I start
researching it again.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm making new discoveries.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, agriculture, the planet
needs food to feed everybody,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.707 align:middle line:90%
and GMOs aren't going to do it.

00:35:11.707 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So exactly
how'd you do that?

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:90%
You took a battery?

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Could you take a battery, or--

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: No, I used about
a 20,000 volt energy field

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and was treating seeds with it.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the seeds just
took off like crazy.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Would you put them
onto the coils or put the coils

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.375 align:middle line:90%
in the soil?

00:35:33.375 --> 00:35:34.010 align:middle line:90%
How would you--

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: No, you
plant them in the soil,

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:90%
and they start to germinate.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And you put a high-voltage
field over them.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.055 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to duplicate
the ionosphere voltage

00:35:47.055 --> 00:35:49.775 align:middle line:84%
field because between the
Earth and the ionosphere

00:35:49.775 --> 00:35:52.340 align:middle line:84%
you have a huge
electrical charge.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's where lightning
comes from when rain storms.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.654 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided to try
to duplicate nature,

00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and so I was-- but increase it.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
What if the ionosphere
had a billion volts

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:11.700 align:middle line:90%
instead of 300,000 volts?

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And so equivalent
of a billion volts,

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.789 align:middle line:84%
and I put that charge on
and made this discovery.

00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Jack and the beanstalk
right before your eyes.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh yeah, lo and
behold, and so I'm going,

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:90%
the world needs to eat.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But will it ever
reach the market?

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I just do these things
for the knowledge.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I've never done anything
actually to make money.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:45.436 align:middle line:84%
But usually when I make
something it's so good that--

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's a need
that needs to be filled.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Right.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Have you any knowledge
of the technologies that we are

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:84%
using today that you think
will solve some of the major

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.210 align:middle line:84%
problems of the world in terms
of energy and climate change?

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, there's
a lot being suppressed.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of inventions
have been suppressed,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
like those 300 mile
per gallon carburetors

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.660 align:middle line:90%
that we've heard about for cars.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.221 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: They really do exist.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: And
they got bought up.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's either, gee,
we'll buy that from you

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.370 align:middle line:90%
or we'll kill you.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And we'll take it.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you'll never
see your family again.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is that the world's

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
reaching a place where
it needs these things.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:10%
And when the need is
there, then those people

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:10%
who are making insane
profits on pollution that's

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.900 align:middle line:10%
going to destroy the world are
going to eventually lose out.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And so some of these energy
inventions will come out.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you can run
your car on water.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people
all over the world

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:90%
who are doing it.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:10%
When I invent
something, I discovered,

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:10%
like when I applied for
the Neurophone patent,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:10%
I discovered that there were
at least five other people who

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:10%
invented Neurophone
almost identical to mine

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:10%
at nearly the same time.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.730 align:middle line:10%
And I beat them all
to the patent office.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:10%
And so when some angelic
hierarchy or whatever wants it

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.450 align:middle line:10%
out, they give it
to a lot of people.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.067 align:middle line:90%
They don't depend on one person.

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That makes sense.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe
that's a good idea, too.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Yeah, so we
have cars running on water.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon our houses
will run on water.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.517 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's the idea of it
won't make it to mass market

00:38:36.517 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
because it does get sabotaged,
and there's a million different

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.470 align:middle line:84%
reasons why that we
can't possibly predict.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
you are here to show

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.459 align:middle line:84%
how easy that something
like this could be to do,

00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and if you connect the dots
and there's enough research

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.416 align:middle line:84%
out there and there's
enough underground

00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:54.570 align:middle line:84%
places to find this
type of information,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can create
it on your own.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Absolutely, if I
invented a free energy device,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I'd give it away to the world.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd blast it on
the internet free.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's been tried.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:90%
It's been tried.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Didn't get very far.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.797 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Well, then they
didn't have the right thing.

00:39:10.797 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Beause if they
really did have the right

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:90%
thing--

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: No, it was the right
thing, but it got squashed,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:90%
as you were saying.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh, we'll
have to talk about that.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen real
so-called free energy devices.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that
the people invented

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.960 align:middle line:84%
them were so greedy, you
know, I want $50 million

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
before I even let you look
inside under the hood.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And that never works
because it can go out,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and it can go out
without being squashed.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so
many people doing it

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.182 align:middle line:84%
now that the world needs
it and will have it.

00:39:57.182 --> 00:39:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: In the next 20 years,
do you think that we'll have

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.621 align:middle line:84%
that information
readily available to us?

00:40:01.621 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.703 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We'll be running
on cars that are run off

00:40:04.703 --> 00:40:05.870 align:middle line:90%
of energy, natural energy.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: I think in the
next five years we'll have it.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then
what about water?

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: We can create
water out of the air.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:24.480 align:middle line:90%
There's this Iranian physicist.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and there's another guy
who can take light and turn it

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.689 align:middle line:90%
into water.

00:40:30.689 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: And take light
and turn it into amino acids

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and proteins.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it all starts
with the photons.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything is light condensed.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
going on right now

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that is just begging to come
out and pushing to come out

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
like a baby getting
ready to be born.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Wow, well thank you so
much for shedding so much light

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.420 align:middle line:84%
on all of these-- you've
pretty much solved all

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.970 align:middle line:90%
the world's problems right here.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.958 align:middle line:84%
Energy, water, and
food, we're done.

00:41:07.958 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: My pleasure,
Lisa, thank you.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's such a pleasure to
talk with you and to give you--

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.970 align:middle line:84%
just to give you a bigger
platform so that more people

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
can understand that
you, sitting right here,

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:84%
have created all of these
solutions and that it is

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And you are brilliant
and an inspiration,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:90%
so thank you very much.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> FLANAGAN: Oh,
it's my pleasure.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mine, too.
