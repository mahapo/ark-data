00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Live big is the motto of my
guest today, Jack Canfield.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It's helped him stay
focused and inspired

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
after 144 publishers
turned him down

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
for the "Chicken Soup
For The Soul" series,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and it was also
the driving force

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
behind creating the Chicken
Soup For The Soul franchise

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that to date has sold over
500 million copies in print.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And it also qualifies Jack as
America's number one success

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
coach, which is what he talks
about in his latest book called

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
"The Success Principles"
that is actually

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in its 10th anniversary
revision which

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:84%
has a lot more wonderful,
powerful principles

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:90%
for success.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.789 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.788 align:middle line:84%
>>JACK CANFIELD: Thank
you for having me, Lisa.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm so excited to talk
with you because goal setting

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
for me has always been
something that I love doing,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and I set, and then
they disappear.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.884 align:middle line:84%
And then I get off
track on goal setting.

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Has this ever happened to the
people that you speak about?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.179 align:middle line:84%
Because you're such
an expert at this.

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well,
everyone approaches

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.761 align:middle line:90%
goal setting differently.

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me I set
21 goals every year.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have seven
areas of my life,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and I set three goals
in each of those areas.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And I usually get 17 of them
that year, and the other four

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
will happen within the
next 18 months or so.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I learned very early
on when I was in my 20s,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.907 align:middle line:90%
I had a guru-- not a guru.

00:01:33.907 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a business guru,
if you would call it that.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.935 align:middle line:84%
He was worth $600
million in 1968,

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
which would make him a
billionaire by today's

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:90%
inflationary standards.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: His name
was W. Clement Stone.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a really good
friend of Napoleon Hill who

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:90%
wrote "Think And Grow Rich."

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And Napoleon Hill once
said, "Of all the companies

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that ever used his principles,
W. Clement Stone's company

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
was the one that really
exemplified it the most."

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went to work for
him when I was in my early 20s,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
he taught me all
these principles,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:90%
and it really changed my life.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been using these
principles of goal setting,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
visualization, affirmation,
do it now, don't give up,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
all these kind of principles
that today everyone

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
kind of knows them, but most
people don't actually do them.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the trick is it's
not enough to know it.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep
yourself doing it?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's things
like mastermind groups,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
accountability partners,
coaches, mentors,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:90%
that keep you on track.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem with most
people, like you and like me,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.115 align:middle line:84%
is we're what we might
call solo entrepreneurs.

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a boss.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Solopreneurs.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.798 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: We don't have
a boss, so we're out there,

00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and our tendency is to
move toward the things

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that are habitual, or
comfortable, or easiest,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to have some way
to hold ourselves accountable.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has proven we
have areas where we're weak.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
If your leg's weak, you put
a cast on it if it's broken,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.399 align:middle line:84%
and so we need casts,
psychological casts.

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.065 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: support.

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Support
until we're strong enough

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to support ourselves in
those areas ourselves.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The challenge I find
is that I set this set of goals

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
but something else comes up
that's equally as magnificent,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and I say yes to that
which distracts me

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:90%
from the original goal list.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.312 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that the act of saying no?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Or is it choosing more
carefully saying yes?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: There's
nothing wrong

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with changing
direction midstream

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
if something more important or
actually better comes along.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is-- and I
doubt this is true for you,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
but I think for a lot of
people the distraction

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of the new thing
protects them from having

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to stay with the old thing
and actually get it done.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of time it
just is an excuse to not

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
hold ourselves
accountable to something.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But if someone came up
to me tomorrow and said

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.925 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you $10 million to do
this project that's something

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I've always kind of wanted to do
but didn't have the funds for,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was more
important than the project I

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
was doing, I'd
probably re-vector.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I find from
most people who are not

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
achieving their goals or
constantly switching around

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is that they either, one, their
goals were "should" goals.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.707 align:middle line:84%
And if you do a
goal out of should,

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
like I should lose
weight, I should do this,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I should spend more
time in the gym,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, then you're
not committed to it

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:90%
at the same level.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a goal to transform
education so I'm constantly

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.811 align:middle line:90%
focused on that.

00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not "should."

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.340 align:middle line:90%
It's "want to."

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
So when I have a goal of
something I want to do,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
like maybe the goal next
year will be go on a safari,

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
sure it happens.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.345 align:middle line:84%
But if I have a should
goal-- I find every year

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
most people get to
the end of the year,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have like five or six
goals they set that didn't do.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The next year, they set them
again, they didn't do them.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The next year, set
them, didn't do them.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Either that's a should goal,
or they don't know how, and is

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:90%
they can't figure it out.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Or they've got
little subconscious,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
limiting beliefs or
major fears around it.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Fear of rejection, fear of
loss, fear of looking foolish,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So then we can address the fears
and the psychological limiting

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
beliefs and get
those cleared up,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and then most
people move forward.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Unless again, it's something
you really don't want to do

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
but think you should have
done, so you put it down.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have to learn
that and choose carefully.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning when I talked
about those 144 publishers that

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
had turned you down, what kept
you going after 100, 101, 102?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.845 align:middle line:90%
I mean, most people would stop.

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, it'd be like
saying your kid's drowning out

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.741 align:middle line:84%
at sea, what made you keep
swimming 100 yards, 144 yards,

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
150 yards?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good analogy.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.415 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: You're
not there yet.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And for me, "Chicken
Soup For The Soul"

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:90%
became a divine obsession.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
say it any other way.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
came into my mind.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's something I became
totally obsessed with,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was because it
was meant to happen through me.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine
now talks about-- he

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "Success
3.0," Marc Gafni did,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about success
is allowing evolution

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
to occur through you, as you,
because we're the cutting

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:90%
edge of consciousness evolving.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Abe each of us has
a unique expression,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
something we need to
bring into the world.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
being rich or famous,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
although that might
be part of it,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.594 align:middle line:84%
but it's about maybe it's one
person has this music they

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
need to bring forward.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.593 align:middle line:84%
Someone else needs to
architect new buildings that

00:06:07.593 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
are ecologically sustainable.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Someone else needs to fix cars
or we'd all be in trouble,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.344 align:middle line:90%
and they love doing it.

00:06:13.344 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do that thing
that wants to come through us,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and that book wanted to
be birthed through me.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like once you start having
contractions, you can't stop.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.155 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't want
to do this anymore!

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:25.655 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Ultimately
we would have

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:90%
self-published if we had to.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really want
to be a publisher,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
but I would have done it if I
needed to to get the book out.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.135 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the
145th person said yes.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fortunately.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of evolution,
how have you

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
or your messages
evolved since then?

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
This was how long ago that
you started this franchise?

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.401 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: "Chicken Soup
For The Soul," the first book

00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
came out in 1993, so
we're beyond 20 years.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.672 align:middle line:84%
And so I think my
consciousness, and my work,

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and the book's, and
all that have evolved

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that-- well, first
of all, I have to tell you

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I no longer am
coauthoring all the books.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We sold the copyrights
and the brand and all that

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.235 align:middle line:84%
to another company
about five years ago.

00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was-- I
don't know if you've ever

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
had this experience.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Most people have.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You're doing something, you
love it, and all of a sudden

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.392 align:middle line:84%
it just doesn't do
it for you anymore.

00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Maybe you've done it.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.099 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So I knew I
needed to back away from it,

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and fortunately there was
a group in New York who

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:90%
really wanted to take it over.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And they had a better business
background, Harvard Business

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
School and all that,
and I'm much more

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.732 align:middle line:84%
psychology and
human development,

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
so they were able
to take the brand

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:90%
to places we never could have.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very good for
the whole Chicken Soup world.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.911 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the world now.

00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
franchise, Chicken Soup

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:90%
for The Indian Soul, in India.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.544 align:middle line:84%
There's about 20
books in that series

00:07:43.544 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that most people in
America never heard.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.521 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, right?

00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: So it's taken off.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It created a legacy
is really what you've done,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.291 align:middle line:84%
and so you've now moved
on into a different arena?

00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, what happened
when I left the Chicken Soup

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
thing was I had to
recreate myself,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and so everyone said you sold
almost half a billion books.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.951 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do that?

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was
going, well, I want

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
to be as successful as you.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:90%
You seem like it's easy for you.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, OK, I'm
going to take everything

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I know about success, and I'm
going to put it in one book.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And I sat in bed one morning.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I had 114 principles,
and my publisher said,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:90%
are you kidding me?

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
read 114 principles,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
so you got to narrow it down.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.393 align:middle line:90%
So we got it down to 64.

00:08:24.393 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But these principles--
and I interviewed

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
75 of the most successful
people in North America.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure
they we're just mine,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
but they were universal,
and it turns out they were.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I'm like
America's number one success

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
coach instead of the
Chicken Soup guy.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And my work now is
evolving into training w

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
because before the
Chicken w I was

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.708 align:middle line:84%
running these
self-development trainings,

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:50.851 align:middle line:90%
and really good at it.

00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the books took off,
and we put all the energy

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:90%
over there, and we sold that.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
I came back to trainings.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We've trained now 500
trainers in over 40 countries

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
to do my work, which is the
deep, experiential success

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
principle we call
Breakthrough To Success.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And now we've just
finished a video program

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:90%
where you could do it online.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
You can get certified
as a trainer

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.705 align:middle line:90%
by watching 40 hours of video.

00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you have to then run
a half-day and a 1-day workshop.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
You got to send us video
of that so that can certify

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.730 align:middle line:90%
you to make sure you do.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But we now have a goal to train
1 million people by the year

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:90%
2030.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Think big, Jack.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.276 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Think big, yeah.

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Live big, think big.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the number
one success principle?

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, let
me ask you a question.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
If you can only keep
one organ in your body,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.234 align:middle line:90%
which would you keep?

00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah!

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Exactly.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: See, there's
always this what's

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.811 align:middle line:90%
most important principle?

00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the silver bullet?

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.905 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't one because
it really is a system,

00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and I would say there's
about 25 things in the book.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
There's the first 25
principles that are a system.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can't make
a cake with only wheat,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
or only with eggs, are only
with yeast, or whatever.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a system,
and a system, I

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
define it as something that
always works as long as you

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
work the system the same way.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.675 align:middle line:84%
If you have a recipe for
your grandmother's apple pie,

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
if you always preset
the oven correctly,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
put in the right stuff,
don't use white sugar,

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
use brown sugar-- no today,
we'd use something else.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Agave.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.484 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not sugar.

00:10:22.484 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yeah.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.689 align:middle line:84%
But the point being that,
just real quick, you

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
have to be clear
about what you want.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to take 100%
responsibility for your life.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to create a
vision of what it is.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.749 align:middle line:90%
You have to break it into goals.

00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe it's
possible, not just for someone

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:90%
else, but for you.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to have
a plan, a strategy.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Now your strategy will
evolve and unfold,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
but yo have to at least
see the first few steps.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I use the metaphor
of at night, you

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.459 align:middle line:84%
don't need to see
the whole path,

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
you just need the next 200
yards, which your headlights

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
will illuminate.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But when you drive
that 200 yards,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
the next 200 yards shows up.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
what to do, go find

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
someone who's already done it.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I was in Texas getting my makeup
on before some morning TV show.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.375 align:middle line:84%
As I always do, I said
to the cosmetologist,

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:11.049 align:middle line:90%
I said what's your dream?

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, I want to
own my own salon someday.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's great.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.914 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
to make that happen?

00:11:15.914 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
She said, nothing.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.398 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's a
terrible strategy.

00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, why nothing?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.921 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I don't know what

00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:90%
to do to open my own salon.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let me tell
you a radical idea.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.862 align:middle line:84%
Go find someone
who owns a salon.

00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Ask them what they did.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.512 align:middle line:84%
She went, oh,
that's really good.

00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's my first step?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.428 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yeah.

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:36.424 align:middle line:84%
And so you got to take
what's the first step?

00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You got to surround
yourself with people

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that are positive so you have
a positive support group.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Get someone to hold
you accountable,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an
accountability partner.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Every morning you
and I would talk,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.136 align:middle line:84%
and say what are the five
things you're going to do today?

00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Practice the rule of five.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Do five things every day to
move you toward your core goal.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Then take action.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Respond to feedback, because
every action doesn't work.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Most people never
ask for feedback

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid of
what they're going to hear.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I ask my wife once a week, on
a scale of 1 to 10, how would

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
you rate our relationship?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.865 align:middle line:84%
I'm not always thrilled
with the answer.

00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's brave!

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Most
people don't ask.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the only one
who can improve it.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:84%
If I don't ask her, she's told
the women in the nail salon,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.165 align:middle line:90%
the line at Gelson's, whatever.

00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's right!

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So you got
to ask, and then you

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
got to respond to the
feedback, re-vector,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
change course, persevere,
and never give up, and then

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.352 align:middle line:90%
give thanks.

00:12:25.352 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
If you do those things in that
order-- and use affirmations

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.268 align:middle line:84%
and visualization, which I left
out there, right before you

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
take action-- that's
a system that works.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this is a 10
number combination lock,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and you only know eight numbers.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how many
times you reconfigure

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
those eight numbers,
it still won't

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
work cause you're missing two.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you need a formula.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.436 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: You need
a formula, yeah.

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
something very important.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You said about
taking responsibility

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.955 align:middle line:90%
for your goals or your actions.

00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, taking
responsibility for the results

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:90%
you produce.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.894 align:middle line:90%
You don't blame anyone else.

00:12:58.894 --> 00:12:59.685 align:middle line:90%
You don't complain.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:00.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's huge.

00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: 100%.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.849 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big one.

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
chapter in the book.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah-hah.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:84%
So taking responsibility for
even if you have failures

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
around it, there's usually some
reason where it might have been

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
a should instead of I would,
or something like that,

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.727 align:middle line:84%
but it's somewhere buried in
your limiting beliefs, right?

00:13:16.727 --> 00:13:17.434 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yeah.

00:13:17.434 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It's buried in your
limiting beliefs,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or it's buried in
the fact that you

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what you were doing
and you didn't study enough.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get
enough information.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:90%
You didn't respond to feedback.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.225 align:middle line:84%
You got defensive when
people gave it to you.

00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
You picked a bad location,
and nobody came, and then

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:90%
you wonder why?

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, you picked
the bad location

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
because it was
inexpensive instead

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of studying more,
getting more capital,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.301 align:middle line:90%
before you opened your store.

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of things.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.574 align:middle line:90%
And people blame the economy.

00:13:41.574 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know people
during the last recession

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.064 align:middle line:84%
who got really wealthy, so it
couldn't have been the economy.

00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We know people that
never get sick so it

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:90%
can't be the toxins in the air.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that we have
to take responsibility?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the hardest thing
I get when I do interviews,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
like on the radio
call-ins, well,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
you can't blame
me for my cancer.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wait a second.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.695 align:middle line:90%
Do you only eat organic food?

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you wear some
kind of EMF device?

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Which I have on right now.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.946 align:middle line:90%
Do you drink pure water?

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you drinking water
out of plastic bottles

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
that have BPA in it?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Have you detoxed at least
once every two months?

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you live next to
a cellphone tower?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Are you eating GMO?

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
You can go down the list.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you keeping
your body alkaline?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.659 align:middle line:84%
And people go no,
no, no, no, no.

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And then you're a victim?

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Taking responsibility.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
here at Jack talking about how

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
to goal set.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.857 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So why is it
so important to set goals?

00:14:36.857 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Because you want to be a winner.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.786 align:middle line:84%
You want to be one of the
people that gets what you want.

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
happens when you set goals is it

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
forces you to sit down and
clarify what you really want.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Most people never take
the time to really sit

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
down and intentionally
plan out their life.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They live a life of
reaction rather than

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
a life of creation,
a life of intention.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when you sit down
to think about, well,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to set goals,
what do I set them for,

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.482 align:middle line:84%
what do I set them
about, you have

00:15:02.482 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to have some sense of what you
want to create in your life.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
What's the ideal life that
I want to live look like?

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
What do I want in
terms of relationships?

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
What do I want in terms
of health and fitness?

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
How much money do I want to
be bringing into my life?

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
What impact do I want
to have in the world?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be taking
a look at all that.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing is to
sit down and take time.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to suggest
that once you stop watching

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
this video, you set aside at
least a half hour-- better

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
an hour-- and sit, and really
start to think about what do I

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%
want my life to look like?

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to experience?

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to do?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.247 align:middle line:84%
What I want to be, and
what do I want to have?

00:15:37.247 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at this
in any time frame at all.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, these
are my lifetime goals,

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
like I want to be in the
speaker's hall of fame,

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
or I want to win an
Olympic gold medal,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
or I want to retire with an
investment fund of $30 million

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
in my portfolio.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Those are long term goals.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But you also want to
have short term goals.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.743 align:middle line:84%
What you want to accomplish
in the next five years

00:15:56.743 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
and in the next year?

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And think a lot about what
do I want to accomplish?

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.554 align:middle line:84%
12 months from now, where do
I want to be experiencing?

00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If we were sitting here
a year from now saying

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:84%
what would have to
have happened for you

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
to feel really proud and
successful and pleased

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
with the success you've
made in that year.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at all those
different time frames,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
but sit down and ask yourself,
what do I want to experience?

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And one the things that I teach
people that's really powerful

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
is that you can really
look at all different areas

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
of your life, and we're
going to jump into that

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:90%
in just a few minutes.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
very valuable about goals

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
is they give you a sense
of potential, momentum,

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:90%
motivation.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They give you a sense of
direction in your life.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
really have any direction.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They're just responding
to what other people want,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
the demands they place
on them, and I always

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:84%
say that people that
don't have goals

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.237 align:middle line:90%
get used by people who do.

00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
People that don't have
goals work for other people

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:90%
that have them.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Jim Brown
once said something

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.499 align:middle line:84%
like, he said, "If
you don't have goals,

00:16:56.499 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be part
of other people's goals."

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.248 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
what they have in mind

00:17:00.248 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:90%
for you is not much.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be someone that's
saying, here's what I want,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.215 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go for it,
and created it, and have it

00:17:05.215 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Another reason that
setting goals is important,

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's really
the most important reason,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is that when you set
a goal, it requires

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
you to become something
bigger than you already

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:90%
are in order to achieve it.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It requires you to grow.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
My mentor, W. Clement Stone, who
I worked for back in the 1970s,

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
he said, "I want
you to set a goal

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
so big that it requires
you to stretch and become

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
someone worth becoming."

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And the point of that is
that it's not the goal,

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
because any goal you
achieve, whether it's

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.085 align:middle line:84%
the car, a house, your TV
show, a great reputation,

00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
a big portfolio, lots of money,
all that can be taken away.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Cars are stolen,
houses burn down,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes happen, Marriages
dissolve, fortunes are lost,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
but who you became in the
process of developing that can

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.232 align:middle line:90%
never be taken away from you.

00:17:53.232 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the payoff.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
It's called mastery
in life, and you

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
want to be putting
yourself out there

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and forcing yourself
to grow, to develop

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
new skills, new mindsets,
new relationships,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:90%
new competencies, et cetera.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the ultimate outcome

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.175 align:middle line:84%
because that will
always stay with you.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:90%
You can never learn less.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You can only learn more, and
we want to have you constantly

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
growing yourself, and goals
require you to do that.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want you, when
you set your goals,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.054 align:middle line:84%
to set goals that will
stretch you, not freeze you.

00:18:24.054 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
If they're too
big, you'll freeze.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It they're too small,
they're boring.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And if they're just at the right
level, you're going to grow.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you decide what to
write down as your goals?

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
We know they need to be
measurable and specific,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:90%
but what do I write down?

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to suggest three
quick techniques you can do.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
One is what we call an
irritation toleration list.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You walk through your house or
your apartment, your office,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
your car, your garage,
your factory, anything

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that you have dominion over,
and make a list of everything

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that isn't exactly the
way you want it to be.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
That door never closes
right, I can never

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
find a stapler when
I want it, I've

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
got this hole in
the screen door,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the pots I
need in my kitchen, whatever

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.322 align:middle line:90%
it might be, and make a list.

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And then what I'm
going to suggest you do

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
is that's what you don't want.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.125 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself what do I want?

00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times what
people focus on is what

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:90%
they don't want.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.173 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be a bad parent.

00:19:15.173 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have
my house foreclosed on.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to lose my car.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.981 align:middle line:84%
And now you're focusing
on the very thing

00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
you don't want is where
you're putting your attention.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.646 align:middle line:84%
We know from the
law of attraction

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that will actually get you
more of what you don't want.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's OK look at what
you don't want only long

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:84%
enough to say, OK, I want
the opposite of that.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Now that what you
know what you want,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to suggest
that a good way

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
to get started on that
is to take a weekend

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and just really blitz through
all those things and get them

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:90%
handled.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people when they
come and they listen to me

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.466 align:middle line:84%
talk like this, they
say, wait a second,

00:19:45.466 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a millionaire.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I want to have world peace.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.447 align:middle line:84%
I want to end hunger in
Pakistan, whatever it is,

00:19:50.447 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and you want to walk
through and worry

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
about I don't have a stapler
next to the Xerox machine?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
yes, and here's why.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
If you are sitting there
going, I can't even

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.999 align:middle line:84%
get the door to close
on my garage, what

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
makes me think I could create
peace in the Middle East?

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.689 align:middle line:84%
And so basically you've got
to start having successes

00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:07.730 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of these little
things getting handled

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in your life so it
gives you the confidence

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that you can handle
the big things.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it clears the
slate so that every time you

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
walk past a Xerox
machine, you're not going,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:90%
man, I wish we had a stapler.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't find this,
I can't find that.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to really
start focusing on the bigger

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.174 align:middle line:90%
things in your life.

00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
way to start getting

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:84%
clear about some
things you want.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I'm going to suggest
you make a list of 101 goals

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
achieve before you die.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.364 align:middle line:90%
101 goal list.

00:20:33.364 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
You may have seen the
movie "The Bucket List?"

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:84%
There's Morgan Freeman
and Jack Nicholson saying,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to die soon,
there's all these things

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to get to the
end of your life and all these,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.454 align:middle line:84%
well, someday I wish I had,
and not have done them.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
John Goddard, who I write
about in my first "Chicken

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Soup For The Soul"
book, at the age of 15

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
made a list of 126 goals
that he wanted to achieve.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I met him
he was in the 70s.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
He'd achieved 117
of those goals.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He'd been to the
Great Wall of China,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
gone to the Great
Pyramids, he'd gone down

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
the Nile River in
a boat, and he'd

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
done about everything anyone
could ever think to do.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But because he sets that list
and every year he reviewed it,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, what do
I want to do this year,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.575 align:middle line:90%
he led a magical life.

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about,
if we can, some of your goals,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
if you can, in this new,
not phase in your life,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:90%
but evolution of your life.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
What are some of your new goals?

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, we kind of
touched on a little bit of that

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.355 align:middle line:84%
before, to have a
million trainers by 2030.

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:32.474 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:32.474 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: This book's coming
out in its 10th anniversary

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.389 align:middle line:90%
edition.

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to see 500,000
copies sold this year.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a new book
coming out later

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.335 align:middle line:84%
this year called "The
30-Day Sobriety Solution,

00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
How To Get Sober Or Cut
Back Drinking In The Privacy

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Of Your Own Home."

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to see
300,000 of those get

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:90%
sold by the end of the year.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: And that's
a really good book.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with a guy
who's got an 85% success

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
rate in his coaching program
using most of my principles,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and some other things like
NLP and things like that.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.835 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why did you
write that book?

00:22:00.835 --> 00:22:01.785 align:middle line:90%
Just real quick.

00:22:01.785 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, I
met him at a retreat

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
here in Maui where
we're filming this.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
He came to my
retreat, and I learned

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
he was using a lot of my
principles in his program

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.347 align:middle line:84%
and getting great success, but
he had a somewhat small impact

00:22:14.347 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
in the world so far.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I said we got to get
this out to more people.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And with your
knowledgeable being

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
in that sobriety world--
and I've had several family

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.255 align:middle line:84%
members who are alcoholics
who are also sober now,

00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:27.949 align:middle line:84%
fortunately-- and my
reputation and ability

00:22:27.949 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to get books on in the
world, it would be a shame

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:90%
not to do this.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:90%
And so we decided to do it.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
beautiful process

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:90%
of putting this together.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
We actually beta tested the book
along with the website and all

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.370 align:middle line:84%
the coaching he was
doing, and everyone

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:90%
had major breakthroughs.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.307 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, what
happened, he was in AA,

00:22:47.307 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and AA's a great
thing, but they only

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.749 align:middle line:90%
have about a 20% success rate.

00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.248 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yeah.

00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
People that go and stay,
great, but most people go,

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.250 align:middle line:90%
they don't stay.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:90%
There's something missing there.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.162 align:middle line:84%
I've been to several AA
meetings with my kids,

00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always
sitting there going,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.078 align:middle line:84%
God, I want to run
an exercise now.

00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:05.755 align:middle line:84%
God, I'd love to
lead a meditation.

00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they can only deal with
that, that would solve that.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's missing.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.156 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Go to
the core of what

00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:84%
got them in there in the
first place, which is

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
there weren't alcohol deprived.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They were, like, needing to
self-medicate their pain,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
or they were afraid they
didn't have a purpose in life.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So he was going to AA
meetings, relapsed three times,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
listened to a Tony
Robbins tape, said,

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
why aren't they teaching
this stuff in rehab

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and in the recovery programs?

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So he started putting
that together,

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
ran across my book, started
applying a lot of that.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it came together.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And really now what we have is
the best of that whole recovery

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
world mixing together with the
best of the human potential

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness and
transformation movement,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
which has always
needed to happen.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:90%
And so now we get to do that.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Speaking
of transformation,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you have created the
Transformational Leadership

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Council, which is such a
heart-centered, beautiful

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
environment to be in,
and you've created

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
a field of amazing
leaders and people

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:90%
who lead movements in one space.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Have you always been this much
of a heart-centered person?

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that we've talked before
in an interview about a very

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
rocky childhood that
you had, growing up

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
on different sides
of the tracks,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and had to go through a lot of
learning at the very beginning.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Have you get evolved
in that way now

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.556 align:middle line:84%
to the ultimate of your lessons
just being about love, Jack?

00:24:29.556 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well,
the reality is that I

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
was a very cynical, shy,
somewhat judgmental person

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.954 align:middle line:84%
growing up, and I picked up from
my parents the way they lived.

00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And they hated big business.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.835 align:middle line:90%
They hated corporations.

00:24:42.835 --> 00:24:44.897 align:middle line:84%
So I became a
hippie in the '60s,

00:24:44.897 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and I hated all that stuff, too.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.124 align:middle line:84%
Very counter cultural, so
a lot of against energy.

00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the
things I was against needed

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
transformation, but
being against them

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to change it.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You need to come from love,
and understanding, compassion,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:90%
and then you can embrace.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of
years of psychotherapy,

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
meditation, Byron Katie's
work, Sedona Method work, EFT.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have probably done
everything from Arika to Zen,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:90%
A to Z.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Which has been great.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm still
growing, I'm still loving.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning to love.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I once said my autobiography,
if I ever write it,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.266 align:middle line:84%
is going to be called "Loving
To Learn, Learning To Love."

00:25:27.266 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why I
brought it up, yes.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I know you as a very
loving human being.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I watch you in the
exercises that your lead,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and they're so heart-centered.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I see the joy that
comes out of your eyes

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
when you see that type of
love connection in the room,

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and it just inspires me to see
what a heart-centered person

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I was wondering
how that comes

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
into play with what it is
that you do around goal

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.074 align:middle line:90%
setting, around your actions.

00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Your next steps, what
you set up for yourself.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, there's a
very important distinction

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
that I'll share with you.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
interviewed Michael Beckwith

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.996 align:middle line:84%
and if he's shared his four
steps of spiritual development

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
with you, but this was
really revelatory to me

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:90%
because I do teach goal setting.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Michael said there's four
stages of spiritual development.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.743 align:middle line:90%
The first stage is victim.

00:26:13.743 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:90%
God's doing it to me.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a victim.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
God, what did I do?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.726 align:middle line:90%
Why do I deserve this?

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Et cetera.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The second stage is where
you realize that you can

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:90%
work with God's universal laws.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So you learn things like
affirmations, goal setting,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:84%
visualization,
positive thinking,

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
how to meditate and intend
and all that, and it works.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And so you say, whoa.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people
get stuck there.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
There's another level,
which is to say, oh, my God,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
if there's universal
laws, there must

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
be something behind those laws.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to find out what that is.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And now instead of
working with God's laws,

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:84%
you realize, hey,
wait a second, I

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
want to be a channel for that
thing that's creating all this.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So now you stop saying my
will, and so you say, well,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:90%
what is thy will?

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:90%
I will do that.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So now you're tuning
in for guidance.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Internal guidance.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had always been
teaching goal setting should

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
come from tuning inside,
going to your higher self,

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
saying what is it
I'm here to do?

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:90%
What is my next step?

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:90%
What am I to manifest?

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Then you use the steps of
goal setting and affirmation.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:90%
There's a relation.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Because now it's not
coming from your ego.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.964 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
your higher self.

00:27:17.964 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not coming
from your bottom line,

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
your financial bottom line.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.524 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from a
totally different source.

00:27:23.524 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yes.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So everything I've done in the
last 30, 40 years of my life

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:90%
has been inner guidance.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to do "Chicken
Soup For The Soul."

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to the set up the
Transformational Leadership

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Council.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to set up a
training program for trainers.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from
Iran two weeks ago,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and Iran is considered
an enemy of America.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I go over there,
and I've been there twice,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
the people are just like us.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They feel their
government's hijacked

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
them the way our
government's kind of been

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:90%
hijacked by certain elements.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And they love the west.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.529 align:middle line:90%
They love us.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere I
go, I realize people

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.329 align:middle line:90%
want to love and be loved.

00:27:57.329 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:90%
They want to make a difference.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:90%
They want to feel important.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's in
China, or whether it's

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
in Texas, or whether
it's in South Africa,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:90%
we're all the same.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get that, it's
pretty easy to love everybody.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.954 align:middle line:84%
Someone once said-- they
put their hand up like this,

00:28:12.954 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and said, so which of these
fingers am I going to cut off?

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:90%
If that's all you can see.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.321 align:middle line:84%
And you realize if you go like
this, they're all connected.

00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good!

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So basically,
if we're harming anyone,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:90%
we're harming ourself.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And It's easy to say those
words and read them in a book,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:84%
but when you eventually
get it is really true,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.265 align:middle line:90%
then it's transformative.

00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.975 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you
don't judge anybody.

00:28:34.975 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't seclude anybody.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's absolutely true.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So in this new-- not
new evolution, but

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
as you have grown to
now talking about love

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and bringing love into goals,
can you tell us your practice,

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
your way of getting
these downloads,

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:53.895 align:middle line:90%
these divine messages?

00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:54.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.359 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: I would
lie to say I meditated

00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
every day, because if
I get up at 4 o'clock

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to catch a plane somewhere,
I probably won't that day,

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
but certainly four to five
days a week I will meditate.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I go inside, and
I've got three or four

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.094 align:middle line:84%
different meditations
I do, and I never

00:29:07.094 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
know which one I'm going to
do until I start breathing.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But they all open
me up to receive,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to just pay attention to
what wants to come through.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes I get words.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I get feelings.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I see pictures.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I get nothing, but
then the next day something

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
will happen that I feel
attracted to it, which came

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:90%
from that being quiet space.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so each day, it's
kind like, OK, what now?

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.644 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra has a
wonderful meditation

00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:37.560 align:middle line:90%
he does every morning.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
He says something to
the effect of please

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
help me to be of greater
value to more people.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that is, I'll do it.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of do that
after I heard he did that.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought that's pretty cool.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And how can I reach more people
and give them more support,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.590 align:middle line:84%
create less suffering,
more joy, more abundance.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you still have
the monkey mind chatter

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that most of us have when
you start that process?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: I would
say yes, but less.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I've started to
notice-- I'm 70 now,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and I've been meditating
for a lot of years,

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's more quiet
than there used to be.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:90%
There really is.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience about
two years ago working

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
with a shaman, and he said, I'm
going to take you to a place.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.225 align:middle line:84%
You want to come back, but you
have to promise me you will,

00:30:23.225 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:84%
because if you won't
make that promise,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I won't take you there.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience
of pure bliss.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I thought I knew what bliss was.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:90%
We talk about it easily.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, oneness,
no separation.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.506 align:middle line:90%
There was no observer.

00:30:36.506 --> 00:30:37.880 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
to be observed.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It was just oneness.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.107 align:middle line:84%
And even that
doesn't sound right.

00:30:41.107 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I came
out, my wife was there.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, all you did was cry
for 20 minutes after that,

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.076 align:middle line:84%
and you just kept saying, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:90%
And I could have died.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really didn't
want to come back,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:90%
but I made the promise.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:84%
My wife was waiting
for me, so I did.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But from that moment, somehow
there's more quiet in my mind.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like I don't
sit in there and go, jeez,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I got to do so and so.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.376 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
he take you there?

00:31:04.376 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: He took me there
with a substance, actually.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.672 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:31:07.672 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Called ayahuasca.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, ayahuasca.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.105 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: It's
from the rainforest.

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:10.667 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:10.667 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: And I'm
not a big druggie.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it in the '60s.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.146 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've talked
about it before on Gaiam.

00:31:15.146 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: And I just
decided to do that.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I've done it once before
in the rainforest,

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.835 align:middle line:90%
and it was profound.

00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:25.335 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally I'm not the
same person I was before that.

00:31:25.335 --> 00:31:27.168 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can we talk
about that for a second?

00:31:27.168 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a near
death experience

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.470 align:middle line:90%
where I visited that place.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.725 align:middle line:84%
If it's a state or a
place, I don't know.

00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's another
dimension, I don't really

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:90%
think that matters.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But I went to that pure,
expanded, vast, no separation

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:84%
place of consciousness, and I
seek to find that all the time.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.926 align:middle line:90%
I think it exists here.

00:31:48.926 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Oh,
it does, it does.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Here right now.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Do we need a near death,
falling off a bike that I did,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:90%
or a substance to get there?

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we tap in?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:90%
What is that ego or whatever?

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.823 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Well, it's our mind.

00:32:02.823 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Our mind basically is
afraid, and our ego's

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
afraid of dissolving
into that oneness

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:84%
because then it
doesn't exist anymore.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's like a drop of water
in the ocean is the ocean,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
it's just not the whole ocean,
any more than I'm all of God,

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:90%
but I am God.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to Michael's
concept for a moment,

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.060 align:middle line:84%
it was like, OK,
God's doing it to me.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Now I can do it with God,
and I'm going to channel God.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth stage of
consciousness, I am God.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Not all of God.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not an arrogant place.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's called, oh,
that's what we all are.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I find
that, then imagine

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.970 align:middle line:90%
what my consciousness is.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So my experience always has been
that we have these mountaintop

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
experiences, like
whether it's a meditation

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
or it's through some
kind of psychotropic,

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and then we go, oh,
that's possible.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
That really is there.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.123 align:middle line:84%
Then we come back, and
there's still bills to pay,

00:32:54.123 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and the dog poops on the
carpet, and the bill collector's

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.040 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.985 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sucks us back
down to this dimension.

00:32:58.985 --> 00:33:01.194 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: But if you
go in there every day

00:33:01.194 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
practice, whether it's

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.172 align:middle line:84%
meditation, or Tai Chi,
or walking on the ocean,

00:33:05.172 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
everyone has their own
way of getting in there.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Some is physical, some visual,
some auditory, chanting,

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I will share this
one little thing.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.950 align:middle line:84%
When I was in this
experience with the shaman,

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I just was there,
and all of a sudden

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:90%
it was this explosion of light.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you know how they
call it the voice of God

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.806 align:middle line:90%
at a conference?

00:33:23.806 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Robin Williams."

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I
heard this voice go,

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.859 align:middle line:84%
"You are about to experience
what very few people on Earth

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:35.775 align:middle line:90%
will ever experience."

00:33:35.775 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And it went--

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, oh, my God.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And it really is, oh, my God.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is, because
God is that whole entire space.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's so vast.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's so vast.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, I went to Asia.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I was in California in the
bottom of a mountain, fallen,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.759 align:middle line:90%
and I went to Asia in my mind.

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Sounds like
a John Denver song.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.914 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Went to
Asia in my mind.

00:34:08.914 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly!

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough,
fast forward 15 years later.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Asia with it
dear, dear friend

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:90%
who tried to die on the beach.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I held his hand
during that moment,

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was in Asia
that that happened,

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and I watched him transition
out and in that space.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%
And the soul knew.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:90%
My soul knew that.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
We watched Scarlett Lewis talk
the other day about her son,

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
Jesse, whose life was taken
in the Sandy Hook tragedy,

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:84%
and he had all of these
precognitive drawings

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:84%
of this killer that he
had drawn before he died.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.542 align:middle line:90%
That how the soul knows.

00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I know this is an interview
about goal setting, Jack,

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:84%
but I want to ask you
how does the soul know?

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Your soul knows.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, I'll tell
you an interesting story.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.633 align:middle line:84%
When I was in college
I had a roommate

00:35:11.633 --> 00:35:14.530 align:middle line:84%
whose father was very eccentric,
and every 10 years, he

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.102 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book.

00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:84%
He'd study for 10
years and write a book.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.476 align:middle line:84%
He'd written a book
on the Piri Reis map

00:35:18.476 --> 00:35:21.532 align:middle line:84%
which they found predated
any exploration like Columbus

00:35:21.532 --> 00:35:22.490 align:middle line:90%
or any of those people.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
He spent 10 years
trying to figure out

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.270 align:middle line:84%
who was it that came over here
and drew the inland waterways

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of America and all that?

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:84%
When he died, he was working on
a book called "My First Million

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Years," and he
was having himself

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.987 align:middle line:90%
hypnotically age regressed.

00:35:35.987 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
He went all the way
back to coming out

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean as an amphibian
with pure memory of that.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was in
hypnotic age regression,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
they bring you back
by saying you're

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.674 align:middle line:84%
coming forward in
time and space,

00:35:45.674 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
coming forward in time space.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:90%
He went into the future.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was at the airport, and
he read the headline on a paper

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that said something
about an air crash

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was three
days into the future.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And three days
later, that happened.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Now in order for
that, you either--

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
what he ended up believing
after all of his research

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
is that all time is
happening simultaneously.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The future, the present, and
the past all exist right now.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So just the way you
can go into the past,

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:90%
you can also go into the future.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
going out there.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like layers of this all
happening at the same time,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and you just tune into that.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.840 align:middle line:90%
That's my theory, anyway.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I liked the way he
explained it best.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
kind of goals are

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.587 align:middle line:84%
is it's setting into the
future what can happen.

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:31.295 align:middle line:84%
And if you align
yourself with meditation

00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:33.503 align:middle line:84%
and you're taught consciousness
practices that you're

00:36:33.503 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
talking about, you can
actually align yourself

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.364 align:middle line:84%
with it actually manifesting,
with it actually happening.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, something
one of the speakers here

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.780 align:middle line:84%
at this conference we're
attending where we're filming

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:84%
this said the other day is that
basically the more you can free

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:84%
up the energy in your body and
contain more energy-- this is

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the big problems with
"The Secret" is lot of people

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
say, well, I did all that
stuff, but nothing's happening.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's either a
limiting belief, or a fear,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
or some anger, or
some energy that's

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:84%
not of love manifestation
that's blocking that.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so all the
techniques, if you

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough of
the openness, that's

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:84%
why the work on belief's, the
work on overcoming your fears,

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
releasing, all the technologies
that exist now to do that

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:90%
are so important.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And so many people are pushing,
pushing, pushing, pushing.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I find as you
open up this space,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.860 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
your drawn forward.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You're pulled into
it instead of trying

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.447 align:middle line:90%
to wedge your way into it.

00:37:30.447 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That just
answered my next question,

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
is what about the worries
that come up in all of that?

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you let that
go, then you're

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.650 align:middle line:84%
sucked into the field,
like you're talking about,

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:90%
which is so fascinating.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.835 align:middle line:90%
That's so great.

00:37:41.835 --> 00:37:42.980 align:middle line:90%
That's so good.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
here at Jack talking about what

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to do at the first of the
year, but you could do this

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:90%
at any first in your life.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Take a look

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Because we
now know from research

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that the simple act
of writing a goal down

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.277 align:middle line:84%
increases your chances
of achieving it by 55%.

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:84%
This is research done at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And we know if you write
it down and you read it

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:84%
just a couple times
throughout the year,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:90%
it increases your chances 100%.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.875 align:middle line:84%
And if you read it every
week and review it,

00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
we know that it
increases your chances.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.744 align:middle line:84%
You're getting 200% more
than the regular people.

00:38:16.744 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
That's how many goals
you're going to achieve.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.680 align:middle line:90%
So writing it down is critical.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.711 align:middle line:90%
So make that list, and be brave.

00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Just put down things you want.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.793 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about how
it's going to show up.

00:38:25.793 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that a little later.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.229 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
I'm going to recommend

00:38:29.229 --> 00:38:31.334 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
vision exercise,

00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:84%
to look at your life--
and we divide your life

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:90%
into seven areas.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:90%
There's relationships.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:90%
There's finance and money.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:90%
There's your job and career.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.190 align:middle line:90%
There's health and fitness.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:90%
There's fun and recreation.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:84%
There's what we call
personal, which is just things

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to own, things
I want to do just

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:90%
for the sake of doing them.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:84%
This includes your spiritual
goals, your emotional goals,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:90%
your educational goals.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.999 align:middle line:90%
And lastly, contribution.

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
What difference do you
want to make in the world?

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
What legacy do
you want to leave?

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
at each of those areas

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and say one year from
now what would have

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I liked to have accomplished
in that area of my life,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and then say, OK, that's a goal
I'm going to set for myself,

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:90%
now you've got seven goals.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Now for some people, seven
goals may be too many.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
say, well, that's more

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:90%
than I want to take on.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm going to prioritize
and pick three or four.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:18.564 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you to
overwhelm yourself.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
want a balanced life

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and a very fulfilling life in
all areas, so you're healthy,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:84%
you're happy, and
you're successful,

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.475 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a great
energy and your body,

00:39:30.475 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
out there and making

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.641 align:middle line:84%
a difference in the
world, and you're

00:39:33.641 --> 00:39:35.461 align:middle line:84%
growing your financial
world, you're

00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:90%
going to have a great balance.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.001 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to look at
all those areas of your life,

00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and then think
about specifically

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.174 align:middle line:84%
what's one thing I
want to accomplish

00:39:43.174 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:90%
in every one of those areas.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.165 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you're going
to have a really great year,

00:39:48.165 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have a head
start in setting your goals.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at some of the
common traps and pitfalls

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that people fall
into that stop them

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.760 align:middle line:84%
from setting goals
correctly and also

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:90%
from achieving their goals.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Number one is what we
call unrealistic goals.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:84%
People say, OK, I want
to do something that's

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:84%
totally impossible for
them, but they just

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.332 align:middle line:84%
got it out of someplace like
the cultural norms they see.

00:40:09.332 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to
be a millionaire.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have people
in our seminars

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.089 align:middle line:84%
that are making $35,000
a year, and we'll

00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:84%
say what's your financial
goal for the next year?

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.421 align:middle line:90%
And they go, a million dollars.

00:40:18.421 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
What about people
making $500,000 a year?

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.068 align:middle line:90%
What's your goal?

00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:90%
A million dollars.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
external cultural norm

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that says, oh, a
million dollars,

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really necessarily
relevant to your situation.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the concepts
that we teach

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.017 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
four levels that you

00:40:33.017 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:90%
can be setting goals from.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.259 align:middle line:84%
The first is called
repair and recovery.

00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:38.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting there,
and you've just come out

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of bankruptcy, or
you've lost your job,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:84%
or you have no foundation
meaning you don't have

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.950 align:middle line:84%
any kind of infrastructure
to start a business with,

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:84%
no assets, nothing
you can invest with,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
making a million dollars in
one year, it's not impossible,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's not likely.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to say
what would be a next step

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:84%
up for me to get me
from repair and recovery

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to what we call foundation?

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I first
started my company.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a typewriter.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I had one phone in my house.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I can remember we had like
literally five splitters

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.754 align:middle line:84%
taking phones off to
five phones a year later

00:41:10.754 --> 00:41:12.795 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have
enough money at that point

00:41:12.795 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:84%
to even go out and
rent an office space.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have to build
up this infrastructure

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.705 align:middle line:90%
and then create this foundation.

00:41:19.705 --> 00:41:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Are you coming
from a foundation?

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.109 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the basics?

00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you have an education?

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the skills you need?

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the competencies?

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.752 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the relationships,
the network, whatever.

00:41:29.752 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And then once you have
that, you can move

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:90%
into place we call abundance.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
have any abundance.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:90%
No abundance of time.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:90%
No abundance of friends.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:90%
No abundance of network.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:90%
No abundance of opportunities.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.256 align:middle line:84%
But in my life, I have
an abundance of all that.

00:41:43.256 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
you get to a level

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.004 align:middle line:84%
where you can set
goals from that

00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:90%
where I can build huge dreams.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We can set up offices in
25 cities around the world.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.190 align:middle line:84%
We can invest in all
kinds of programs,

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and projects, and
workshops to develop.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The last stage is
called mastery.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to get to
mastery, but you

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.712 align:middle line:84%
can't go from repair
and recovery to mastery.

00:42:04.712 --> 00:42:06.170 align:middle line:84%
If you just got
out of the hospital

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and you had cancer
surgery, you're

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:84%
not going to be
running a 100 yard

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:84%
dash in nine seconds or a
26 mile marathon next month.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And so your goals
need to be relevant

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
based on where you start from.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So really sit back and
say, OK, is this a goal

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:90%
that's believable for me?

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you
want to look at,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.870 align:middle line:90%
is this something I really want?

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of our goals
are created out of shoulds.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I should lose weight.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I should exercise more.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I should eat more healthy.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I should do this
thing with my family.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not
something you want to do,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.919 align:middle line:84%
it's going to show up year
after year on your goal sheet,

00:42:41.919 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be one
that you never get done.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And why don't you get it done?

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.959 align:middle line:84%
Because deep down, it doesn't
have any juice for you.

00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no passion.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:90%
There's no excitement about it.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The things that really make
you go, wow, I want that!

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What we heard there
was about combining, really,

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:84%
the goals and what we're talking
about here, the consciousness

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and the goals.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
That personal development
and self-development worlds

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.737 align:middle line:84%
have really
combined, I believe--

00:43:08.737 --> 00:43:11.070 align:middle line:84%
business development and
self-development, I should say,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:90%
have really combined.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And you bring that
about in your book,

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and you wrote that a while ago.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.606 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the new
information in the book.

00:43:19.606 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, what I'm
most excited about in the 10th

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.985 align:middle line:84%
anniversary revised edition--
that's a lot of words--

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of the success principles--

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.693 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In other
words, for new stuff.

00:43:27.693 --> 00:43:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yes, very good.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.524 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 new
pages in this book.

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:84%
This book actually has more
pages than the last one.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.150 align:middle line:84%
We found a thinner stock paper
that actually works really

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So it's
still very good.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We've added 100 new pages
of chapter on leadership

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:84%
called It's called Lead So
People Will Want To Follow.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.715 align:middle line:84%
We did a chapter on networking
with Dr. Ivan Misner

00:43:45.715 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:84%
who started BNI, Business
Network International.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a guy named
Moses Ma who's a tech genius.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We did for new
principles on how to be

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:84%
successful in the
digital age, things

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.915 align:middle line:84%
about crowd sourcing,
crowd funding, how

00:43:57.915 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:84%
do you brand yourself in
social media and all of that.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But the most exciting
part of the book, I think,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.700 align:middle line:84%
is we handled a lot of
questions that came up.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I did this Ask Jack
Calls for years.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.991 align:middle line:84%
People said, well, I
don't understand this.

00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.170 align:middle line:90%
So we handled all of that.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.275 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the stories
in there are now Illustrated--

00:44:14.275 --> 00:44:15.650 align:middle line:84%
or the principles
are illustrated

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.810 align:middle line:84%
by people who have actually
read the first book,

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
applied the principles,
and had amazing successes.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the Donald
Trumps of the world

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.140 align:middle line:90%
or the Olympic athletes.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's real, just
everyday folks who've

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.650 align:middle line:84%
done extraordinary things so
it's much more believable.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
If you read about
Donald Trump, you

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.069 align:middle line:90%
go, ah, but he's Donald Trump.

00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.762 align:middle line:90%
He's different.

00:44:31.762 --> 00:44:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But you read about
a single mom who

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.837 align:middle line:84%
started a company or a person
who had a brain injury,

00:44:35.837 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as he got that-- he
was hit in the side of the car

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.644 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't walk, and yet using
visualization and affirmations,

00:44:41.644 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
as she learned
from this book, was

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
able to walk down the
aisle for her wedding just

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.370 align:middle line:90%
a few months later.

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
All the doctors saying that's
impossible, you can't do it.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But my favorite story,
I'm in Manila teaching

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.269 align:middle line:84%
in the Philippines,
and this guy comes up

00:44:54.269 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to interview me the
night before when

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I was doing a book signing.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the interview, I

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.409 align:middle line:84%
said that is one of the best
interviews I've ever had.

00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Almost as good as Lisa.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.697 align:middle line:84%
So I said, how long
you been doing this?

00:45:04.697 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, this
is my first interview.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.917 align:middle line:90%
I said, get out of here.

00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:09.625 align:middle line:84%
And he'd just been
hired by the newspaper

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
to interview successful
people about success,

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.190 align:middle line:90%
and he had just lost his job.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:84%
He'd owned a restaurant that
bankrupted because of fighting

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:90%
between the partners.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.980 align:middle line:90%
His girlfriend left him.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.936 align:middle line:90%
He was couch surfing.

00:45:19.936 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:90%
He had no money and no car.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:90%
A friend dropped him off.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, how much
money do you have?

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:90%
He says, $3.80.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my total net worth.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.677 align:middle line:90%
So I have him $20 to buy dinner.

00:45:28.677 --> 00:45:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I had to buy a book
from the bookstore

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
to give it to him because
I didn't have any.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Manila, right?

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I come back to
Manila two years later

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to do a one-day
seminar, and in walks

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
John wearing gold Doc Marten
shoes, beautiful blue blazer,

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and a big logo on in gold on
it, and then 10 guys behind him

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:84%
all with polo shirts
with the same logo.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you're the
guy that interviewed me.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:90%
You look different.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, I am now the number
one motivational speaker

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.520 align:middle line:90%
in the Philippines.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I have two cars, a house, a
beach house, a radio show,

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.830 align:middle line:90%
a TV show.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.349 align:middle line:90%
I am getting a million a year.

00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What!

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: I've got audiences
of 600 to 1,000 people.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, John, what the heck?

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do that?

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, you gave me your book.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.769 align:middle line:90%
You were successful.

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Here you are, millions
of books sold,

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.100 align:middle line:84%
multimillionaire, happy
life, good health, all this.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.805 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that
guy's successful.

00:46:17.805 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not I'm going
to do everything

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:90%
he says in that book.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Every single chapter, I'm going
to do everything for one year.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.268 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
work, I've lost a year.

00:46:25.268 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If it does work, I want to
be as successful as him.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.051 align:middle line:84%
So he did it,
every single thing.

00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anyone else who's
ever done every single thing.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it was his Bible.

00:46:32.716 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: It was his Bible.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I have story after story
like that in there of people.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did, Forrest Willett

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:90%
is lying in bed in Toronto.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.191 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a TV interview,
and they say, right

00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:90%
after this news we'll be back.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Jack Canfield is going
to talk about how

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.773 align:middle line:84%
to get from where you are
to where you want to be.

00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Now he's got brain damage
from an automobile accident,

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.266 align:middle line:84%
has not been out of bed for
two years, totally depressed.

00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Just lies in bed like this.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.246 align:middle line:84%
He heard that, I want
to get from where

00:46:57.246 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I am to where I want to be.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.046 align:middle line:84%
Got his wife to
buy him the book.

00:47:01.046 --> 00:47:02.420 align:middle line:84%
He was reading at
the third grade

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:90%
level because of brain damage.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
He taught himself to read
just to read this book.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.097 align:middle line:84%
He is now a super
successful businessman.

00:47:09.097 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Took my training,
the Trainer program,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.385 align:middle line:84%
is giving speeches
all over the country.

if it wasn't for this book.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So I am only optimistic about
it because I know it works.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:23.312 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need another
dollar, but what I do need

00:47:23.312 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:84%
is for the world to work, and
that's why I keep doing this.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those stories

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:27.680 align:middle line:90%

That's beautiful.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And what a wonderful feeling
that must be for you,

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to make that much of an impact
on even one person's life,

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
let alone the 500 million
that have all been impacted

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:90%
by the Chicken Soup world.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:90%

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.890 align:middle line:90%

I am happy as heck
everywhere I go.

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was
in Iran, they told me

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.960 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret" had been shown on
national Iranian television six

00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.770 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.404 align:middle line:84%

My goodness.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, you do teach people how
to bring about their own dreams

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
through publishing their own
books and how to self-publish.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You have a great
piece on that here.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.876 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at this video, Jack

00:48:16.876 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:84%
talking about all of you
self-publishers out there.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.396 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:23.955 align:middle line:90%

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Here's a person who
just sent me a magazine article

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.560 align:middle line:84%
in the mail today, and she's
reading one of our books

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:90%
in the magazine.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:90%
There's the picture of the book.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.065 align:middle line:90%
I love my work.

00:48:51.065 --> 00:48:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, everyone has to
start with their first book,

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.641 align:middle line:90%
and it's a challenge.

00:48:57.641 --> 00:48:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I thought
about writing my first book,

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, my God, it seems
like such a huge thing to do.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I had just finished being a high
school teacher back in Chicago.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.551 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching in
an inner city school

00:49:07.551 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:84%
where I realized
my students weren't

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.051 align:middle line:90%
that motivated to learn.

00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:11.675 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
excited about history,

00:49:11.675 --> 00:49:12.930 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't seem to be.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought, well,
maybe I'm not a great teacher.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to realize
that they didn't believe

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.670 align:middle line:84%
they could learn, so
I started studying

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.410 align:middle line:90%
this area called self-esteem.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
How do you raise kids'
belief in themselves?

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And I started
taking workshops, I

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:84%
read all the books I
could get my hands on,

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:31.277 align:middle line:84%
but I never found the
book that I wanted to buy.

00:49:31.277 --> 00:49:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And someone once said to
me, one of my professors,

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.609 align:middle line:84%
if you can't find the book
you're looking for, it must

00:49:35.609 --> 00:49:36.960 align:middle line:90%
be you're supposed to write it.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
well, maybe I am.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down, and I
wrote a book on "100 Ways

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
To Enhance Self-esteem
In The Classroom."

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And that book, which
was a book for teachers,

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:90%
went on to sell 400,000 copies.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:90%
And?

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Literally just it absolutely
changed my career.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.209 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anything
simple about writing a book.

00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:04.875 align:middle line:84%
You got to deal with
a lot of obstacles.

00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:06.416 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you're
taking time away

00:50:06.416 --> 00:50:09.370 align:middle line:84%
from your family, your
wife, your children.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
There's the self-doubt
you have to confront.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't tell
you how many times I

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.311 align:middle line:84%
sit there going like, does
this really read well?

00:50:16.311 --> 00:50:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone really going
to care about this?

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.194 align:middle line:90%
Am I wasting my time?

00:50:20.194 --> 00:50:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Often you're taking time
away from your health

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:23.943 align:middle line:84%
because you're sitting
there for long hours.

00:50:23.943 --> 00:50:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I can remember
many times starting

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to write at 7:00 at night,
and the next thing I knew,

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:90%
the birds were singing.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
The sun was coming up.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.670 align:middle line:90%
But I had such a passion.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get
this message out.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just whatever it
took, I was going to do it.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.271 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.271 --> 00:50:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So with "Chicken
Soup For The Soul,"

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
which is probably my greatest
achievement in my life,

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that came about very
surreptitiously.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I was giving talks,
and I was illustrating

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.944 align:middle line:84%
all of my seminars and
my workshops and talks

00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:51.860 align:middle line:84%
with stories, because I
know that stories help

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.990 align:middle line:90%
people to remember the concept.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
stories in my talks.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I was at Boston coming
home on a plane,

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.532 align:middle line:84%
and someone had just
asked me that they day,

00:51:02.532 --> 00:51:03.990 align:middle line:84%
they said that
story about a puppy.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that in the book anywhere?

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.178 align:middle line:90%
My daughter needs to read it.

00:51:06.178 --> 00:51:08.770 align:middle line:84%
A week earlier, someone said
the story about the Girl Scout.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that in the book anywhere?

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:90%
My daughter needs to read it.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I started writing down
what are the stories I know?

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And came up with like
71, something like that.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.934 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, there's
enough for a book.

00:51:18.934 --> 00:51:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Once you've written
a book, and it

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.125 align:middle line:84%
could take anywhere from six
months to a year write it,

00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:24.125 align:middle line:90%
then you got to sell it.

00:51:24.125 --> 00:51:25.852 align:middle line:84%
And with "Chicken
Soup For The Soul,"

00:51:25.852 --> 00:51:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of a
classic story now,

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but we were rejected over
the course of a year and more

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:90%
by 144 publishers.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They said people don't
read short stories.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:36.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a stupid title.

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:37.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not sexy.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not edgy.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we'd given up after 100,
I'd not be sitting here today.

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's led now to 225 books
with over 500 million copies

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.340 align:middle line:84%
sold in 47 languages
around the world.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.176 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely changed my life.

00:51:54.176 --> 00:51:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I've met some of the
most amazing people.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.994 align:middle line:84%
I've had lunch at
the White House.

00:51:57.994 --> 00:51:58.910 align:middle line:90%
I've met Bill Clinton.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:90%
I've met George Bush.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.155 align:middle line:84%
I've met the king of
several countries.

00:52:03.155 --> 00:52:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I've met the presidents
of countries.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I met the guys who
started Google.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's given me an ability
to influence, to get

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:84%
into government, to make
a difference in politics,

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.727 align:middle line:90%
to have a lot of things.

00:52:14.727 --> 00:52:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing it does--

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and those are all wonderful
perks, prestige, and power,

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:24.045 align:middle line:84%
and profits, and the big P's--
but the real big one is impact

00:52:24.045 --> 00:52:25.110 align:middle line:90%
in other people's lives.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:37.573 align:middle line:84%
What I have here, these are just
letters and cards thanking me

00:52:37.573 --> 00:52:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for everything from
books I've written

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.320 align:middle line:90%
to seminars I've created.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Here's one from China.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I get letters, and
emails, and presents,

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and books other
people have written,

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and bottles of wine every
single day, saying you

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.110 align:middle line:90%
changed my life.

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think about, wow, my
book impacted that life.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And literally thousands and
thousands of stories of people

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.180 align:middle line:84%
who've started businesses,
written their books.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And to know that thousands
of people around the world

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:84%
have better lives because
of what I chose to write,

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.331 align:middle line:90%
that's the payoff.

00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So at this stage of my career,
what I've decided to do

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.610 align:middle line:84%
is to really focus
a lot of my energy

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
on helping other authors get
their message out and become

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.380 align:middle line:90%
bestselling authors as well.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.000 align:middle line:84%
As I thought about
that, I said, well,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.160 align:middle line:84%
who do I know that's been in
my career that's helped me?

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of my co-author
friends, some of my friends

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.140 align:middle line:84%
who are celebrity authors,
some of the people

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that helped me like
Steve Harrison.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:84%
When we started "Chicken
soup For The Soul,"

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.150 align:middle line:84%
we reached out to
Steve and said, hey,

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.240 align:middle line:84%
can you help us get
this book out there?

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And he quantum leaped
our success very quickly.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, Steve, would you
be willing to team up with me,

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and let's create a
training program that can

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:90%
help authors get there faster?

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVE HARRISON:
Most people who

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.680 align:middle line:84%
want to succeed as authors
don't realize there really

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is a marketing game, and there
are proven strategies you

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:59.050 align:middle line:84%
can use to get more publicity
and sell a lot of books.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And Jack and I have
really enjoyed teaming up

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to really share the best
seller blueprint with aspiring

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.015 align:middle line:90%
authors.

00:54:07.015 --> 00:54:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD:
Everybody has a book,

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
memoir, or a cookbook,

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.570 align:middle line:84%
or a book about how you were
successful as a teacher,

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:90%
a real estate agent.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it might
be, there's something

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.065 align:middle line:84%
you have to share with the
world that's uniquely yours.

00:54:19.065 --> 00:54:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And here's the deal.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.620 align:middle line:90%
You just have to start.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:25.157 align:middle line:84%
You sit down, and
you write one page,

00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:26.740 align:middle line:84%
then you write a
second page, and then

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.160 align:middle line:90%
you write a third page.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Now it's easy to say that.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:32.400 align:middle line:84%
There's some skills that
are useful to do that.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.474 align:middle line:90%
We can teach you how to do that.

00:54:34.474 --> 00:54:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We can give you the
confidence to do it.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:84%
We can give you the
skills to do it.

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We can give you the
support to keep doing it

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:84%
until you get it done,
and then teach you

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.070 align:middle line:84%
how to get the book out there
so people actually read it.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.289 align:middle line:84%
And you, my friend,
have a huge impact

00:54:46.289 --> 00:54:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in the world that's
going to give you

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.005 align:middle line:84%
a sense of meaning
and fulfillment

00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:50.593 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
even imagine today.

00:54:50.593 --> 00:54:53.251 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've
impacted someone's life.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They decide they want to write
their story like my friend who

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.490 align:middle line:84%
had that accident on
the beach and went

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in and out of those lives.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:84%
He could write
that story, right?

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yeah.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:04.978 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How would he do that?

00:55:04.978 --> 00:55:07.567 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Well, the writing
of it there's, a lot of ways.

00:55:07.567 --> 00:55:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you can
just sit down the write.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you can have
someone interview you,

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.660 align:middle line:84%
because often we don't know what
we know until someone asks us.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.400 align:middle line:84%
You could record
it into a recorder

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and have someone in Sri
Lanka or fiverr.com,

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.130 align:middle line:90%
whatever, type it for you.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.900 align:middle line:84%
My wife's writing an episodic
memoir right now by doing that.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of her life?

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Of her life.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With you?

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: No, just
of her own life.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Not with me.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm part if it,
but from childhood.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The key thing is once you get--
I always recommend people just

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.619 align:middle line:90%
sit down and outline it first.

00:55:36.619 --> 00:55:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Dot points, whatever
you want to say.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you can speak into that
and put more my words on it.

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:42.435 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing
is-- and this is

00:55:42.435 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:84%
what made "Chicken
Soup" so successful--

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.510 align:middle line:84%
get at least 10 other people to
read it and give you feedback.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Literally, page by page,
chapter by chapter, what works,

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:90%
what doesn't.

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:54.040 align:middle line:84%
On a scale of 1 to 10,
would you rate it a 10?

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.535 align:middle line:84%
Anything less than
a 10, it's a 7,

00:55:55.535 --> 00:55:57.660 align:middle line:84%
what would it take
to make it a 10?

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Too redundant, there's
self-disclosure, your preaching

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:01.867 align:middle line:90%
at me, whatever it is.

00:56:01.867 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made
"Chicken Soup" so good.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The first version, we
had 40 people read it,

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.635 align:middle line:90%
give us feedback.

00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:10.010 align:middle line:84%
My sister said take out all
the preachy stuff at the end,

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.343 align:middle line:90%
and don't tell me what to think.

00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:13.178 align:middle line:90%
It made the book much better.

00:56:13.178 --> 00:56:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So all of that's
really important.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
to sell the book.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And today you can
publish it on Amazon.

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.710 align:middle line:90%
You can do a Kindle version.

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You can self-publish
at Kinko's and get it--

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amazing.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.272 align:middle line:84%
You can self-publish
an Amazon now.

00:56:27.272 --> 00:56:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Exactly, exactly.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.004 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would always prefer
to work with a big publisher,

00:56:31.004 --> 00:56:33.420 align:middle line:84%
but if you self-publish, which
I recommend a lot of people

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.919 align:middle line:84%
do-- and read Dan Poynter's
book called "The Self-publishing

00:56:35.919 --> 00:56:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Manual."

00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:90%
That is a great resource.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And then John Kremer's book,
"1,001 Ways To Market Your

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Book."

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So those two resources
every author should do.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Because birthing the book's
the feminine part, right?

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Promoting the book is
the masculine part.

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:52.514 align:middle line:84%
And we get a lot of
stillborn births.

00:56:52.514 --> 00:56:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it this way.

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The baby's born, and you
throw it in the dumpster.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, gosh!

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: Because
you don't go out,

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and you don't do the
marketing you need to do.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:59.551 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:56:59.551 --> 00:57:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: So you have
to learn how to do PR,

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.900 align:middle line:84%
how to do interviews,
how to get on the radio.

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.100 align:middle line:90%
You can study all that.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.900 align:middle line:84%
There are books you can
read, seminars you can take,

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:90%
YouTube videos you can watch.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.480 align:middle line:84%
We put together a program
called "Bestseller Blueprint."

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go online,
bestsellerblueprint.com,

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and it is an online
training program for how

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.914 align:middle line:90%
to be a best selling author.

00:57:21.914 --> 00:57:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's a formula.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There is a system
to how do to this.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It all comes back to formula.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:26.879 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Right.

00:57:26.879 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is think big and
think formula is your motto.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's brilliant
because you put it

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.130 align:middle line:84%
into things that
people can actually

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:37.390 align:middle line:90%
do and digest and follow.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Just like that gentleman
did by reading your book.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So in my experience, I
have a book coming out,

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm really excited about it.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And people say don't die
with your story in you,

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.370 align:middle line:90%
so I wrote about my story.

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:52.525 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying now
the whole point is just

00:57:52.525 --> 00:57:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to go out, and bring
it into the world,

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and have faith with
that story, and know

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.040 align:middle line:90%
that it'll help people.

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: When we brought
out the first edition

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.756 align:middle line:84%
of "The Success Principles--"
not I'll be doing this again

00:58:01.756 --> 00:58:04.100 align:middle line:84%
real soon-- I spent
five months on the road.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Five months doing
interviews, print interviews,

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.200 align:middle line:84%
workshops in churches,
workshops in community centers,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:90%
for business groups, et cetera.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:16.500 align:middle line:84%
London, Canada, all
Canada, all across the US,

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Ireland, all across
Europe, for five months.

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Now that was a lot of
work, but it established me

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.632 align:middle line:90%
as now the success guy.

00:58:23.632 --> 00:58:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
everyone has to do it.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:27.890 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the internet
then the way we have it now.

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You can do much more with
your television show,

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:33.829 align:middle line:84%
with the internet, with
affiliate marketing.

00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:34.620 align:middle line:90%
We know a lot more.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So the formula
today is different

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.240 align:middle line:84%
than it was 10 years
ago, and that's

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.630 align:middle line:84%
again like the "Bestseller
Blueprint" and Dan Poynter's

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.750 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got to keep up with it.

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: You have to keep up.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:43.625 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly changing.

00:58:43.625 --> 00:58:44.666 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly changing.

00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's also
the blueprint as well.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a footprint
on the world,

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.830 align:middle line:84%
too, to do it via the internet,
and it can be done, But?

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:53.252 align:middle line:84%
Then the internet gets
heavily trafficked as well.

00:58:53.252 --> 00:58:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CANFIELD: It
does, and you always

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.126 align:middle line:84%
have to be kind
of two steps ahead

00:58:56.126 --> 00:58:58.109 align:middle line:90%
of where it was a month ago.

00:58:58.109 --> 00:59:00.650 align:middle line:84%
There are people now that are
doing these million dollar book

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.525 align:middle line:84%
launches, but they're
different than what you

00:59:02.525 --> 00:59:04.110 align:middle line:90%
did three years ago to do it.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strategic,
launch model

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people that
you know are teaching,

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.237 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a
matter of doing it.

00:59:13.237 --> 00:59:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Tony Robbins once said something
I thought was very important.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, success leaves clues.

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.694 align:middle line:84%
Someone has always done
what you want to do.

00:59:19.694 --> 00:59:20.610 align:middle line:90%
With a few exceptions.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:22.660 align:middle line:84%
First time to the moon,
that kind of thing.

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But basically, there
are people out there

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that have got million dollar
bestselling books in a year, so

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:28.906 align:middle line:90%
what did they do?

00:59:28.906 --> 00:59:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So when "Chicken" came out,
we interviewed the five

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.850 align:middle line:84%
bestselling authors in American
in the self help world-- John

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Gray, Ken Blanchard, people
like that-- and said what

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:37.710 align:middle line:90%
did you do?

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And we looked for the patterns.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, everybody did this.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Only one person did that,
but everybody did this,

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.634 align:middle line:90%
everybody did that.

00:59:44.634 --> 00:59:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Then we said OK,
let's go do that.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've done
the work for us.

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.876 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Yes.

00:59:47.876 --> 00:59:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, that's brilliant.

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You're poured so much
into us in this hour,

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.704 align:middle line:84%
and the range has
just been beautiful.

00:59:55.704 --> 00:59:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: Thank you.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CANFIELD: You're welcome.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.149 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So appreciated
you being here.

01:00:00.149 --> 01:00:02.440 align:middle line:84%
