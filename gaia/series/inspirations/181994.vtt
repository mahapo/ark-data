00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Have
you ever experienced

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:90%
losing track of time?

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:84%
What if you could
actually bend time?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you already
have, like when

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
time seems to fly by
when you're having fun.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And joining me is
Maureen St. Germain,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:10%
known as the practical mystic
and the author of "Waking Up

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:10%
in 5D."

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:10%
Maureen is here to talk about
accessing the fifth dimension

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:10%
to help guide us
in the transition

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:10%
from the polarized mindset of
the third dimension to the joy

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:10%
and the love of the fifth
dimensional vibrations.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN ST. GERMAIN:
Thank you for having me.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.165 align:middle line:90%
It's a real pleasure.

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So fifth
dimension-- what is it?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.442 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
the short answer

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:10%
is it's what all
of our traditions

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:10%
will tell us is heaven.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's the place where
we have a good connection

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
with our divine creator.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:10%
It's the place where we
manifested perfection

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:10%
in our thoughts
and in our minds.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:90%
We have great relationships.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So things are very smooth in
5D, and there's no polarity.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's no right and
wrong or good or bad.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:10%
So the metaphor for that
is taking a child out

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:10%
to play in the mud
puddle and then

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:10%
when it's over, to give them a
bath, and wash their clothes,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:10%
and everything is fine.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.128 align:middle line:84%
And nobody yells at
anybody, because--

00:01:41.128 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's exactly
what should happen, right?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's us.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.142 align:middle line:84%
So we've been playing in
a little bit too much mud.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
third dimension?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
first and second.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth dimension is kind
of like heaven on Earth, right?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I often use that as a phrase.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth dimension
as a location

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
is really a vibrational
data set, and it's nested.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions are nested
like Russian dolls.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about that,
then when you're in five,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
you can fully
participate in three.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in three, even
though you know five is there,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
or you might not
know five is there,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
participate in it.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't understand that
you are impacting it.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you an example.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was at a party
with a boyfriend at the time,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.287 align:middle line:90%
and it was his son's wedding.

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said take a--

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:90%
come.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Take a picture of
me and my buddies.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And the picture
was full of orbs.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And he handed his
camera back to me.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, quit fooling around
and take a real picture.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought the energy
down and took another picture,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was what he
was looking for.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So in 5D, your
vibration is high enough

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can overflow and
impact the world around you.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But yet, when we're
in 3D, that is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the space where mind
control can happen,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
or we can really get under the
influence of messages, right?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
most certainly.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
But there are ways around that.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
People who are
meditating regularly,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:90%
people would do the merkaba.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:90%
That field becomes impenetrable.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
begin to notice.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
What those guys just
said-- that's not right.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.783 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
internal awareness,

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
even though you don't
necessarily know how you know.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it starts.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So the more you adapt
and choose 5D ways,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
it's the old thing about
where the uniform of the job

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
you want, not the
job you have or--

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good idea.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --in the theater.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.262 align:middle line:90%
Fake it till you make it.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.355 align:middle line:90%
So you consciously choose.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.105 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of
what the book is about,

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to teach people these things
you may have been doing.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But what if you could
do them on purpose

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and not just have them
happen randomly, you see?

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you have
an amazing amount

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
of work around the merkaba.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.292 align:middle line:90%
You call it the MerKaBa, right?

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:09.375 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Same thing.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, tell us
how you got involved

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
with the merkaba, how you
were first introduced to it,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and what it is.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: In my case, I
had seen this word somewhere,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
probably when I was in my 30s.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked my spiritual
teacher at the time.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, it's
a spaceship that you build

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:90%
by yourself, for yourself.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was impressed
and forgot about it.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe 10 years
later, I saw a brochure

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:90%
for the workshop.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that looks interesting.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.465 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should take that.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw it
somewhere else.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw it in a
magazine that I read regularly.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying to the
universe, all right, all right.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll sign up.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I got the message.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It hit me three times.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, I'm in.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.377 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what is the merkaba?

00:04:58.377 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, the
merkaba is a global word,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.335 align:middle line:90%
kind of like Kleenex.

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
People use it for
a lot of things.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
People use it to
describe the shape.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But a true merkaba
is a living field.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And a true merkaba has actually
three star tetrahedrons,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
which is what we typically
refer to as the merkaba.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So it has three star
tetrahedrons that are rotating.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
One is stationary.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.517 align:middle line:84%
That represents
the physical body.

00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%
One is spinning to the left.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
One is spinning to the right,
representing the mental body

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional body.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they're kind of
like a car motor in the sense

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that all these layers
start to integrate.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.273 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes the merkaba
with the codes you put into it.

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's interesting,
because it's also

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.607 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of Gaia.

00:05:38.607 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate your--

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.102 align:middle line:84%
we put my little
device next to yours.

00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
wow, how cool is that?

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's the-- others call
it the flower of life?

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: No, the flower of
life is the name of the course

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that people took to learn
the merkaba meditation.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, why are these
two interlaced?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
flower of life symbol,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
which is that symbol of
the circle of circles,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
produces all the
platonic solids.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:10%
And you can see them
layered in it in many ways.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So by connecting
the dots, let's say,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
in the centers of
this shape, you

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
can see all of the
platonic solids, which

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
are the five basic shapes
that create everything.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.675 align:middle line:84%
And just to digress for a
second, a platonic solid--

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
we'll describe one of them.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
A cube means that they all
have the same face, a square.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
They all have the same
angle, the 90-degree turn.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And they all have the
ability that if you

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
put a stick or a skewer in
the middle of it and spun it,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:90%
it would produce a sphere.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So all of the platonic
solids carry those qualities.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are only five
shapes that can do that.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So once you realize that, then
you realize how much we have.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's our source
code for creation.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the source code
for how the pyramids were built

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well--

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.902 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --so many things.

00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --they
produce relationships.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And out of those relationships,
we draw a couple of metaphors.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So I like to explain that this
metaphor is this relationship

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that we know between
a circle and a radius.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And everybody learned 3.14,
but they don't know necessarily

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:90%
how it applies anymore.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they don't remember.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But it is the relationship
between the circle and its area

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.173 align:middle line:84%
or the circle and
its circumference.

00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So we know that as long
as we know the radius,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:90%
we can do a lot of things.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, there
is another relationship.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That is what I call
source code or phi.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Not pi, but phi--

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
P-H-I. And that's where it
fits to the great pyramids,

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
the Parthenon, the relationship
between Mars, Mercury,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.715 align:middle line:84%
and the sun, and all of the
bones of the body, and the DNA.

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a great
way of showing this.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:10%
You have these calipers that--

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:10%
now, explain this.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:10%
This is how the body
was magically built.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It's true.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
This particular device
is called a calipers.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is a way to
show relationship.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, relationship
is always a fraction.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of the
relationship of a third,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:90%
that's easy.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We know it's 33 out of
100 or one fourth reduces.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of
a relationship is

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the family of
irrational numbers like pi.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Pi always has more numbers.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.495 align:middle line:84%
No matter how far
out you go, you

00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:90%
can always add another number.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The same is true with
this relationship,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:90%
but the calipers adjust.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So as you get bigger or smaller,
you can see the relationship.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much more fun,
because it makes sense.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So if the small number is 1,
then the big number is 1.618.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.874 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
hold up your hand or--

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
yeah, hold it up like this,
maybe, and I will show.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we want
to measure the little finger

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to the wrist, you can easily
see where these points land.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go down
to your elbow,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and we put the
bottom at the elbow,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and we put the top at
your little finger again,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:90%
it shows where your wrist is.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: OK?

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
So it always shows where it is.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite amazing--

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.505 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --and helps.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.792 align:middle line:90%
Now, on the face--

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
now, you want me to do
it on your face or mine?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your face.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: OK,
so we can mark.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
From the third eye or
the middle of the brow

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the head is 1.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And then this becomes 1.618.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And the way we do that--

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Careful.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah,
careful is right.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Then when we do
that, it's like this.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And then if we want to know
where the base of the nose is,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:90%
we can do this.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.987 align:middle line:90%
And we can see that again.

00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting,
because not everybody

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
has a perfect face,
so not everyone is

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:90%
going to have this proportion.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you take
a hundred people,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
they're all going
to work out to that.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
dentists use this,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:84%
architects use this, builders
use this, because they know.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And designers use this.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.738 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
this calipers--

00:09:56.738 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:90%
and I do this in every class--

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to a design, like
a woman is wearing

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful, colorful
top, we could

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:90%
show where they've used phi.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And phi is the most pleasing
proportion to humans.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We identify with it, because
it is our source code.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
to show people--

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that's why builders
and designers

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.137 align:middle line:84%
use this, because you're more
likely to buy that product.

00:10:22.137 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's the perfect
ratio, essentially,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that we see naturally.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And it is
the only division of 1 that

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:90%
is the same in both directions.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So if I do this, I can show
that my little finger is 1.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:90%
And to my wrist is 1.618.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But what if I made this
whole thing from here?

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The bigger one,
the little one, OK?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:90%
And lock it in.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
It should show the whole
length, and it does.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So you
can do it this way

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and show the proportion
to the little finger.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
little finger would be 1

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:90%
and to the wrist is 1.618.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And then if you decide to
make the bigger number, which

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:90%
is the 1.618, the 1--

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To the middle.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: OK?

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to hold it tight,
so it doesn't move on me.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it matches.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So this means--

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it always matches.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --as
you look at a spiral,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
it's the same going
out or going in.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So that is "perfection."

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, humans have a
beginning and an end.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
So we start with one.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But in the "world" of
geometry or ideals,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
you could easily let this
go tinier and tinier.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.242 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is basically
what sacred geometry is?

00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: This is
what sacred geometry is.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about sacred geometry--

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
what makes geometry different
from sacred geometry

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
is that we give meaning
and purpose to shapes

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.582 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't see before.

00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we give
them meaning and purpose

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:84%
is because we can tie
them back to our bodies,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to our observable
artifacts, and so on.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does this
all work in our life

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
when we go to the
fifth dimension?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:90%
What's available to us there?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, first
of all, any sacred geometry,

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:10%
any geometric
shapes, whether it's

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:10%
like on the cover of my book
or other beautiful mandalas

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:10%
that you are attracted
to-- they imprint us

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:10%
with what I would call
divine source codes.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, in 3D, we were
allowed to play in the mud.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
In 5D, we're not interested
in getting muddy anymore.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So what 5D has to
offer is so much

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
more creativity in terms of
options and what's possible.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.377 align:middle line:84%
And even though we're leaving
behind the negative choice,

00:13:00.377 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:90%
we're not leaving behind choice.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think,
well, if you're in heaven,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
there's only one choice.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying, what
color is the best color?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.062 align:middle line:90%
They're all good.

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But some colors
look better on you.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Some colors look better on me.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so in 5D, we
have the capacity

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to have unconditional
love for our fellow man.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We have the capacity
to have an experience

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and not perceive
it as bad or wrong.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, if your
best friend says to you--

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
you tell her about
some wonderful thing

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:90%
that's happened.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.338 align:middle line:84%
And she says, must be nice, but
she's saying it to get a laugh.

00:13:36.338 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't be offended.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
You'd laugh.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.938 align:middle line:90%
You'd have fun with it.

00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a 5D response.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
she's jealous of you

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and she says that,
now you kind of, hmm.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:90%
See the difference?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You drop down into
the lower dimensional thinking

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Not only
that, but when you ask about,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
what does 5D have to offer?

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And the idea is 5D--

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.475 align:middle line:90%
you only see the good side.

00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's
the highest self.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is our higher self.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It
is our higher self.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, we're all
becoming fifth dimension.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for a few.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of us will
spontaneously go into it.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Some of us will learn and study.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of us will be so
attracted to the geometry

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies will
just kind of align,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and we'll fall into it.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people study,
and study, and study.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they have this big
aha, and everything shifts.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of ways
people shift into that.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, can
the merkaba help us

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
move into that fifth dimension?

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And I began a dialogue
with my higher self

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
when I activated my merkaba
that taught me a lot of what

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:90%
we're about to say.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
the merkaba creates

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
what I call the fifth
dimensional uniform.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.965 align:middle line:84%
So even if I'm not a queen, if
I can put on a queen costume,

00:14:48.965 --> 00:14:50.715 align:middle line:84%
you're going to treat
me like I'm a queen.

00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you're acting as if?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
the merkaba is

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
you don't know you're acting.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It's for you.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's real, because
you're on the inside.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But everybody outside sees
that you're different.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:90%
They notice you're different.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're in a much better
place to hear your inner voice.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Because all that riff-raff
is kind of around you.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
scene in "The Matrix--"

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the very first one where there's
bullets coming at Neo and he's

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:90%
dodging them?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from the
expression on his face,

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
he's thinking, wow, I
didn't know I could do that.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what happens
when you activate your merkaba.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You literally don't realize, oh,
I didn't know I could do that.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So you in hindsight--

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
hindsight gives you
that bigger perspective.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, we don't
know that we've been 5D.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big,
big, trippy thing.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I asked about
this, my guides were very clear

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, Maureen, you
were in 5D when this happened.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
is I had put something

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
down in a place that was
pretty obvious, maybe a drawer

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and came back to get it.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Shortly thereafter, it was gone.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.282 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't so long
ago that I'd forgotten.

00:16:03.282 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of bummed,
because I really needed it.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But then I found a substitute,
took care of whatever.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Came back in a
nice, yummy space,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
opened the door to put
the-- it was there.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm keeping this a
little secret in my own head,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.242 align:middle line:84%
but I'm teaching
classes every week.

00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of
wondering if people

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:90%
are having the same experience.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And then one of
my sons came home.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.593 align:middle line:90%
And he was 16 at the time.

00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:27.218 align:middle line:84%
And he threw something
in his book bag,

00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and we went through
the same thing.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mom, let
me show you what it is.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.988 align:middle line:84%
And he goes back to his book
bag, and it's not there.

00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, I had seen him put it in.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So without even
thinking, because I

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.047 align:middle line:84%
was in my own home in
a "safe environment,"

00:16:39.047 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, honey, it's
probably in the fifth dimension.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.838 align:middle line:84%
We'll just ask for
it to come back.

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:45.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, come back in the kitchen
and finish your story.

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And when he went back,
it was right on top.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.953 align:middle line:84%
And he'd already
pulled everything out

00:16:48.953 --> 00:16:50.312 align:middle line:90%
and put everything back.

00:16:50.312 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
That's when I knew I
wasn't making it up.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I began to
teach the other students

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.045 align:middle line:84%
and discovered oh, yeah,
it's happening to them.

00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are in and
out of the fifth dimension.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.593 align:middle line:90%
So it is essentially a state.

00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It's
a vibrational state.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so, one, how
do we know we're in it?

00:17:08.255 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, you
think everything is funny.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.713 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the ways you know.

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's good.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Something
somewhat tragic

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.275 align:middle line:90%
for yourself happens.

00:17:16.275 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And you can laugh about it.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're not at all
disturbed about it.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
There are some very
tangible things.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
be at a traffic light.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're the third car back.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.267 align:middle line:84%
And you notice the light has
changed, but nobody is moving.

00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:90%
But you're not in a hurry.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Nobody started to
cross the street.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The cars in front
haven't started moving.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, like somebody

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
said, OK, then they go.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:90%
You were in 5D.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
observing the reality

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:90%
before the 3Ders see it.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This happens when
you drive long distances,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know--

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.707 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --how you get there.

00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Another thing
is you can get in less time.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So you're compressing time.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.863 align:middle line:84%
You're just sliding
through, quote, "time."

00:17:57.863 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And you arrive at
your destination

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
faster than you should have
under normal circumstances.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But one of those keys is
you don't wear a watch.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.645 align:middle line:84%
You don't listen to the radio
that's going to mark the time.

00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
You just move into
that blissful place.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.562 align:middle line:90%
You put on your favorite music.

00:18:10.562 --> 00:18:11.713 align:middle line:90%
You keep changing it up.

00:18:11.713 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're not paying
attention to time.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody says, how
did you get here so fast?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:90%
This happened to me in Egypt.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And the company owner said to
me, Maureen, nobody but you

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and Gregg Braden has
ever pulled this off.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
We've arrived at the
destination in three hours,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:90%
instead of the normal five.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And we went through checks--

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
checkpoints and everything to
get from point A to point B.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you consciously
move into the fifth dimension

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
when you're in your world,
in your waking world.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I name it.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I purposefully name it.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.122 align:middle line:84%
So I announce when I go to bed
at night, I am waking up in 5D.

00:18:47.122 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:90%
And so I set the stage.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So even when I wake
up, if I'm feeling--

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- gnarly
or I had a rough night--

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
within a few seconds, I'm
right there and in my game.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, though, people
who are proactively doing

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
this-- what I do--

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
are still sliding into
5D and don't know it.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways is the
5D merkaba meditation--

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
this multi-dimensional
merkaba that's in the book

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and also available on the CD
is when my husband and I first

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
started doing it-- when he first
started doing it regularly,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:90%
he got funny.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:90%
He's a scientist.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:90%
He's rather dry.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's a sweet person, but
he started cracking jokes.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, what's--

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
how did-- where is
this coming from?

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
asked the question,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the answer was, well,
that energy elevates you

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
to a place where you see the
synchronicities, the irony.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.488 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't disturb
you like it used to.

00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now, can you--
does that protect you

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:90%
from negative energies?

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.918 align:middle line:84%
Do negative energies
exist in 5D?

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah, that's
a very good question.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I've had that
question many times.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've meditated
about this a lot.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I finally came
to the conclusion

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that when you are
thinking about protection,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
you're already sliding back
into 3D, because protection

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:90%
implies danger.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to use
the 5D for protection.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But in another
vantage point in 5D,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
you don't need protection,
because you're always

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
where you need to be.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You're always doing what
you're supposed to do.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York City
the day before 9/11

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and was told to
fly home that day,

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of flying home on my
original plan of September 11.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of other
examples that I've encountered

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and my people have
encountered where

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
they realize in hindsight
that they knew what they

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to do before.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.825 align:middle line:84%
So hindsight is one
way of explaining it?

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, hindsight is

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
one way of knowing that
you were 5D, because you

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:90%
have a point of perspective.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You get to the point where
you don't think about it.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And even thinking about it
can pull you back into 3D.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
start to think about

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the polarity consciousness,
and good and bad,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and he done me wrong, and when
will this guy ever pay me back?

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Or when will this
guy get his sentence?

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Lots of things
that have happened.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And people want to make sure
that, quote, "that punishment"

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm not opposed to
people being held accountable,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
the thing is that
was the 3D game.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not changing the
rules of the 3D game,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
because that wouldn't be fair.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:90%
We're changing up the game.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Completely.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's a new game.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.817 align:middle line:84%
And the new game does not
require to keep score.

00:21:33.817 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if there's
no competition--

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's right.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.118 align:middle line:90%
There's no competition.

00:21:37.118 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:90%
That's another way you know.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
When you see somebody
that is doing what you're

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
doing or doing something
similar and related,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:90%
you want to help them.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And they want to help you.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So sports really
doesn't have a lot of 5D in it.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Or, can it?

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.893 align:middle line:84%
Because you're also describing
it as if it's the zone.

00:21:53.893 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
You're in the zone,
it seems like.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And I
love sports analogies.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all
about connecting.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.712 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: There's
another game that's widely

00:21:59.712 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
used all over the United States,
and it's played with a Frisbee,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's called Ultima.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And Ultima is like
a bowling league,

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
only you do it with Frisbee.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, in Ultima,
if your opponent calls a foul

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:90%
on you, you take it.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to dispute it.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you decide
I've misbehaved,

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.065 align:middle line:84%
touched you the wrong
way, I have to say OK.

00:22:23.065 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
rules of the game.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- because
you're acting as gentlemen,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:84%
there's a unwritten rule
that you don't call foul,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:90%
unless there's a real one.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want to
have them do it to you.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fun thing is at the
end of the game, the opponent--

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
the losing team has
to make up a ditty

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.168 align:middle line:84%
to sing to the winning team,
based upon whatever they

00:22:45.168 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:90%
know of their name or whatever.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It's hilarious.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It sounds like fun.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.547 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It
is a lot of fun.

00:22:50.547 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's played by
20 to 30-somethings.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.328 align:middle line:84%
And all my sons
play it, and that's

00:22:54.328 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:90%
how come I know about it.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's fun.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:90%
That's really fun.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And they
played on city-wide leagues--

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So--

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.547 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --like
you would bowling.

00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --you can
do anything in 5D.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:90%
You can work.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:90%
You can raise children.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You can have relationships.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.173 align:middle line:84%
It's just all higher
consciousness thinking, right?

00:23:09.173 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's right.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
abandonment of the mind.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
The mind leads, but
the heart rules.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a dance, and
it's a marriage.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:90%
So you do your due diligence.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.922 align:middle line:84%
You look at what
all the options are,

00:23:25.922 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you let
your heart decide.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.683 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
your heart is going

00:23:29.683 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
to tell you to do something
that's counter-intuitive

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:90%
or counter to what the logic is.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you've done
all the logic,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
you're not afraid
to take that leap.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, can you go
into 5D in a meditation,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and create what you want,
and bring it back into 3D?

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.902 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes, very easily.

00:23:47.902 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Say if, for
example, you are sick

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and you want to have
that healthy body.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring it back into now?

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you create the ideal
job you want and bring it

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
back into now?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
A relationship?

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.362 align:middle line:90%
Can you play?

00:24:00.362 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes,
most certainly.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to have a
metaphor in that example.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So if, for example, you
want a new assistant,

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
because your current
assistant is leaving.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And you were happy
with her, but maybe you

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.747 align:middle line:84%
had the "perfect
assistant" years ago.

00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And you would love to
have someone like that

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
as long as you get to replace.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So you could imagine
that a person just

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.347 align:middle line:84%
like the darling is
now working for you.

00:24:23.347 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And you're in that place of joy.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would make
you happy right away.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:90%
You would just be blissful.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you hold that
as long as you can,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:84%
maybe three seconds,
five seconds.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And then every time you
go by the empty desk,

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you say, thank you, universe,
for my new assistant.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Your energy is
different, you see?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
goes, OK, we got it.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:90%
We got a pattern.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We got to
have assistants.

00:24:45.297 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I could just do that and
maybe have someone help me.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.947 align:middle line:90%
Would that be possible?

00:24:48.947 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Absolutely.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
this wonderful image

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that we have here,
where the light

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.673 align:middle line:90%
is spinning around the body.

00:24:56.673 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The merkaba is spinning
around the body.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
What is this image?

00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: OK.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a slow motion
example of a spinning merkaba.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is step
one of phase four.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is you're going

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to spin these at equal
speed, so the spin is equal.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
seeing is this quality

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
of the star tetrahedrons
intersecting each other.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.050 align:middle line:84%
They all are on the same axis,
like the Earth axis is a stick.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So see that the pranic
tube is the center.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:90%
These things move around it.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they represent
the physical body,

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
which is stationary, and
then the emotional body

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:90%
and mental body.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is
create a relationship.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And that relationship is the
speed at which we evolve.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's that phi ratio that
I was talking about earlier.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:90%
So we create a relationship.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're not even
anymore, and they

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.843 align:middle line:90%
have a little bit of a wobble.

00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So how are you going to
get rid of the wobble?

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is the wobble--

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
you're taking the speed up to
the speed of which electrons

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
move inside an atom, which
is 9/10 the speed of light.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't completely
get rid of the wobble,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.072 align:middle line:84%
but it's so small,
it's indiscernible.

00:26:09.072 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way to
really understand it

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
is imagine a car with
a broken rear spring.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
It would list as you drive it.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But the faster you go,
the less of a wobble

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
there is, because it
slides back to the center.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you're moving so
fast through the curve.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that why the
spinning merkaba is--

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:84%
as you call it,
merkaba is the image

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that we usually see of
the spinning merkaba?

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Because here we have--

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: The
stationary ones.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stationary.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.255 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually on a
string and spins, right?

00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
three of those.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't spin the top and
the bottom against each other.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:84%
You have three
full-star tetrahedrons--

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
one spinning left, one spinning
right, and one not moving.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Three separate ones?

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Three separate ones,

00:26:54.078 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:90%
but they occupy the same space.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.163 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the image
that we showed earlier

00:26:58.163 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
is almost confusing, because
you're literally seeing

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:90%
them going inside each other.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the presumption is
that they can move around

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.967 align:middle line:84%
each other without hitting
a wall, so to speak.

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
bending time looks like?

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mm-hmm.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things
about bending time.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what's another?

00:27:15.165 --> 00:27:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, unhooking.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We all have things
that lock us into what

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I would call mass
consciousness-- the morning

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
coffee, the newspaper, or
the internet show we watch,

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:84%
That thing we have to do
first thing in the morning

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:90%
before we go to work.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
All those things, those
rituals that everybody does

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
locks us into the
mass consciousness.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we say, OK,
give me the download.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you don't
even realize you're doing it.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So when we change
up those rituals,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
when we change up the
timing of the more--

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.975 align:middle line:84%
maybe we drink coffee
every other day,

00:27:45.975 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:90%
or we drink coffee one day.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:90%
We skip a week, whatever it is.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we are
unhooking from what

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
you call the programming that's
coming in that's being beamed

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
at us, because it's like this.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I used to get a
newspaper on my front door that

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:90%
advertised cards and dating.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had to call
them to opt out.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:07.748 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: You see?

00:28:07.748 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to opt
out of that energy.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.215 align:middle line:90%
It's coming at us.

00:28:11.215 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.298 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It's presumed.

00:28:13.298 --> 00:28:15.708 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do something
about unhooking from it.

00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
our responsibility.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That
is our responsibility.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Otherwise, the default
mechanism in the world is

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:90%
to have conditional--

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It is the default
that is presently occurring

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:90%
on mass consciousness.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.403 align:middle line:84%
But we are both
hopeful, I think--

00:28:29.403 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, I mean--

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --for a change.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --it's everything.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's marketing.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --everything.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
It's exactly right.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anything that
there's conditioning

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
where someone is
trying to convince you

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of their point of view,
you can easily just go

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth
dimension and look at it

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.918 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, not only that,

00:28:45.918 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:10%
but when you are holding
that energy for yourself

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:10%
and you're in that
blissful state, you notice.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.790 align:middle line:10%
That part's not true.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.717 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is--

00:28:54.717 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:10%
and this is one of the
very important things

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:10%
that I tell people.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.738 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to
dismiss everything.

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to throw the
baby out with the bathwater.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do
is have discernment.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the fastest way to
get people to buy something

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is to tell them 1, 2,
3 things that are true,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.478 align:middle line:90%
one fib, and another truth.

00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And you buy the whole thing,
because, well, these three

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
things are true.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.817 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it must be true.

00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: We all do it.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, there is something
called the golden bowl

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where did
you discover this?

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.973 align:middle line:84%
Where is it listed or
talked about in history?

00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, first of all,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.807 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you that I was
being given this information

00:29:29.807 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:90%
for about seven years.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And I understood it clearly,
but I was never given authority

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
to release it to the masses.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.407 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Given this, being
through your guidance?

00:29:40.407 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's awareness
of what's going on.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's just you have it
as a piece of information.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's not being
lowered to be available.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's from
Ecclesiastes 12:6 and 7.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the exact words are
"Remember your creator,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.630 align:middle line:84%
now while you were young,
before the silver record of life

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
snaps and the golden
bowl is broken."

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was written
by a man who was

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
discussing his lessons of
life and trying to give

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:90%
some advice for the future.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was referring
to when you would die.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, we've all heard about
the silver cord, but hardly

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.095 align:middle line:84%
anybody talks about
the golden bowl.

00:30:26.095 --> 00:30:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And all the traditional
interpretations

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of the golden bowl
don't make a match.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Because once you understand that
the golden bowl is the sinuses

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and that the air coming in the
body is the breath of life,

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
this energy that sits right
here and goes all the way

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to the back.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So the guided meditation
is now available.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
that a person get it.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's on my website.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It's very inexpensive, because
you can get it as a download.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And you want to listen
to the invocation

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and the actual
meditation together.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And you want to do
that a number of times.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you'll do
just the meditation,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.663 align:middle line:90%
because it's only 12 minutes.

00:31:07.663 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is a
specific meditation

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that you teach people
to be able to bring

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:84%
this breath into the
sinus cavities, which

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:19.813 align:middle line:84%
are a biblical reference
of the breath of life.

00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Indeed.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that attaches
you with the silver cord

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to your body.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something
that can help you,

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
again, get to that fifth
dimensional thinking.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, I send it out

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
as an opportunity for
people to explore as a beta.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing people
notice is their sinuses clear.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Even when your sinuses
aren't stuffed up,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:90%
they feel this opening, OK?

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's a tangible shift.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
What that does is
opens up the pineal.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And now, the pineal
has a platform

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
like a rocket to take off.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So then if you're doing it
on a regular basis, what

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
happens is your
capacity to receive

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:90%
has increased dramatically.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's kind of
a clearing for that--

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It
is a big clearing.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --to be received.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:84%
What about people who have
migraines and headaches?

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, I've gotten
a lot of reports from people.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling me
their headaches are gone.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Their sinus problems are gone.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To do this
type of meditation.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it starts off with the
bowl sound and then brings in--

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and you have that breath
coming through and clearing

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:90%
these areas.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I'm actually
announcing certain things

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And we are bringing
in the energy.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.910 align:middle line:90%
We're filling it in the heart.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we're sending it up the
body through the pranic tube.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's forming a torus field,
kind of like an apple shape.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So wherever it's at, it's making
a big torus around the body.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
up to the throat,

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.898 align:middle line:84%
clears that, makes
another big torus.

00:32:43.898 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep building
all these toruses.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes to the
physical body, the mental body,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.018 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional body.

00:32:49.018 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearing
all the effluvia

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:90%
that we all have from life.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Effluvia?

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
That's just the junk.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this meditation
has helped you access this

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:90%
various--

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:84%
ideas in your life, various
manifestations in your life.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.596 align:middle line:90%
Can you share with those?

00:33:10.596 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, for me, it's

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
allowed the third
eye to be much more

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.408 align:middle line:90%
active and available to me.

00:33:17.408 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you see
things in a different way.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are very mental.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They're very devoted
to their meditations

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
or their spiritual
practices, but they're not

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:84%
getting any "visual,"
like some people do.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And those people are going
to get a huge benefit

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:90%
from the visual improvement.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The people that
are very visual--

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.410 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get a
big improvement in words.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's going to change--

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Brings
you to balance.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Change your leads.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So we have an
actual video here--

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:90%
"Spirit Family."

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And take a look at this video.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I have always been psychic.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I have always had a
knowing or an understanding

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
How many people in
the corporate world

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
knew that you had an
interest in spiritual things,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and magic, and
that kind of stuff?

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe two.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And why did you choose
to never talk about it?

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I hear.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are times
when I sense something,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not always sure.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Should I express it or not?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:84%
>> When I walk into the room, it
actually feels like I'm walking

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:90%
into mud.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's very heavy.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
I'm totally exhausted.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And how can I not be affected?

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Because sometimes what
you're feeling is the energy

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.465 align:middle line:84%
of something that
happened before.

00:34:49.465 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And some people get called,
some people get tracked down,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.307 align:middle line:84%
or some people get
hit by lightning.

00:34:57.307 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:90%
I had the lightning thing.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And it makes it come back, back.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe that
everyone here is a healer.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is psychic.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of you being aware of it.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is a
great example of something

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that you did that helped
you manifest something.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you see and
create all of this?

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me that story.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, the story is

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that I had been doing television
shows in my early years

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:90%
in my corporate world.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I always got great feedback
that I was a great host,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:90%
and I did a good job on camera.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so at a certain
point, I thought,

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the next steps for
me might be a TV show.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So I put that into
manifestation.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Then one day a man showed up
at the Edgar Cayce Center,

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
looking for a specific
kind of person.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And he had singled
out a number of people

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and kind of checked in on him.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And he ended up with me.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down, and he
interviewed me as a producer.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And we came up with a budget.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
floated that energy.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, we need this money for a
show to create what we want.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that
we would create this,

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that it would attract the
attention of somebody who

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
would want to take
it to the next level.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
of "Spirit Family"

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is me with a number
of people who are

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:90%
on the inside in various ways--

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:84%
an angel lady, or a
psychic, or a medium,

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and then having the
audience ask the questions.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you did this.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And you put this all together.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is a perfect example of
how to manifest your desires.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And you say you
put it out there,

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.140 align:middle line:84%
or you put it into
the fifth dimension.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to create with
the assistance of any guidance

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:90%
that's available to us.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's right.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that I figured out--

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's a book that I
wrote called "Be a Genie."

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:10%
And it describes
the sacred geometry

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.217 align:middle line:10%
in a much bigger detail.

00:36:52.217 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:10%
And then how does
that sacred geometry

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:10%
dovetail with manifestation?

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:10%
So in the book, I described
the steps of manifestation.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is you're
looking at a timeline.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that timeline
is where you are now

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.853 align:middle line:90%
and where you want to be.

00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And then you go beyond that.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I call it the "after event."

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And the best example I know
of that people can relate to

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
is a woman or a man who wants
to be partnered or married

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:90%
to their beloved.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:84%
They haven't found
the right match yet.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So what you would do is you
would visualize yourself

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.480 align:middle line:84%
not at the wedding,
not moving in together.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But you would visualize yourself
celebrating an anniversary

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:90%
of a year or five years.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.935 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to name
what anniversary it is.

00:37:36.935 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And what do people do when
they celebrate an anniversary?

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.185 align:middle line:84%
They go out to dinner,
and they make a toast.

00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just
with pop or something,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:90%
they make that toast.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they say
something sweet

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:90%
like, I am so happy that we met.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful that
I'm with my perfect partner.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you hear what
the person would say.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Depending on your
gender preference,

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.140 align:middle line:90%
you know what gender it is.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to know who it is.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's better if you
don't fixate on a person.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you fixate
on these qualities.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you know
in a mind movie, so to speak,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:84%
where you are sharing your love
and appreciation for the other,

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and they are sharing it for you.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.865 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens is when you
pretend that someone is telling

00:38:24.865 --> 00:38:26.740 align:middle line:84%
you how wonderful you
are, and how happy they

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
are, that they know
you, and that you're

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.708 align:middle line:90%
their special someone--

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.732 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you feel good.

00:38:31.732 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
--sometimes you cry.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that energy
is real powerful.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
do is you say, OK,

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:90%
that's your movie of the mind.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, you let that percolate.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And you run that movie
as much as you want.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And what happens sometimes
is the movie itself--

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:90%
the script changes.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So even though I've
scripted that my beloved is

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
going to say one thing,
I'll hear him say another.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That's when you know
the universe has got it.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're working on it.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's already out there.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:90%
And all you do is show up.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:90%
And then this is the part.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Showing up is very important.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.730 align:middle line:90%
So when you get a message--

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.147 align:middle line:84%
you need to go to
the bar tonight.

00:39:05.147 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm too tired.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A bar?

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't think of
a better place?

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
A bar?

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
So OK, fine.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:90%
So you go.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.370 align:middle line:84%
You ordered a cup of
coffee, because you're not

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:90%
going to drink, whatever it is.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And you meet the person that
you're supposed to meet.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't
have done it if you

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.578 align:middle line:90%
hadn't followed the guidance.

00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if you're
trying to heal something,

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:84%
you get hooked up
with a healer that

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.200 align:middle line:84%
will help you find your
way to perfect health.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.617 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
the universe is

00:39:31.617 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:84%
going to take care
of all the details.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.920 align:middle line:84%
What it means is the universe
is going to give you the fastest

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
way to the outcome you want.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you didn't say, I
want to go to that castle

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going to
get what I want.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going beyond the castle.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.147 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking backwards.

00:39:45.147 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I do with
the sacred geometry

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:90%
is I show how the math adds up.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that the math
adds up, you no longer doubt.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the biggest reason
people don't manifest

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.760 align:middle line:84%
isn't because they don't try
or because they don't know how.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It's because they
do a big takeaway.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine if
we're at a restaurant?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:90%
I order something.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I see the next--
oh, call the waiter back.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I want what he's getting.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I want that instead.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And
we keep changing it.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon you just let us know
when you've made up your mind.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And the energy has
dissipated, whereas if you say

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.998 align:middle line:90%
focus on the thing you want.

00:40:12.998 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes people
say, well, what

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
if the person I was engaged
to doesn't work out?

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've all heard
stories about somebody

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:90%
who was engaged to one person.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.707 align:middle line:90%
You meet them on the street.

00:40:20.707 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.093 align:middle line:90%
How did that work out?

00:40:23.093 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, we broke up.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.640 align:middle line:90%
No, it's OK.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I met somebody else.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
We're married.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And you think, how
did they pull--

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So--

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --that off?

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --it worked out.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Because they didn't

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:90%
stay in judgment or anger.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the judgment or
anger seeds the universe

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.448 align:middle line:90%
with what we don't want.

00:40:35.448 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So I wanted to ask you.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.047 align:middle line:84%
You worked on the board at
the Edgar Casey Foundation.

00:40:40.047 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
real quickly there.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:90%
What did you do there?

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
I was on their board

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:84%
initially to help
them, as I had been

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.972 align:middle line:84%
a certified
non-profit executive.

00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
experience and training

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%
in working with non-profits.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted someone
who was well-known who

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:90%
could work with them.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a time
when I served briefly

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.388 align:middle line:84%
as their treasurer when
they were between people.

00:41:02.388 --> 00:41:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was very clear with them.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Even though I could
do that job, I

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:90%
wasn't interested in that job.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was only like a
pick-up to help hold that.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was mostly just to
help that organization.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But did
you love his work--

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce?

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:14.568 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Oh, yes.

00:41:14.568 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I was a member of
the Search for God

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:middle line:84%
study group when
I was in my 20s.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had read his
book when I was still

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.248 align:middle line:90%
at home, the book on his life.

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
were raising babies.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And when
I was raising babies.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that
was very important.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.253 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the things I
could do when you're a mom.

00:41:31.253 --> 00:41:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Study.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.045 align:middle line:84%
He worked in the
fifth dimension a lot.

00:41:35.045 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes, he did.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's another
example of someone

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:45.290 align:middle line:84%
who experienced something
that he couldn't explain.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when he
would come back and listen

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.608 align:middle line:84%
to the transcripts or read
the transcripts that he

00:41:51.608 --> 00:41:53.150 align:middle line:84%
would begin to
understand, because he

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:90%
was a devout Christian.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even believe
in reincarnation.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But he came to believe
in it, because he

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.477 align:middle line:84%
was being told stories
about who he was in Egypt.

00:42:02.477 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: These channelings.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he would record
them, and we'd hear them back.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And he
had a wonderful secretary

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.008 align:middle line:90%
who was recording everything.

00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, a phenomenal
person and transitioned out.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But now, do you have
guides you work with?

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And how do you get all of
this information, Maureen?

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I do have guides.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I was given a permanent
guide a number of years ago

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that is like on my right
shoulder, always helping me,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.288 align:middle line:90%
always keeping me aware.

00:42:25.288 --> 00:42:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I think because I have such a
strong connection to the higher

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:84%
self, I have a
direct connection.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the information
I get is a knowing.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And then later, I
can see other people

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:90%
are saying the same thing.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So my inner circle
knows, but I haven't

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.240 align:middle line:84%
been comfortable taking
it out as a knowing.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.683 align:middle line:84%
There are other guides
that work through me.

00:42:46.683 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:84%
One time when I was teaching
a manifestation course,

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and I was teaching people about
time and how it's a construct,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and I sat down to give
a channeled message.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And out of my mouth
came the words,

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:90%
we are the lords of time.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And even I had never heard of
them, so it's very interesting.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you teach us
to connect with our guides?

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
the fastest way

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is to develop a higher
self connection.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.940 align:middle line:90%
And the higher self connection--

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.910 align:middle line:90%
I developed a protocol.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.952 align:middle line:84%
But I will say I went to
my higher self and said,

00:43:13.952 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:90%
give me a protocol.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then it came back.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So I can't
even take credit for that, OK?

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.963 align:middle line:90%
And the protocol is very simple.

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:90%
There's seven parts to it.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.023 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is
choose a time frame.

00:43:23.023 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And the time frame
is six weeks or more.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So you pick a date six
weeks into the future.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And you agree with
your guidance that you

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
are going to do this
protocol for six weeks.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you follow a
simple set of rules.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you only
ask yes/no questions.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
You only ask about
unimportant things

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're willing
to do either way.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.960 align:middle line:10%
You don't keep asking the
same question over and over.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.570 align:middle line:84%
If you've asked
twice, you're done.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Unimportant things you're
willing to do either way?

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Like you're looking
at a plate of cookies.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:84%
You'd like to have a
cookie, but maybe you

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.717 align:middle line:90%
can live without the cookie.

00:43:53.717 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Higher self, is it my highest,
best good to have a cookie?

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be the
clothes you wear.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.010 align:middle line:84%
One time a woman
came to class dressed

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in a very strange combination
of jewelry and clothing.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed that look
women give each other when

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:90%
they're looking at each other.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.577 align:middle line:84%
Well, I like that
outfit, kind of thing.

00:44:10.577 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And she shook her fingers.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't even ask.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:90%
My higher self dressed me today.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
willingness part, OK?

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a woman
who came to a class

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.790 align:middle line:84%
recently who said that she
asked her higher self if she

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.590 align:middle line:90%
should have meat at breakfast.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And she says I'm a vegan.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Why would my higher
self tell me yes?

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because
your higher self

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.943 align:middle line:84%
was trying to show
you that you're not

00:44:30.943 --> 00:44:32.265 align:middle line:90%
practicing the protocol.

00:44:32.265 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said, but I
know my higher self

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.098 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't tell me to eat meat.

00:44:35.098 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the protocol
is you have to be willing.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And since you asked,
you have to follow.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way to notice that
you're not-- you're only

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:90%
asking "loaded questions."

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:45.440 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't count.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:84%
That's not a true
protocol, you see?

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to be willing
to listen to the higher self.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Not
only listen, but to be

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.790 align:middle line:90%
responsive to the instruction.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if you get
told to wear the red dress

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and you were thinking
you should wear a blue,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.600 align:middle line:90%
you want to follow that.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And if it's
really important to you,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.947 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
be on a set, and you

00:45:06.947 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:84%
know red doesn't look good, then
what you do is you don't ask.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:90%
You just make that decision.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that you
spend six weeks doing this.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And this protocol
amps up your ability

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.935 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the voice
or the inner answer

00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:90%
from the higher self.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.677 align:middle line:84%
Now, the inner answer
can be anything.

00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:25.135 align:middle line:84%
I take people
through a meditation.

00:45:25.135 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
your ear itching.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It could be a feeling
in your stomach.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It could be a color
or a shape you see.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's different.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And some people get stuck.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we teach them
what I call a workaround.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's ways to
develop the yes/no signal.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's primary.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.485 align:middle line:84%
Then you practice with the
yes/no signal for six weeks.

00:45:43.485 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is give you history.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Because how do we
make decisions?

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
We make decisions by
looking at history.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:52.530 align:middle line:90%
We look on the internet.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.572 align:middle line:90%
We're going to buy a car.

00:45:53.572 --> 00:45:54.440 align:middle line:90%
We look at the car--

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Prices.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.942 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --reports.

00:45:55.942 --> 00:45:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We look at what our
friends tell us.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.792 align:middle line:90%
We may even go for test drives.

00:45:58.792 --> 00:46:00.260 align:middle line:90%
We got all this history.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So we develop a
history that shows us

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:84%
that our higher self was
giving us good information.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Higher self tells you,
make that phone call now.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm busy.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:10.638 align:middle line:90%
No, make the call now.

00:46:10.638 --> 00:46:11.930 align:middle line:90%
So you do, and you get through.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.928 align:middle line:84%
And three previous
times you didn't.

00:46:13.928 --> 00:46:14.970 align:middle line:90%
You ask your higher self.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Do I go to this restaurant?

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.670 align:middle line:90%
No, this restaurant.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So you go to that restaurant
and you meet up with a friend.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.757 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is over
the six weeks of "play--"

00:46:21.757 --> 00:46:23.090 align:middle line:90%
and it is supposed to be played.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be fun.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you get all
kinds of subjective reference

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:84%
points that allows you
to know that your higher

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.340 align:middle line:90%
self is accurate.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And what's the difference
between trusting your higher

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
self and knowing
your higher self?

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I trust that we're going
to show up and meet today.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know the sun is
going to come up tomorrow.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I understand
the difference.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is working with it
and getting familiar enough

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with your higher
self yeses and nos,

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
so that when it's really
important, like you say,

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:90%
do I have this illness?

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Or should I stop
without a stoplight?

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Where you really
are feeling that,

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
you start to listen
for the clearer signs.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.387 align:middle line:84%
Just like anything, you
get used to it, right?

00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.187 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:47:06.187 --> 00:47:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
that if you spend

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
six weeks on a focused protocol,
just like an immersion,

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.220 align:middle line:84%
if you went into a
language course, right?

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.040 align:middle line:84%
You went and lived in
Mexico for six weeks.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.910 align:middle line:84%
You would come out of that
with absolute certainty

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of the voice of
the higher self, so

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that even in a
difficult situation,

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
you could stay with it and do
what your higher self says.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's bizarre.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I was driving down
the freeway one

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
time between two major cities,
headed home after a workshop.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And a semi went past me.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was told to
get behind the semi.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And when the semi took the
turn I was taking, I took it.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And then the semi landed--

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:90%
started driving on the berm.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And I asked again.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.055 align:middle line:84%
Higher self, am I supposed
to stay with that truck?

00:47:54.055 --> 00:47:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes, do it now.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And another car
came the other way,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
going the wrong way
on that interchange.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I would not have been able
to avoid that accident.

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But because I was so
close to the truck,

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.828 align:middle line:84%
the truck driver's
eyes were my eyes.

00:48:07.828 --> 00:48:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you listened.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And I listened.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:90%
But to me, it's not an option.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.517 align:middle line:84%
I made a commitment to
always follow my higher self.

00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm curious.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You as a mom, do you
teach your sons this?

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Do they listen to you?

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.413 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, it's
interesting that you say that.

00:48:21.413 --> 00:48:23.550 align:middle line:90%
They do listen quite a bit.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, there
was that rejection stage

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.190 align:middle line:90%
that we went through.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's normal.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
That's normal, right?

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the normal thing.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And when one of my boys was
little, he had only one kidney.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to teach him
to make a decision on what

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:90%
he should have to drink.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And there were lots of
choices in the refrigerator.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And he came back.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mom, my higher
self said no to everything.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did
you ask about water?

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And he said no.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.713 align:middle line:90%
So then he asked.

00:48:48.713 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And of course, he got water.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.297 align:middle line:84%
But he was one who had to be
careful what he was drinking.

00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to help
him to take responsibility.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you used this
to help raise your family.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:58.765 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I did.

00:48:58.765 --> 00:49:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had children before
everybody had cell phones.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.423 align:middle line:84%
So when they were at home,
I would ask my higher self,

00:49:03.423 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:84%
are they going to
be home on time?

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Are they OK?

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:07.913 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to be concerned?

00:49:07.913 --> 00:49:08.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Can I go to bed?

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I put a
note on the pillow.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Wake me up when you come in.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
What parent would let
themselves go to bed?

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I know.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.570 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've used this your whole
life and just teach people

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to work with it, so that
they become familiar

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.320 align:middle line:84%
with their own higher
self, which I really

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.790 align:middle line:84%
love that you
empower other people,

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
having people come

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.570 align:middle line:90%
to you for all the information.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.140 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.182 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Thank you.

00:49:37.182 --> 00:49:38.960 align:middle line:90%
I feel very strongly about that.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.978 align:middle line:84%
And even when people come to
me with important decisions,

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:44.270 align:middle line:84%
if I know they have a good
connection with their higher

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.450 align:middle line:84%
self, I will say to
them, you ask first.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And I will share
with you what I get.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And I will share with you
as soon as you tell me,

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.890 align:middle line:90%
but I'm your confirmation.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.664 align:middle line:90%
I'm not your teller.

00:49:53.664 --> 00:49:54.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:55.717 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're confirmation.

00:49:55.717 --> 00:49:57.763 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can also get
confirmation in life.

00:49:57.763 --> 00:49:59.180 align:middle line:84%
When you listen
to the higher self

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and you get a confirmation,
you do it again.

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, that's
what the six weeks is all about.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.968 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have
a history of your own

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that your higher self is
always right, you don't want--

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I always joke around and
say after your six weeks,

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.922 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
follow your higher self.

00:50:10.922 --> 00:50:13.380 align:middle line:84%
If your higher self tells you
something, you can ignore it,

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.960 align:middle line:90%
but you only do it once.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that one time
will be so obvious to you,

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:19.973 align:middle line:90%
you'll go, no point with this.

00:50:19.973 --> 00:50:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely going to
follow my higher self.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:84%
One time I was giving a lecture
and was told by my higher self.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.980 align:middle line:84%
No, you haven't been
following your higher self.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I go, what?

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they reminded me
of a relationship.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if you
get so far off track?

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you get back onto track?

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I think the
practice is all that matters.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you find
yourself off track,

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:48.200 align:middle line:84%
just take another six
weeks and do the protocol.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And then you know again.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And the protocol will
come back really fast.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if you get
answers you don't want to hear?

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
that's happened to me.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm married to my husband.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to marry him.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:59.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:59.110 --> 00:50:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.740 align:middle line:90%
He was a West Coast guy.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.115 align:middle line:90%
I want to be on the East Coast.

00:51:02.115 --> 00:51:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what if
it's the other way around?

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.975 align:middle line:84%
What if you're married and
your higher self says no, this

00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.850 align:middle line:90%
isn't appropriate?

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, you
don't ask that question,

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.922 align:middle line:84%
unless you're willing
to take that step.

00:51:12.922 --> 00:51:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't ask the
questions you don't

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.760 align:middle line:90%
want to hear the answers to?

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: No.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask a question you're
not willing to act on.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you do
want to ask the question.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:84%
You want to know the answer, but
are you willing to act on it?

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I tell people.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask the second
last question.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Ask the last question.

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is you don't
ask, is it going to rain today?

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You ask, is it in my highest and
best good to take an umbrella?

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's the last question.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.138 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask, is
it my highest, best

00:51:43.138 --> 00:51:44.180 align:middle line:90%
good to leave my husband?

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- that is
the last question.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:84%
If you want to ask, am
I good with this person?

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it good for me to leave him?

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it might be.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I also don't like the
phraseology, should I?

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of things we should do.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.543 align:middle line:84%
And your higher self doesn't
really care about "should."

00:51:59.543 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So I always insist that
you use this protocol.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.112 align:middle line:84%
Is it in my highest and
best good at this time?

00:52:04.112 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
question to ask?

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's
the question to ask.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this will get
you from third dimension

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to fifth dimension.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And you live pretty much in
the fifth dimension, right?

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I do.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But when
you fly and when

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you have to do things that
are grounded in the world,

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.150 align:middle line:84%
you're still in the
fifth dimension?

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.867 align:middle line:84%
And I am very fortunate,
because I have people

00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:29.030 align:middle line:90%
who show up that track me.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:35.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, a couple of
days ago, I was in a airport.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd come all the
way back from China.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had one more flight, but
it was a four-hour layover.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was busy in the
room with my computer.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm texting
with my book agent.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And she says, don't you have
to get on a plane right now?

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.610 align:middle line:90%
I've got plenty of time.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe I better check.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:90%
I ran and caught--

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:90%
I was the last one on the plane.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you have set it up.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So
what happens is

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:84%
you're so plugged
in, that even if you

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.815 align:middle line:84%
in your own consciousness
miss the mark,

00:53:06.815 --> 00:53:08.190 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody
out there going,

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:90%
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.953 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So you
attract that, you see?

00:53:12.953 --> 00:53:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
know everything.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.918 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: You don't
have to remember everything.

00:53:16.918 --> 00:53:19.610 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do is be
so centered and plugged

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:22.970 align:middle line:84%
in that what you need
comes to you, rather than--

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.332 align:middle line:90%
it's like the tractor, right?

00:53:24.332 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The tractor beam-- you want
it to come to you, rather

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.180 align:middle line:84%
than you trying to make it
happen and work so hard.

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So you just attract
it, so that it happens.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And you stay in the fifth
dimension to do that.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.878 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah, you can.

00:53:37.878 --> 00:53:39.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And life flows
really effortlessly.

00:53:39.805 --> 00:53:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: It does.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.535 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask you, because
I ask a lot of my guests

00:53:44.535 --> 00:53:46.790 align:middle line:84%
this question-- what
is your biggest why?

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Your biggest reason
why you do what you do?

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: What I have in
my world is my biggest "what."

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So I don't ask why,
because "why" is very 3D.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It chooses to evaluate.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So I like the "what" question,
which is, what's going on?

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And if everyone were
to train themself

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:13.400 align:middle line:84%
to ask that question, when
something happens that they

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that defies
the norm, whatever that norm is,

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.952 align:middle line:90%
they'll start learning a lot.

00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:21.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll start
learning what I know.

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:22.428 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's going on?

00:54:22.428 --> 00:54:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: What's going on?

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What kind of
answers would you get?

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, the first time

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that something happened
that I didn't understand

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:84%
about my missing "stuff,"
instead of saying,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.580 align:middle line:90%
where did it go?

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.478 align:middle line:84%
Like I used to, I asked the
question, what's going on?

00:54:37.478 --> 00:54:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, Maureen, you
were in a higher dimension

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.344 align:middle line:90%
when you put it down.

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, does it go beyond the
fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth,

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.560 align:middle line:90%
ninth?

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah, it does.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In your experience,
what did you see?

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: My
experience is that we have

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:90%
activity all the way to 12th.

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked about
13th, I was told--

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I asked, well, is
there anybody in 13?

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
a template, almost.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, well,
the construction crew

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:84%
is there, which I
thought was hilarious.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
still working on it.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And are there certain
dimensions where there is magic

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.513 align:middle line:84%
or things can
manifest themselves?

00:55:15.513 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: One of the
things I like to point people to

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is six is where we
have a lot of dreams.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we have dreams
that are pretty magical,

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.080 align:middle line:90%
that's sixth dimension.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, when we're in meditation,
let's say we go with a friend

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else is
leading the meditation,

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and we've "nodded off."

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.082 align:middle line:84%
And then we are
awake when it's over.

00:55:34.082 --> 00:55:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And your friends
poke and you say--

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and I can't believe
you fell asleep.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:39.530 align:middle line:90%
You didn't fall asleep.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
is the body has

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:45.240 align:middle line:84%
shut down all of the
external, extra stuff,

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.490 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
go really high.

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the way you know that
you didn't fall asleep,

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.753 align:middle line:90%
but that you were on--

00:55:51.753 --> 00:55:52.670 align:middle line:90%
there's a word for it.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:53.587 align:middle line:90%
But you're like pause.

00:55:53.587 --> 00:55:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
on low power mode,

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is you wake up
exactly when it ends.

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:07.680 align:middle line:10%
And I'll make the joke that
there is the internal engineer

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.740 align:middle line:10%
that's saying she's going deep.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.430 align:middle line:10%
Everybody go for coffee.

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:15.410 align:middle line:10%
We'll let you know when she's
coming back and when it's over.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And so you do.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the eighth and
beyond-- we don't remember.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the details.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.837 align:middle line:84%
So you can bring
back the information,

00:56:23.837 --> 00:56:25.670 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know what
you've brought back,

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.290 align:middle line:90%
until you start to unpack it.

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:29.897 align:middle line:84%
And that comes with more
meditation and opportunity.

00:56:29.897 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're actually
hearing all of it.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Even in our dream state,
we're absorbing it all.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.102 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Even
when you nod off,

00:56:35.102 --> 00:56:37.940 align:middle line:84%
if you wake up at the end of
a meditation, any meditation.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Because think about it.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.873 align:middle line:84%
When we watch the movies late
at night and we fall asleep,

00:56:41.873 --> 00:56:43.040 align:middle line:90%
something has to wake it up.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Honey, honey, it's over.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Time to go to bed.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the same.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But we do not necessarily
recall everything

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that we absorb in
our dream state

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.550 align:middle line:84%
in all these other
dimensional travels,

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:58.335 align:middle line:84%
because it wouldn't necessarily
help us in this dimension,

00:56:58.335 --> 00:56:58.690 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: No, it always
helps us in this dimension,

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.150 align:middle line:84%
but we don't always
understand it.

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:04.785 align:middle line:90%


00:57:04.785 --> 00:57:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even a dream
that you come back

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.105 align:middle line:90%
with-- it's confusing.

00:57:07.105 --> 00:57:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:90%
So the information is there.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.520 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes we're
getting it as a--

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.440 align:middle line:10%
I'll use the word packet.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And it isn't understandable
till we run it through code

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.340 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:20.585 align:middle line:90%
So it comes in.

00:57:20.585 --> 00:57:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And our own consciousness has to
work with it and filter it out.

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sort it.

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for teaching us

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.620 align:middle line:84%
about our highest
self and how to access

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.135 align:middle line:90%
that on a regular basis.
