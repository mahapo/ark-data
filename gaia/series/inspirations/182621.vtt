Could this person be you?

Did you know that
most people say

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the reason they don't
pursue their dreams

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is because of a lack
of money and time?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine if you could have
more of what you really want.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
take more time or money.

Why didn't you have a
someday in your life?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You know, it's
really interesting.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:10%
I owe this to my son
Andrew because I just

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
finished a very intensive
two-day consult. And he called.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And he sensed
something in my voice.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what's up?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, Andrew,
I'm so exhausted.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.525 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to get
on the plane tonight.

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Mom, there's
something about you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're your own boss.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
You have your own business.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You can do more of what
you want and you're not

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:90%
taking advantage of it.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, he's right.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I was just the old Puritan
work ethic-- work, work, work,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept putting
off what I really

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do until someday
when I had more time.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was never going
to happen, right, Lisa?

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.547 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You hear about
it all the time--

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
people that say,
well, retirement.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I'll wait till retirement
to have my dream house.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of
retirement, the pension's gone.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
The money's gone.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It's happening to
so many people.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: I used to
speak on cruise ships.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:10%
And I think one of the
saddest parts of that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:10%
were all the widows on board.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:10%
And see, Rene Ricard said,
tomorrow is another day,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:10%
but so was yesterday.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, so
many people put off

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
what they really want to
do with the expectation

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that it will be there
waiting for them.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And the person will be
there waiting for them

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:90%
when they're ready.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's not always the case.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have to seize
the moment, seize the day.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the, how can
you possibly stop working?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're an
independent business

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
owner, who's going to take over
the business while you're gone?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to answer the
phone if there's a problem?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to call in sick?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:90%
You?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.553 align:middle line:90%
You're the business owner.

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to call
in sick to yourself?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a challenge with most
people in independent business

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.763 align:middle line:84%
ownership entrepreneurs,
even working for a company.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: You know, it's true.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen the Gallup
poll that says 72% of people

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
are unhappy at work.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're unmotivated at work.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're not
doing anything about it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.108 align:middle line:84%
because they think there
aren't any options.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why what we're
going to focus on today

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is even if you're
taking care of parents

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
with dementia, even if you have
a family that you're raising,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
you have kids with
special needs,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
even if you're working two
jobs to pay off college debt,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
there are still things you
can do right here, right now

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to make your life more of
what you want it to be.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We need to learn that.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
thinking even people

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.568 align:middle line:84%
that-- because of the
job market being so tight

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
these days, people that do
have jobs that are employees

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
don't want to take that time
off necessarily because someone

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is right there
knocking on the door.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.223 align:middle line:84%
So this is an opportunity
for us to expand time.

00:03:49.223 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You know,
it's interesting

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
because employers
are actually watching

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
the statistics that show
that happy employees are

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:90%
loyal employees.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a bottom-line issue
these days to reduce turnover

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and to reduce the stress
that ends up in higher health

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:90%
costs--

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
is that insisting that
people take their vacations.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you know 52%
of Americans don't

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
take their full paid vacation?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.402 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 52%.

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: 52%.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet now businesses are
stepping up and saying,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
no, we want you to
take the weekend off.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We want you to
take that vacation,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
because they know
the cost of not doing

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
so is undermining performance
and productivity and eventually

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
profits.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And look at Europe.

There's time in the afternoon.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:90%
There's late starts to work.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:90%
There's full summers off.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You are
talking about what

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
we hope to flip in our
time here today, Lisa.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking everyone
watching this,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
fun is something

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
you do when your work is done?

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because see, if that is
part of your default,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
then if your work is never
done, you never have fun, right?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And George Bernard
Shaw said, we do not

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
stop playing
because we grow old.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We grow old because
we stop playing.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So play is not the
opposite of productivity.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It's part of productivity.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if you

Tell us a little bit about that.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:90%
This seems like a dream job.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Well, it is a dream job.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I do is that I'm

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
the pitch coach for
Springboard Enterprises, which

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
has helped women entrepreneurs
get $8.8 billion in funding.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
This is Robin Chase of

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:90%
of Constant Contact.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And Katharine Graham said

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:90%

So see, in a way, it is fun.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:90%
I was taking it to an extreme.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And our strength
taken to an extreme

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
is our Achilles heel
because I felt very needed.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I was constantly busy.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying yes because
I was in biz dev mode.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I finally had a
health wake-up call

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that got my attention
and helped me realize

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I needed to change things.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.638 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What happened?

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Almost every

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I bet you've dealt
with this, Lisa.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I had walking pneumonia.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But see, I kept
soldiering on, right?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It's because we
can't take time off.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:90%
We can't let people down, right?

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So for six weeks, I'm
in pretty bad health.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still jumping on planes.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm still doing
speaking engagements

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because I just felt
it was not an option

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:90%
to break a commitment.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor-- he diagnosed
the walking pneumonia.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're lucky.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to give you a Z-Pak.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
fine in 10 days.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:10%
But if you don't start
taking better care yourself,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:10%
your body is going
to do something more

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:10%
drastic to get your attention.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And that finally did
get my attention.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, you heard him.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're in
such a focused mode

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:90%
without any options.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't hear
that wake-up call.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: I'm so glad you
said-- because in a minute,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
my year by the water.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed people
around the United States.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And see, many of them think
they don't have options.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They say, you don't
understand my life.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of the house at 6:00.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't get back
until 7 o'clock.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand my life.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we had
a natural disaster.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
And our home's gone.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to talk about

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is that there really are
things that take like one hour

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
every two weeks that put
the light on in your eyes

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and make your life more of what
you want it to be now and not

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:90%
someday.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what inspired
you to take this year off

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:90%
by the water?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said, you
got this wake-up call.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
How did you actually
unhook into it?

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: You know, I wish that
I had acted on it right away.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's something called
an SEE, a Significant Emotional

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Event.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And even though I knew that
I had put my health at risk,

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
the rubber band of
routine snapped back.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And I went right back
into saying yes to clients

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
and filling my calendar.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was about a month later.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm driving along Pacific
Highway near Santa Barbara.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:90%
And an idea wants to be born.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know this
sounds a little crazy.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if I learned
anything in 17 years

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:84%
at the Maui Writers'
Conference, it's

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
ink it when you think it, right?

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:90%
So I pulled over.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is what came out, Lisa.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:90%
You can't make this stuff up.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like, some people
are drawn to fire.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I am drawn to water.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:10%
After all, we're 65% water.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:90%
All of us are bodies of water.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Yet water is a Maslow's
hierarchy overlooked need.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
We tend to take it for granted.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Water wants a voice.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Water needs a voice.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
So it is.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I will set out on my year
by the water on October 1.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.563 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what?

00:08:54.563 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who said that?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So I had a
calling downloaded

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:90%
with a name and a start date.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.605 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
finally set me off.

00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, the start date.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: My mom said, that which
can be done at any time rarely

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:10%
gets done at all.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk with people
now and they say, oh yeah,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.678 align:middle line:90%
someday I'm going to travel.

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Or someday I'm going
to write a book.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Or someday I'm going to
start running, or whatever,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
if you do not put a
day on the calendar,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Those days will
just keep moving on.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:90%
And it will just fade away.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm one of those people
with full-time work.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I have a teenager.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And my father's very
close to crossing.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So I don't see a someday.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I see micro moments.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I get moments.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how to
take a year off, Sam.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: See, I am so
glad you brought that up.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting
people take a year off.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Most people can't do that.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Or they don't want to do that.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
something precise.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the
happiness box, which we're

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
going to do in a
few minutes, here's

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
how anyone watching can
identify one specific thing they

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
can do this week that
is going to compensate

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of their life
that's out of control

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
happiness ripple effect.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we do one thing that
puts the light on in our eyes,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
it really can make up
for a lot of the things

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that we have to do that
we don't want to do.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:90%
You want an example?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.903 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: I'm imagining many
people watching have families

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
that they're taking care of.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
They're working full-time jobs.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%
As you say, they're busy.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're commuting
two hours a day.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So my son Tom is
all of the above.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
He's working long hours.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
He's got a couple of kids.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And now he and his wife admitted
that the romance was going out

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:90%
of their marriage a little bit.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And they admitted
that they like being

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:90%
outdoors hiking and so forth.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have time for that.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And they admitted that they
both wanted a little more time

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
for themselves because
they were always working

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:90%
or they're taking care--

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
so guess what Tom does
every Wednesday night?

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
He takes his two kids and the
neighbor kids out for a hike.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, he picks them up at 5:00.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They're back at
the house at 7:00.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It only takes two hours.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet all of these
things are happening.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Number one, Patty
gets a night off.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Number two, he gets outside
and does something he loves.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Number three, he's creating
memories with his kids.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
And it takes two hours max.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
he can do, once again,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that he looks at every week.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's one thing he can
point to that feels right

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
in his life.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do
every week that

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
feels right in your
life even with all

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:90%
these responsibilities?

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I exercise every morning
in my life, every morning.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And I need that.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I need that in my life.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It balances me.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So let's talk to
our viewers right now.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
You run.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, there are mornings
you're up late the night

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
before or the weather's not
so good or you're tired.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And it would be so easy for
you to make some excuse, right?

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'll run tomorrow.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I'll run when I'm not so tired.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll run when the sun comes out.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet you get up every
morning, and you run.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So what do you say
to yourself to make

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
this this non-negotiable
linchpin of your life?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great question.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything begins with one
step, one step, one step.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.838 align:middle line:90%
And then you're running.

00:12:28.838 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And then you're thinking.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.172 align:middle line:90%
And then you're feeling better.

00:12:31.172 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And then life is balanced again.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And it takes 40 minutes.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So see, listen to the
dialogue because one

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
of the things we're
mentioning to viewers today

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
is if it's vague,
it's not visceral,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
which means it's
not going to happen.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So you say to yourself,
it only takes 40 minutes.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
If you say to
yourself, I always feel

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
so good when I'm
finished running,

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:90%
it always sets up my day.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to suggest
that-- and this little box

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to work on in a
moment can help people identify

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And when those excuses
start coming up,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
we're either going to
have excuses or action.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
reasons or results.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
If they have dialogue, something
they say to themselves that

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
focuses on the results
instead of the reasons,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that focuses on the actions
instead of the excuses,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
it will help them take that one
step, which leads to another

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.367 align:middle line:90%
and another and another.

00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yeah.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So being more specific,
did you do that when

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.933 align:middle line:90%
you did your year on the water?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Well,
here's the good news

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
about it-- is that I
was clear I wanted to do

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of my always.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, see, for many of
us, it's responsibility

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
from the moment we get up
to the moment we go to bed.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So see, maybe the hour
we take for ourselves--

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's not selfish to
put ourselves in our own story

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
for an hour every week--

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
maybe that is no responsibility.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that is not having
to make decisions.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that is not planning.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I did on my
year by the water--

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
instead of controlling
it and planning it,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I cooperated with what
wanted to show up.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And I partnered
with it because see,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:10%
that was the contrast
to my always,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:10%
which really made
it more fun for me

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.035 align:middle line:10%
because it wasn't something
that I was accustomed to doing.

00:14:16.035 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you mean, put
yourself in your own story?

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Oh, boy.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does That mean?

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: When you said at
the beginning of the show

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that many people
feel they are not

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
doing what they want because
they don't have enough time

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
or money, guess what the
number-one reason is people

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
don't do what they want?

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:10%
They feel it's selfish.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I have all these
people counting on me.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't just go
gallivanting off.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I would let someone
down if I said no to them,

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the
line, it was modeled for us.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It was taught to us that
we put other people first,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that the noble thing,
the right thing,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the caring, compassionate
thing is to think of others

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and to take ourselves
out of our own story.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Do we have time for a
quick story about that?

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: I had a very good
friend who came to my home

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:10%
and, when it was time for me
to leave, helped me figure out,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.568 align:middle line:10%
what am I going to give away?

00:15:13.568 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:10%
What am I going to keep?

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:10%
And so we're fixing breakfast.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at
my refrigerator.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And she beckons me over.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Sam, look
at the refrigerator.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:90%
She said, what's on it?

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were pictures of
the boys-- boys playing Little

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
League, and the
boys going to prom,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and the boys going
off to Virginia Tech.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And guess what wasn't on
the refrigerator, Lisa?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Pictures of me.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
See, there weren't pictures
of me on book tours.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
There weren't pictures
of me speaking.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that many
of us define ourselves

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:10%
as a parent even when our
kids are out of the house.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: They say, how are you?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And we start telling them
how our kids are doing.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It is not selfish to put
ourself in our own story.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It is inspiring.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you actually
put yourself in the story.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And what did you do?

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.145 align:middle line:90%
Who did you meet?

00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us a little bit about
that because it's really great.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You know, I
sailed the Chesapeake Bay

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:90%
with Captain Jan.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I swam with Zack the dolphin.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I watched whales
breach off Maui.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to Monet's garden
and took a photography water

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:90%
workshop.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
interesting, though,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
because people ask
me about the places.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about the places.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:90%
It was about the people.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.375 align:middle line:90%
In particular, once again--

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
do we have time
for another story?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So I'm at Seacliff
Beach in Aptos, California.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm working on my book.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And the sun clears.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:90%
The clouds go away.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's time
to get out for a walk.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm walking along
Seacliff Beach.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And two women pop
out of their trailer.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, would
you take our picture?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I will if
you tell me your story.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they lived in
Fresno a few hours away.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And June had looked at
her friend and said,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
we've got to get away.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:90%
And she said, we can't.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.355 align:middle line:84%
It's your son's
birthday next week.

00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And then your
daughter graduates.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't have time.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
She said, if we don't do it
now, we're never going to do it.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:10%
So they told their family
they'd be back on Sunday.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And they hooked
up their trailer.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
And there they were
at Seacliff Beach.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
gave you clarity

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that even though you're busy,
even though you have families,

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
important occasions
coming up, you still

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:90%
were going to do this?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And June said, I'm
an insurance agent.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, one of
my clients waited

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:90%
until he was 70 to retire.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he bought that big,
old Winnebago he had always

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:90%
been talking about.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, bring it over to
the office so I can look at it.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll add it
to your account.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:90%
She said, it was 2 o'clock.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't there.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:90%
2:15, he wasn't there.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
She looked out the window.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:10%
He was there.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to park
that dog-gone Winnebago.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.635 align:middle line:84%
It took him 20
minutes to park it.

00:17:58.635 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he had a
hard time getting out

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
move very well.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And she said, he came in.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And he slammed the door.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And he plopped
down on the chair.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
waited too damn long.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I promised
myself we're not

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
going to wait to do the things
we want to do because that's

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:90%
a path to regrets.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great story.

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And you hear about
it all too often.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this is such
an important topic of,

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
someday is not a
day in the week.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Someday is today.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do that?

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
This is based on something
that Paulo Coelho said.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, one day we're
going to wake up,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and there won't be any time left
to do the things we've always

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
However, I have a friend
who spoke at a graduation.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
She gave the
commencement address.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was a smaller college.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And after the ceremonies, all
the grads got up on stage.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And with great
fanfare, they tore open

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:90%
their graduation robes.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were all wearing
T-shirts that said,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, because
a lot of people--

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what
they want to do, right?

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It's been so long since
they've had the freedom.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And Dan Pink says that when
many people-- you ask them

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%
what they want to do.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They think they have
to say something like,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:90%
feed the orphans of the world.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be grandiose.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
a year by the water.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be something that's--

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Serena Williams was just on
the cover of "Time" magazine.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Here she is, probably one of
the best athletes of the last 20

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:90%
She's got a lot of money, right?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But do you know what she
had not done for a while

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
because she felt guilty not
being there for her daughter?

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:84%
For her, it was
getting her nails done.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It takes a half an
hour once a week.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And here she is, a famous
celebrity, all the money

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and yet she
felt guilty about leaving

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
her daughter even for half
an hour to get the nails.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So see, it can be
something that's

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
just simple but meaningful
to us that makes

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
us feel we're putting
ourself in our story

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
instead of putting everyone
else first and ourselves last.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I see
here from these pictures

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.176 align:middle line:84%
we're about to show that
you went to Burning Man

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:90%
with your son, which is great.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
What was the
inspiration behind that?

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: You know, my son
invited me to go to Burning Man.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that I think--
did we quote George Bernard

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Shaw already, who said,
we don't stop playing

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:90%
because we've become old.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:10%
We become old because
we stop playing.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And some people-- I've heard,
Sam, you're in your 60s.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:90%
You went to Burning Man?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, but
that's party central.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Excuse me.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
You're in your 60s?

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: And the thing is, it's
like, I believe you do the new.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
This was an adventure.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe life is supposed
to be an adventure.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:84%
My son was gracious
enough to ask me

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and to help make it happen.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:90%
So why would I not go?

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, do you know what I
remember about Burning Man?

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: The gentleness of it.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I got up at dawn.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:10%
And I rode out into
the desert on my e-bike

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:10%
and saw the sun rise
over the mountains.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw art installations
that were just

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%
creativity personified.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I was surrounded by people
one night at sunset.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Here comes a German couple
with Cristal champagne.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Here comes a woman
quoting Jack Kerouac.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Here comes a gentleman singing.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't I do
something like that?

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how we can do this.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about the box.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no mystery to it.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:90%
We have the answers to the test.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is the happiness box.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And unless your
viewers are driving,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I hope they get out
a piece of paper

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.427 align:middle line:84%
and they actually do
this box because it

00:21:56.427 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:90%
takes less than two minutes.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a box in four quadrants.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
That upper-left box-- just
put a number one in there.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the upper-right
quadrant is two.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Lower left is three.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And lower right is four.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to ask a question.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I hope our viewers will
write down the first thing that

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
comes to mind.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't censor it.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge it.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
If your gut tells you,
it's probably true.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So box number one, what
are you doing in your life

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:90%
that you want to?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.748 align:middle line:90%
So think about your health.

00:22:28.748 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing in your
life that you want to?

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Going for a run?

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Think about your relationships.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
that you want to?

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Tom's going on a
hike once a week.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So what are you doing in
your life that you want to?

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Box number two, what are
you not doing in your life

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that you want to?

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.415 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to write a
book, and you're not doing it.

00:22:49.415 --> 00:22:50.215 align:middle line:90%
Put it down.

00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe I
want to sleep more.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: You see, that's right.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to get
eight hours of sleep,

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and you're not doing it.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So it can be
something very simple.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who
wanted to play the piano.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, she doesn't have
time to play the piano.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Box number three, what are you
doing that you don't want to?

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.715 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're working 60 hours
a week, and you don't want to.

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You know what the most
frequently given answer

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
is in box three?

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Social media.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
What people are doing
that they don't want to is

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
they're spending all
this time scrolling.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
unhappiness ripple

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
effect, where they're
scrolling and they're

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:90%
comparing themselves.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And they feel more and more
bad because everyone else

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
is out there and having a
great time, and they're not.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.938 align:middle line:84%
So see, it actually
de-energizes you, right?

00:23:36.938 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
doing you don't want?

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're fighting
with your spouse.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, box four-- ready?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.612 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: What are you not
doing and you don't want to?

00:23:47.612 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, I know that's a double--

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.835 align:middle line:84%
I see the English teacher in you
is going, double negative, Sam.

00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:52.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Double negative.

00:23:52.835 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So see, maybe
someone used to smoke.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And they quit.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And they're not smoking anymore.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:90%
See, our clarity in box four--

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:90%
those are our lessons learned.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I used to do that.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I used to commute
two hours a day.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to do it anymore.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I moved into the city.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Now I take the subway to work.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And it really has
improved my life.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So now you get a job offer,
but you have to commute.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And see, your clarity
about box four

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
prevents you from
the slippery slope

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of going back into what
once made you unhappy.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I could absolutely
understand that.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So once we get all this
together, what does it mean?

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Now take your pen or pencil.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Circle the answers in box one.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Circle the answers in box four.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what's contributing
to your quality of life.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what helps you have
a life that feels right.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Once again, back
to your running,

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:90%
you're doing what you want.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You're running.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's this lead
domino in your happiness.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's contributing.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:90%
So I am.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing that.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm exercising every day.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I don't want to
do that I'm no longer doing

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
is driving--

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:90%
two hours a day--

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:90%
my daughter to school.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
No longer ever happening again.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So see, your clarity prevents it
from sliding back in your life.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It helps you have the certainty
and clarity to say no to it,

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Now let's
circle the answers

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:90%
in box two and box three.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is compromising
our quality of life.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes us feel
that life is dissonant or wrong

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:90%
or not what we want it to be.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what am I not doing?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And what do I not want to do?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: It's, what are you
not doing that you want to?

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
that you don't want to?

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do you
know anyone who's perfect?

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.302 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:25:49.302 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: I don't either.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So see--

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.703 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I try, but
it never works.

00:25:52.703 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So see,
we're always going

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to have things in box
two and three, right?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:90%
The question is, how long?

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
John Foster Dulles
said, the mark

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of a successful organization
isn't whether or not

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:90%
it has problems.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It's whether it has the
same problems last year.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
See, this is where
some days lurk.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I interview
people, the things they're

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:90%
putting in box two and three--

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
they haven't just been going
on for weeks or months.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.330 align:middle line:90%
They've been going on for years.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We have the answers to the
test, and yet we keep floating.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Henry Miller said, life as it
is called is for most of us

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%
one long postponement.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
procrastination, putting off--

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, could this actually
solve procrastination?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: See-- and I know
I'm throwing quotes out.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just there are some
good ones out there, Lisa.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Judy Tenuta said,
my parents always

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:84%
told me I wouldn't amount
to anything because I

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:90%
procrastinated so much.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I told them, just you wait.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, see, box two or three
are what we're waiting to do,

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which is why the name
of my book is "Someday

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:90%
is Not a Day in the Week."

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So let's be proactive.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
My whole goal-- I'm a
woman on a mission--

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is to help people get
crystal clear even

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
about one thing that would
put the light on in their eyes

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
because this is an
indication of doing something

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that we like or love that is
the linchpin to a happier,

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:90%
healthier life.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
One thing a week, once again,
can compensate for the risk.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:10%
We put a date on the calendar.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we do it, which energizes
us to do more of what we want.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
we look around.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And our life is better than it
has been in months or years.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the date on
the calendar is the key.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.525 align:middle line:84%
If you keep wanting to
do things and know what

00:27:48.525 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is the right thing
to do, but you

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
don't do it, it's because
there's not a "by when."

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So my question
around that is, what

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
happens when you push that
"by when" or you ignore that

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:90%
"by when"?

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Can you redeem yourself?

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Wow.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.613 align:middle line:90%
What a great question.

00:28:04.613 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do it a lot.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I put things in my calendar.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:90%
And then I don't have time.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of
override the calendar.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Boy, Lisa.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I believe in making
promises to ourselves.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just saw something
in "The Wall Street Journal"

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
LeBron James is
starting schools.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
they're called?

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I make promises schools.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're called.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And every single day, they
make a promise to themselves

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:84%
about what they're going to do
in school, what kind of person

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:10%
So see, I agree with
you that we want

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:10%
to make a reasonable promise.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a pie-in-the-sky
promise that's not feasible.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And even when we say it, we
know we're not going to do it.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It's simple enough that
we promise ourselves

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that when the time
comes, we will do that.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a quick story
about that if we have time.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.227 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:59.227 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: I lived in a community
with 20 pools and a lake.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.065 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't swimming.

00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you love water.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Well, I love water.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be a
competitive swimmer.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And it all changed
one day when I--

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
it's like, 7 o'clock
in the morning.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And I hear these cheers.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:10%
And I think it must be
a swim team at the pool.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:10%
No, they were having a
mile race, a national race,

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:10%
on the lake in my backyard.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:90%
So I got up.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And I went over.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.655 align:middle line:90%
And I checked it out.

00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And here go the
30 and somethings.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Here go the
40-and-somethings, 50, 60,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.887 align:middle line:90%
the 80-and-over age group.

00:29:40.887 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, I'm thinking,
what is my excuse?

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
The 80-and-somethings
are swimming in this.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
So I walked home.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I jumped online.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I googled the Waikiki
Roughwater Swim

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:84%
because I used to do that
when I was in Hawaii.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I registered on the spot
because see, once you register,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:90%
now you've made a commitment.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:90%
And you reverse.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to train a certain
amount of miles every week,

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
or else I'm going
to embarrass myself.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just like
getting on a flight.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:90%
You know when the fight is.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
You reverse engineer
getting on that flight.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:90%
So you did that.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:84%
You reverse engineered
what you needed

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.752 align:middle line:90%
to do to make that swim happen.

00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:17.552 align:middle line:90%
Did you do it?

00:30:17.552 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: I absolutely did it.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of side
stories to that--

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
two weeks before the race,
my son Andrew says, Mom,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I think I want to do it, too.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, but
you haven't trained.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.877 align:middle line:90%
He finished before I did.

00:30:28.877 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And my son Tom was
there with his crew.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And see, when we look
back at our life, Lisa,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:90%
do we want regrets?

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Or do we want results?

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And that was a result. When I
look back on my life, right now

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:10%
I can remember what it was
like crossing that finish line.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was both of my sons
and some family friends there.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Life is not supposed
to be a burden.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be a blessing.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And our happiness
is in our hands.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And each of us can do
something today, a little thing

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll look back.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And we'll think, I
made that a good day.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in business, usually
there are productivity charts

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
and "by whens" and deadlines.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole team of
people that make those happen.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
You get that to happen in
a business environment.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't have
a team around you?

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.068 align:middle line:84%
You seem like you have a great
relationship with your sons,

00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:90%
which is fantastic.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:90%
But what if you don't?

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you need accountability
partners around you

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.657 align:middle line:84%
in a someday situation
when we set something

00:31:38.657 --> 00:31:39.740 align:middle line:90%
that we really want to do?

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Do we need help?

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Absolutely we need help.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And I believe in communities.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
a shortened story here.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Suffice it to say,
I'm in Morro Bay.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And here comes a
replica ship in.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have an opportunity
to interview Ray Ashley,

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:90%
the head of this replica ship.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And what he was telling me is
they made a crucial decision.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I think you know this because
you're from the San Diego area

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
They decided to build the ship
in public instead of private.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Instead of building
this ship out

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:84%
in some industrial
warehouse, they

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
built it right by the
San Diego freeway.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And within the first week,
they had 50 volunteers.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:90%
They had neurosurgeons.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:90%
They had shipbuilders.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And over the next
two years, they

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:90%
would run into an obstacle.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
All the wood that they
used, one-of-a-kind wood,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
rotted when they
put the epoxy on it.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:84%
One of their volunteers said,
well, I know a wood expert.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk to him.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:90%
He donated the wood they needed.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have enough
lead for the hull.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a get the lead out
campaign to get the community

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:90%
to support him.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
People are bringing in their
ball bearings and so forth.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of their
volunteers says, you know,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I worked for a contractor
out in the Valley.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's call him.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He donated 80,000
pounds of lead.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And that ship was finished
because of the community

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:90%
support.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So by all means, instead
of trying to go it alone,

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
especially if maybe we
don't have the discipline

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
or we have some habits
of putting things off

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're not good at holding
ourselves accountable,

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
find someone who wants
the best for you.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Find someone or a
community at work

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:84%
who believes in this project,
who is also committed

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to this mission, who
wants to see this

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:84%
finished so that you are jumping
on other people's bandwagon

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of having
to do it yourself.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:90%
So say you are accountable.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And you set out to do something.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And you are all
excited about it.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.565 align:middle line:90%
And you hit your "by when."

00:33:35.565 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
problem, like the ship

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:43.370 align:middle line:84%
builder, where somebody else got
that job you were looking for.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Things happen all the time--

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:84%
How do we be adaptable to
when our someday gets spoiled?

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: We ask for help.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:10%
You know, Lisa, my mom had
a slow-growing brain tumor

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:10%
for years.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.950 align:middle line:10%
And I could put my hand
on the back of her neck

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and feel the pain radiating
out from her neck.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.719 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, Mom, can
I go ahead and fix dinner?

00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:90%
And she would say, no, thanks.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I've got it, because she didn't
want to be a burden on us.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
And the things she was
teaching us, though,

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:84%
was not to ask for help
or not to accept help.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It's to be strong, to do it
yourself, to soldier through.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.949 align:middle line:90%
I love and I bless my mom.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that sometimes we
got this lesson along the way.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask for help.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.060 align:middle line:90%
And don't accept it.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We sure did Yeah.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: And Lisa, as you know,
if something isn't working out

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the way we want it to
be, instead of soldiering

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.360 align:middle line:84%
on, instead of continuing
to go solo, with grace,

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:90%
ask for and accept help.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It is something that
we did get handed down from

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:10%
generations before us--

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:10%
to do it alone or do it
yourself and not ask for help.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is the generation
of, ask for help

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:84%
because there's plenty of
people who want to help you.

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, when you
don't ask for help,

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:90%
it gets confusing to people.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have a great
saying in business.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Confused people don't say yes.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Well, I
had the opportunity

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to help start and
run the Maui Writers'

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Conference for 17 years.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And we did something
unprecedented at the time.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We gave authors from
around the world

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to jump
the chain of command.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You could pitch your
screenplay to Ron Howard.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You could pitch your novel
to the head of Doubleday.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Where else are you going
to get that opportunity?

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.145 align:middle line:84%
These decision makers would
say, what's your book about?

00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Wah wah, wah wah,
wah wah, wah wah.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:84%
See, they did not know how
to distill the value of what

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:84%
it was they had created
into a 60-second pitch

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.843 align:middle line:90%
so people's eyebrows went up.

00:35:51.843 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the things I help

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.480 align:middle line:90%
people do with in business.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:90%
What is your dream?

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
want to set in motion?

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Now how can we communicate
it so cleanly and crisply

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and compellingly that
anybody gets it and wants it?

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you help people with
not an elevator speech, but a--

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.160 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: I call it
an elevator intro,

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
because do you know anyone who
likes listening to a speech?

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like Bette Midler said.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember the movie
"Wings" by any chance?

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Enough about me.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about me?

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And elevator speeches are even
like, I help blank do blank.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a speech.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to
be dialogues, right?

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
be meeting people

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in a way that actually
leads to a mutually

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:90%
rewarding conversation.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So I've created a whole new
way to do elevator intros.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.848 align:middle line:84%
And we can share it with
your viewers if you'd like.

00:36:46.848 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So this applies to
anyone, by the way.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:84%
This is if you're
a parent and you're

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to talk to your
kids about something.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to present
an idea to a school board,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.580 align:middle line:84%
if you're anything, if you're
at work, any role in life,

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:90%
this helps.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter what you do.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.733 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's true.

00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
if you're a parent

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and you have an
idea that you want

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to bring up at the PTA
meeting, if you're involved

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:84%
in your community
association and this

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is the annual
association meeting

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.970 align:middle line:84%
or something like that-- so
any time you have an idea

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
or you have something that
you want to get funded

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:84%
or that you have something
you want support for

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.960 align:middle line:84%
or to get approved,
you can use this idea.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:90%
So the 60-second story.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to give
the technique that people

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:90%
can actually use, OK?

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So as you mentioned, I was the
pitch coach for Springboard.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So one of my Springboard
clients came to me.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Sam, I've got good
news, and I've got bad news.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the good news?

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.210 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm speaking in
front of a roomful of investors

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:90%
at the Paley Center in New York.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's fantastic.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the bad news?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm going at
2:30 in the afternoon.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And I only have 10 minutes.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.590 align:middle line:84%
She said, you can't say
anything in 10 minutes.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, Kathleen, you
don't have 10 minutes.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:90%
You have 60 seconds.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Here's a 60-second
opening we came up with.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
She not only got
millions in funding.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.970 align:middle line:84%
She was selected "Business
Week's" most promising

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:90%
social entrepreneur of 2010.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:90%
That's impressive.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: Did you know there are
1.8 billion vaccinations given

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:10%
every year?

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Did you know up to
a third of those

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:90%
are given with reused needles?

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:10%
Did you know we're
spreading and perpetuating

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:10%
the very diseases we're
trying to prevent?

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if there were a
painless, one-use needle

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
for a fraction of
the current cost.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to imagine it.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.757 align:middle line:90%
We've created it.

00:38:49.757 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:90%
And she's off and running.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Are your eyebrows up?

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Do you
want to know more?

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.577 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: That means she just
got what she cared about

00:38:56.577 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
in your mental door.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is Kathleen
Callender of PharmaJet.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Guess how she used to
explain what PharmaJet was.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.027 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: It's a medical
delivery device

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:90%
for subcutaneous inoculations.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:90%
A what?

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:11.810 align:middle line:90%
A what?

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:84%
See, confused people
don't say yes.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Same entity.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.340 align:middle line:84%
However, one, you
want to know more.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.645 align:middle line:84%
The other, you're already
checking your digital device.

00:39:21.645 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're just hearing
out of the corner

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:90%
of your eye, wah wah, wah wah.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And you want to find out
more about the next speaker.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's exactly right

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she was
successful in her--

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:84%
so how do you teach people
to take what it is they do

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and intrigue people no matter
if they're interested or not?

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You know,
we connect the dots.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.600 align:middle line:90%
And so here is how people can--

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of explaining
something, which is infobesity.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you try
and explain something,

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.080 align:middle line:84%
our goal is to introduce
it an intriguing way

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:90%
so the eyebrows go up.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.200 align:middle line:90%
So here's another example.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it shows people how
instead of explaining what

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:84%
PharmaJet is--
subcutaneous [MUTTERING]..

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.280 align:middle line:90%
So here's another example.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
called the "dolphin tank."

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am a kinder, gentler
version of the "Shark Tank."

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.193 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's what
the dolphin tank is.

00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:13.993 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:13.993 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: So I'm looking at the
business plans of the people

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:90%
who are competing in this.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And here's a woman.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying to get funding
for a hook you put in your car

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to put your purse on.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, really?

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:90%
She was so smart, Lisa.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the Long Beach
Convention Center.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
up and saying,

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I have an idea, a hook
you put into-- no, no.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
She hauled a
full-sized car seat up

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to the front of the ballroom.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.400 align:middle line:84%
She put her hands on an
imaginary driving wheel.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
She said, have you ever
been driving along,

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you had to stop all of a
sudden, and your purse fell off?

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And your keys and your--

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and you're rummaging around.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And you're trying to drive.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
She said, imagine never
having to do that again.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman stood
up in the audience.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:10%
He said, I'll take two-- one for
my wife, one for my daughter.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, she went from,
really, to, I'll take two,

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:10%
in 30 seconds because she
asked instead of explained.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And she put us in the scene
of the problem she solved so

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:90%
that we were experiencing it.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we socratically wanted
which she was selling.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And 30 seconds, and
we'll say, I'll take two.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Was the hook on the back
over the back of the seat?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Actually,
it's called Cargo.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.550 align:middle line:84%
By all means, it's still
online and so forth.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of fancy, yeah.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:84%
On the back of your
seat, it's just

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.070 align:middle line:90%
kind of a fancy silver hook.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a lot
of people do use it

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking
before about how

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.320 align:middle line:90%
we hold ourselves accountable.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.800 align:middle line:84%
If we just say, I'm not going
to take my eyes off the road,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
well, let's be a
little preventative.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's put our purse
and our cell phone

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.140 align:middle line:84%
out of reach over there so
it's not going to happen.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.378 align:middle line:84%
So we prevent something that
could create an accident.

00:42:01.378 --> 00:42:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's behind
the passenger seat--

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's exactly right.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --which is
brilliant because there

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:10.010 align:middle line:84%
have been a lot of thefts
recently at stoplights.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And people just reach
in and grab purses--

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's right.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --at least where I am.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: And so for our viewers--

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and if they're thinking, well, I
have an idea, don't explain it.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Either ask three
did-you-know questions--

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and if you're thinking,
Sam, how do I find out

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:84%
these startling statistics
that get people's eyebrows up,

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:90%
you GTS that stuff.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, you know what GTS is?

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: Well, for us boomers,
it's Google That Stuff.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
For millennials,
fill in the blank.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you, if
you go online right now

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and put in search what
are startling statistics

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:84%
about the industry that you're

creating or the issue
you're addressing,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.940 align:middle line:84%
up will come things
even you don't know.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And see, if you don't know
it and you introduce it,

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that's a quick way
to get intrigued

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because now people are smarter
than they were 10 seconds ago.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So you can Google search
startling statistics.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: When I do
workshops on this, Lisa,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:90%
it has never failed.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if you are doing
something around dog obedience.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if you're doing
something around home security.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:10%
I don't care.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:84%
There will be
statistics that go, wow,

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was that bad.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I didn't know
it was that much.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was
increasing that fast.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is a shortcut
to taking someone who's

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:90%
distracted and overwhelmed.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And they're thinking, wow.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Then use the word
"imagine" because imagine

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.430 align:middle line:90%
this and this and this.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Now you are painting
a word picture

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
where people are seeing
what you're saying.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking,
who wouldn't want that?

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wrote that
way in the beginning

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of this intro as an honor to
you because you taught me this.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And I love this.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It's how I start a
lot of my shows--

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:90%
is, did you know?

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So it helps people
say, yeah, me.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, raise my hand.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Pick me.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm that person.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then "imagine if," which
offers a forward-paced solution

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to whatever it is that
you're talking about.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And then here's how.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I have taken that on as
the bible for all of my shows

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.800 align:middle line:90%
and how I do the intros.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: See, Lisa, you get this.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Think about the multifaceted
benefits of this.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
As you say, you just
turned a 60-second intro

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:84%
into a dialogue
instead of a monologue

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:84%
because by asking
instead of explaining,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.345 align:middle line:84%
you're engaging instead
of telling, right?

00:44:31.345 --> 00:44:32.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:32.145 --> 00:44:32.945 align:middle line:90%
You're enrolling.

00:44:32.945 --> 00:44:35.627 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: And furthermore, you're
taking someone who thinks,

00:44:35.627 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I may not be interested in this.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:90%
How is this relevant for me?

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:90%
And you are making it pertinent.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.620 align:middle line:90%
I have a new saying.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be perfect.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:90%
We just have to be pertinent.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like it.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is great if
anyone has a business.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if you're
going to a networking

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:84%
event or a social
gathering or anything?

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.372 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: We've been taught to
give elevator speeches, right?

00:44:59.372 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like when someone
says, what do you do do,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.140 align:middle line:84%
which is the ubiquitous
way of greeting people.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what do we do?

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.700 align:middle line:10%
Wah wah, wah wah,
wah wah, wah wah.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So I've come up
with a different way

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to introduce ourselves
that actually does create

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.830 align:middle line:84%
a meaningful connection
and conversation instead

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of this monologue.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:90%
So are you ready?

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: OK.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So a quick story, and then
we'll do the technique.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking at Inc. 500.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And here are the top
entrepreneurs in the country.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.417 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked Colleen,
who's entrepreneur

00:45:30.417 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:90%
of the year for Oklahoma--

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you do?

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Wah wah, wah wah, wah wah.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, can we play?

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And she said, OK.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you do
or what do you care about

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have a
business that we can see,

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:48.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can smell, that we can
taste, or that we can touch?

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not going to
try and explain electricity.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We want to talk about
something that people can see.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I run
the medical facilities

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:90%
that offer MRIs and CAT scans.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, great.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't say that.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.658 align:middle line:90%
She said, don't say that?

00:46:03.658 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, because if people
ask you, you tell them.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:90%
They go, oh.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.407 align:middle line:90%
Conversation's over.

00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to end
the conversation.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We want to open
the conversation.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So I said, turn it into
a three-part question.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anyone--

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:84%
could be yourself, a
friend, or family member--

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.310 align:middle line:90%
who's had an MRI or a CAT scan?

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Now put a sock in it.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other person's going to
say, oh, yeah, my daughter hurt

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:28.810 align:middle line:90%
her knee playing soccer.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:90%
She had an MRI.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Now you just link what you
do to what they just said.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I run the facilities
that offer MRIs

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.620 align:middle line:10%
like the one your daughter had
when she hurt her knee playing

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.820 align:middle line:10%
soccer.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the lights go on.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And the band play.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Now they relate to what we do.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.760 align:middle line:90%
They've had experience.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And now we're probably off on
an interesting conversation

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:10%
instead of just, oh.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Can we play?

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.700 align:middle line:90%
We can play.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I host shows
about conscious media.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Wah wah, wah wah.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.946 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:05.946 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:90%
How can I turn that into--

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.417 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.417 --> 00:47:12.750 align:middle line:90%
People are like, conscious what?

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:13.210 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: Do you know
what Diane Keaton says?

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: She said her
biggest lesson learned

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:90%
was, it's not about you.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.520 align:middle line:90%
It never was.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So see, here's how we do
that-- is not, I do this.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Question, do you know anyone--

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.850 align:middle line:84%
could be yourself, could be
a friend or a family member--

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.560 align:middle line:84%
who's interested in
consciousness raising?

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Now give three
specific examples,

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.030 align:middle line:84%
like they'd like to know more
about how they could improve

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
their health, like they would
like to know more about how

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:84%
they could create a
community, like they'd

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:84%
like to know more about how
they can enjoy their life.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Now you stop talking
because they're either going

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to go, well, that would be me.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I would love to do this, or they
would say, I hate that stuff.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.010 align:middle line:84%
My sister is talking
about it all the time.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So see, they are
going to give you

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.820 align:middle line:84%
free information, a hook on
which to hang a conversation.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Because if they say, well,
I'm not into that stuff,

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:84%
but my sister talks
about it all the time,

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.460 align:middle line:90%
say, well, you know what?

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And they may say,
she's especially into--

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you have Dr. Jo on
talking about coherency and so

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.390 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:24.600 align:middle line:84%
She's especially into how
everything's connected

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and how important it is to
connect dots and so forth.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:84%
See, then you go, oh, well,
I help facilitate shows

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that your sister likes
to watch about how

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.140 align:middle line:90%
we can connect the dots.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Now she may go back and tell
her sister about her show.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And do you see how in 60
seconds you genuinely connected?

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is meaningful
to someone they care about.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.772 align:middle line:90%
It may not be them.

00:48:49.772 --> 00:48:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
helpful because it's

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:90%
better than a business card.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it connects people
to the true meaning

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that you do and
the why and the bigger why.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: And see, we can
always tailor it, Lisa.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You're so quick on your feet.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:90%
See, you may be around people.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And you may have three recent
shows that you want to market.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So you would say, well, I
facilitate and host shows

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.320 align:middle line:90%
on blank, blank, blank.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're
interested, they're

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:84%
coming up in the
next couple of weeks,

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:90%
which increases the likelihood.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So we always customize to the
situation and to the person

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and to our goals and the
outcomes we would like.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a great story about
a man who was an engineer,

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.350 align:middle line:90%
was he?

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Yes.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a good-old techie
out of Silicon Valley.

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was at YPO at the
YPO University in Ireland.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And he came up to me
before my session.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.378 align:middle line:84%
He said, Sam, I'm going to
confess something to you.

00:49:46.378 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't tell many people.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm an introvert.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.660 align:middle line:90%
He said, I run a company.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually kind
of shy, though.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I fly around the world
to these conferences.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I hang out in my hotel
room because I hate hall talk.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, chit
chat-- not my thing.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I can never
explain what I do in a way

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that people get it.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.220 align:middle line:90%
It's so awkward.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I just avoid it.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you want to play?

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to play?

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: And I said, OK.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.370 align:middle line:90%
So don't tell me what you do.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:17.810 align:middle line:84%
What are the results of
what you do that we can see

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.090 align:middle line:90%
or smell or taste or touch?

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, he's saying something
about computers, credit cards,

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:90%
financial software.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Finally my light bulb goes off.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you make the
software that makes it safe

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.360 align:middle line:90%
for us to buy things online?

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.455 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:50:33.455 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, now, don't tell
people that because they're

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.750 align:middle line:90%
going to go, oh.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Turn it into a three-part
question and stack the deck.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are the three most
successful online retailers

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:50.165 align:middle line:84%
It was Travelocity,
eBay, and Amazon.

00:50:50.165 --> 00:50:52.040 align:middle line:10%
So do you know anyone--
it could be yourself,

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.750 align:middle line:10%
friend, or family
member-- who shops

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:10%
online like on Travelocity,
eBay, or Amazon?

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:90%
See how you just up the ante?

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And the chances that they're
going to know someone who has

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.130 align:middle line:90%
exp--

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or raise
their hand, yes.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: And said, nah.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And even if someone says,
nah, I'm never online,

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
but my wife loves Amazon
and the free shipping,

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.450 align:middle line:84%
well, I make the software that
makes it safe for your wife

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.240 align:middle line:90%
to buy things on Amazon.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then he
goes home and says, hey.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Guess what though?

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.800 align:middle line:90%
He gets misty eyed.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you OK?

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.180 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I just can't wait to get
home from this conference.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:35.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can finally
explain to my 8-year-old son

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.223 align:middle line:84%
what it is I do in a way
he can understand it.

00:51:39.223 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Lisa, that's
what we're talking about.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we want to connect
with people in meaningful ways,

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.490 align:middle line:84%
not jargon, not scripted
elevator speeches

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.020 align:middle line:90%
that we give to people.

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They might as well not
even be in the room.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Our whole goal, whether
it's the happiness

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:84%
box, whether it's figuring out
what we want to do someday,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:84%
is to connect with our
life, is to connect

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.840 align:middle line:84%
what matters, what really
will matter in the long run,

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to connect with our loved
ones instead of taking them

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.310 align:middle line:90%
for granted.

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like, get clear about it.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And then do something about
it instead of waiting.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And in
today's day and age,

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.780 align:middle line:84%
where things move so fast and
you have a second on Facebook

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to talk to someone or
Instagram or some way to make

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a connection, you want to cut
out the noise of what people

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.420 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to look at anyway--

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.240 align:middle line:84%
the marketing
jargon and so forth.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I think you had an example
of a best-selling author that

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:90%
did that.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.395 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's right.

00:52:35.395 --> 00:52:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, Elmore Leonard
was asked why

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.200 align:middle line:90%
people loved his book so much.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I try to leave
out the parts people skip.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.530 align:middle line:10%
So speaking of authors,
I heard a great--

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.640 align:middle line:10%
on your great TED Talks.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.015 align:middle line:10%
And we haven't
gotten to the fact

00:52:51.015 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:10%
that you coach people on how
to deliver the home run TED

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.990 align:middle line:10%
Talk because you're so good
with framing people's stories

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.480 align:middle line:10%
and helping them
really from their heart

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.160 align:middle line:10%
connect people
with what they do.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.600 align:middle line:90%
That's your genius.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But there was a great story
you told me about a woman

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.475 align:middle line:84%
at the Maui Writers' conference
who hid in her hotel room.

00:53:11.475 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's right.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.240 align:middle line:10%
She had come out of
her pitch session

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.660 align:middle line:10%
with Bob Loomis, who was the
senior VP at Random House.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.150 align:middle line:90%
His clients are Maya Angelou.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And she came out with
tears in her eyes.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you OK?

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.660 align:middle line:90%
She said, I'm not OK.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just saw my
dream go down the drain.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And she had spent three
years on her manuscript.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what's it about?

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, her
mind went blank.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.450 align:middle line:84%
She had just been so
close to it for so long.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't explain it in a
way that would get his interest.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And she thought she had blown
it-- three years of work

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.080 align:middle line:90%
down the drain.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And I ran into her the next day.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.513 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did you go to
the reception last night?

00:53:49.513 --> 00:53:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
more agents there.

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.920 align:middle line:90%
There's other publishers there.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no, I hid
out in my hotel room.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:54:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And she had been so intimidated
by the thought of perhaps not

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.730 align:middle line:84%
being able to
explain what she did

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was intriguing,
she just didn't go.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I have learned is that
we don't have to know to go,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000 align:middle line:90%
is that we wait for perfection.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.080 align:middle line:84%
We wait until-- and so
many opportunities go by.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we just
set it in motion--

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a great story about
that if we have time.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: You and I have
talked about Mickey Agrawal.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And Mickey was an investment
banker in New York

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.470 align:middle line:10%
and started having stomach
problems because she ate out

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:35.270 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And most restaurant
food is bad for you.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So she GTSed it, Lisa,
Googled That Stuff.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Googled That Stuff, OK.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HORN: And she
found out that pizza

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is 10% of all food
sales in New York.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.470 align:middle line:90%
But pizza is bad for you.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But what if it
wasn't bad for you?

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's at the
core of "someday."

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:59.120 align:middle line:84%
What if I didn't have to do it
the way I had always done it?

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.300 align:middle line:84%
What if I did go somewhere
where I didn't know anyone,

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.620 align:middle line:90%
but I gave it a chance?

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.230 align:middle line:90%
What if I did decide to, right?

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So she googled it.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.500 align:middle line:10%
And she thought,
I'm going to start

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.060 align:middle line:10%
a farm-to-table
restaurant called

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.570 align:middle line:10%
Wild that serves healthy pizza.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, had she ever run
a restaurant before?

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Did she have a culinary degree?

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:20.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
However, part of this is
identifying something that's

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.310 align:middle line:90%
wrong that we want to fix.

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And we think, somebody should
do something about that,

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and realizing we're as much
as somebody as anybody.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:middle line:90%
We can do something like that.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And people can't
jump on our bandwagon

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.000 align:middle line:90%
if it's parked in the garage.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, great point.

00:55:40.415 --> 00:55:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she went on to become
entrepreneur of the year,

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:90%
didn't she?

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: She's "Time" magazine--

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.690 align:middle line:90%
one of the top 100 innovators.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.250 align:middle line:90%
She founded Thinx.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.660 align:middle line:90%
She founded Tushy.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:10%
She is on the board of
Conscious Capitalism.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, what if
she thought, well, I

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.940 align:middle line:84%
can't do this because
I've never done it before?

00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:58.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm going
to set it in motion.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to research it.

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask for help.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to iterate
along the way.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.690 align:middle line:10%
And when we set
things in motion,

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:11.720 align:middle line:10%
I believe the universe says,
well, you're doing your half.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.160 align:middle line:90%
All righty then.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's play.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.140 align:middle line:90%
We'll do our half.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll do my half, yes.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, she
didn't think, well,

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.460 align:middle line:90%
somebody else can do that.

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:84%
How many people had a great
idea, a great invention,

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.890 align:middle line:90%
where they had a need?

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman that I know
that has a butter dish.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And she was so tired of
putting the butter dish back

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.820 align:middle line:84%
on the top of it and getting
the butter everywhere

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and it melting all over.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.430 align:middle line:90%
She found a little flip door.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And she has-- in
stores everywhere

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and been in magazines
just because she

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:47.030 align:middle line:84%
created this brand-new
idea for a butter dish.

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:49.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HORN: I have a book
called "Ideapreneur."

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And I've interviewed
people around the world.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.600 align:middle line:10%
And so many people have
regrets because they

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:10%
can tell you exactly--

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.267 align:middle line:10%
I thought, why should I
be pulling my suitcase

00:56:57.267 --> 00:56:58.100 align:middle line:10%
through the airport?

00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I put
little wheels on it?

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Nah, somebody has
probably already done it.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was swimming,
I lived in an apartment

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.120 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, stroke, stroke,
turn, stroke, stroke, turn.

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, huh, what if
there was like a swim leash?

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And what if I could tie myself
off to the end of the pool

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:19.270 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't have to
swim in the ocean

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.410 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have to
stroke, stroke, turn?

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.613 align:middle line:84%
I went to an
invention convention.

00:57:24.613 --> 00:57:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I was going to.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And I never did it.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.660 align:middle line:84%
About a year later,
I'm flying United.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I open up-- ah,
there's a swim leash.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I will always regret
that I didn't go ahead and do

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that because it was a brilliant
idea that turns a backyard

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:42.770 align:middle line:84%
pool or an apartment pool into a
great workout where you're just

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.380 align:middle line:84%
swimming away, having
the time of your life

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.650 align:middle line:84%
without stroke, stroke,
turn, stroke, stroke, turn.

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You must have
the time of your life,

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:84%
speaking of which, helping
people learn and talk

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.170 align:middle line:90%
about what it is that they do.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I just have to ask you,
though, in your words, what

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:03.050 align:middle line:84%
is your biggest why as to
why you do what you do?

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: Hmm.

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, Lisa, I
was very fortunate.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:10%
In college, I had a
college professor.

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:13.880 align:middle line:10%
And instead of just
studying Socrates and Plato

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and Aristotle, he had us come
up with our mission statement,

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.230 align:middle line:10%
our philosophy of life.

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:22.620 align:middle line:90%
And I came up with something.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
my mission on Earth

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is to make a positive
difference for as many people

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.910 align:middle line:84%
as possible while maintaining
a happy, healthy life

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:33.620 align:middle line:90%
with friends and family.

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with that
sentence decades ago.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I haven't changed it.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is the core of why
I'm here and what I hope to do.

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I'm in
alignment with that--

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Dale Carnegie said, we should
live in day-tight compartments.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I think we should live in
day-right compartments.

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And if I am making a
difference for people

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.893 align:middle line:84%
and I'm outside walking
and enjoying life--

00:59:01.893 --> 00:59:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the water.

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: That's right.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Then my life is right.

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:10.460 align:middle line:10%
And once again, any one of us
can do this on a daily basis

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:10%
if we get clear about
those linchpins.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.580 align:middle line:10%
Yours is running.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Mine's walking, being
out in nature, staying

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.650 align:middle line:84%
connected with the people I
love, making a difference.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we're doing that,
the rest is a bonus.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what you do,
you can turn this around

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.740 align:middle line:84%
into something that engages
people and interests them

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and enrolls them
in whatever it is

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:35.420 align:middle line:90%
that you're passionate about.

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: I really believe that.

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, Michael
Altshuler said,

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.030 align:middle line:90%
the bad news is, time flies.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The good news is,
we're the pilot.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, right.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And your answered a time at
the beginning of the show.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for showing

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:54.290 align:middle line:84%
us so much on how we can make
someday every day of the week,

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.940 align:middle line:90%
really, if you think about it.

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.122 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sam.

00:59:57.122 --> 00:59:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HORN: You're welcome, Lisa.

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.185 align:middle line:10%
