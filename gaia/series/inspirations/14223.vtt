00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Experts are saying that
many people are experiencing

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:90%
higher stress levels than ever.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And with so many old
systems breaking down

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and new systems
on the forefront,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
one of those systems that's
in need of a new approach

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:90%
is our medical system.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Many people are taking
charge of their health

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and taking their health
into their own hands.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is an enormous
amount of technologies

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
here to support that
much needed trend.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is
neurosurgeon and founder

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
of the American Holistic
Medical Association, Doctor Norm

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Shealy.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
He is also the creator
of the original TENS unit

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that he created 45 years
ago for pain management.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And his work has
also greatly expanded

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:90%
the field of energy medicine.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Norm.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOCTOR NORM SHEALY: Well
it's great to be with you.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's great to have
you with us, and a true honor.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I am a huge fan of your work.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And just to have the opportunity
to sit with you today

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.776 align:middle line:84%
is enormous, especially
with all that you know.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And my goal here
is to really have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
you share what people don't know
about how many technologies are

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
accessible when it
has to do with pain.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
People don't need to stay in
pain and depression for as long

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:90%
as they have been.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: No, I've actually
worked with 40,000 people.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And over
30,000 of them

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
had depression as
well as chronic pain.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I can get 85% of them out of
depression within two weeks

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.287 align:middle line:90%
without drugs, safely.

00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Permanently?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yes.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Safely?

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Safely.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Without drugs.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Without drugs.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.827 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is why you're here.

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:44.022 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Safely.

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because people
need to know this.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They need to know that you
don't need to necessarily run

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to the pain pills or stay
in that state of depression.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of circumstances,
things happen.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's about resilience.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts
of tools and technology

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.252 align:middle line:84%
out there that can get you
into that place of resilience

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy way.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yes.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about energy medicine.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
First of all we're throwing
that term around a little bit.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.416 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well it's
actually everything.

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:90%
You and I are energy.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And drugs and surgery, which
are conventional medicine,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
are parts of energy.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But in general, the
term energy medicine

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is using those tools that
are not drugs or surgery.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wide variety of
physical, mental, emotional,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.172 align:middle line:90%
chemical approaches to health.

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you, of
course, are a neurosurgeon.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:90%
You came from the medical field.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.586 align:middle line:90%
How do you compare the two?

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:35.835 align:middle line:90%
Is it an integrative approach?

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it an oppositional approach?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:90%
What is your opinion?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: There's
a place for both.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
About 15% of the time
people need drugs or surgery

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:90%
to save their life.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But 85% of the time, especially
when the problem becomes

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
chronic, drugs are
likely to make it worse,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and surgery is not the answer.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's that 85% of the
time that, unfortunately,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
conventional
medicine still treats

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
as if it's an acute illness.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And all these things that you
see on television about this,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that, and the other drug,
those called side effects,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.495 align:middle line:90%
they're complications.

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you die,
it's a complication.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And 106,000 people
die every year

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.239 align:middle line:84%
just from drugs,
prescribed drugs.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I mean, it makes sense.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I've had many
friends who have been

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:90%
on various different protocols.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And to get all the doctors to
be on a team and talk together

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
takes a lot these
days, where it comes

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.562 align:middle line:90%
to insurance and so forth.

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective,
though, you're a neurosurgeon.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You came from
operating and going

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:90%
through intricate surgeries.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you make a choice,
a conscious choice,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:90%
to no longer do that?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
back in the '60s it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
was obvious to me that cutting
the spinal cord, or the brain,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
or a peripheral nerve for
chronic, non-cancer pain

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
was crazy.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I started in the early
'60s looking for alternatives.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:90%
How do we control pain?

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.617 align:middle line:84%
And my first invention was
something called dorsal column

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:84%
stimulation, where
we actually planted

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
a pacemaker over
the spinal cord.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.222 align:middle line:84%
And then I developed
transcutaneous

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
electrical nerve
stimulation, which

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
has many more applications.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.419 align:middle line:84%
But I got into using
acupuncture in the mid '60s.

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little
bit about the TENS unit.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
People might or might
not know about it.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very famous--
it's used worldwide for pain

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And it stands for--

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
different devices now.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:90%
We can put out any frequency.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
most recent development

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is what I call human
DNA frequency, 54 to 78

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
billion cycles per second,
at a billionth of a watt.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is useful for
stimulating acupuncture points.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
take the TENS unit,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
which was just simple impulses
to the-- nerve impulses, right?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.627 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Impulses to
the nerves, right?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yep.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.584 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And at a
very low frequency.

00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you take the
human DNA frequency--

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:11.675 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Explain those three
words, human DNA frequency.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Our DNA,
which is in every cell,

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
actually is vibrating,
if you will, at 54 to 78

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
billion cycles per second.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But we're using a
billionth of a watt

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:90%
to recharge the DNA circuit.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
You can re--

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now, you
don't lose frequency,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:90%
as long as you're alive.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But you lose amplitude,
if you will, strength.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And by putting these frequencies
back into specific acupuncture

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
points, we literally
recharge the DNA battery.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So stress
takes it out of us.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.539 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Stress
takes it out of us.

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can literally
recharge the DNA battery.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It works.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem I've
found is that people

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
don't want to spend
the time that it takes.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So I've started talking, six
years ago, about using it

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
for specific things, to
rejuvenate the body as a whole,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:90%
to extend healthy longevity.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've found that 90
plus percent of people

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't spend 20 minutes
a day to save their life.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That sounds
so ridiculous.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:90%
It sounds so ridiculous.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But many, many people,
including myself,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.329 align:middle line:84%
are probably guilty
of that very thing.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we
wouldn't spend-- I mean,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.951 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the awareness
of these technologies

00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is first and foremost.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But then people
wouldn't use them?

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Just because of time.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Just because of time.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, I can--
with 20 minutes I

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
can stimulate one circuit in the
body and do phenomenal things.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I've actually
moved, in the last year,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
towards using things that
take 30 seconds instead

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of 20 minutes.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, actually,
Doctor Shealy produced a DVD.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.171 align:middle line:90%
And you did this DVD yourself.

00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's the Medical
Renaissance Series, The Secret

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Code.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right, and I wanted to
show what the possibilities are

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
in a wide variety of ways of
treating pain and depression.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there are several
technologies out there.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And this-- we actually
have a clip from the DVD,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to show
just a few of these.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I really want
people to understand.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've gone from
everything from the TENS unit

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to now changing
human DNA frequency.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.697 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I think it's
really important that people

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
are aware of some of the things.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.988 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go to
a clip, and show people

00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
a clip of-- this is from the
Medical Renaissance DVD called

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The Secret Code, produced
by Doctor Norm Shealy.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now I'd like to show
some of the other things that

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
led us upon this path
for what is now called

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
complementary alternative
medicine, integrative medicine.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I still think of it
as holistic medicine,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:90%
medicine of the whole person.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I was able, with the help
of engineers and physicists,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to produce a modern solid
state electrode, essentially,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
which is called a Shealy TENS.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
This particular device
is infinitely more

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
effective at treating pain than
acupuncture in the long run.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I love acupuncture,
I've done it since 1967.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:90%
But this is more effective.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And we apply it through
electrodes directly onto areas

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
above, or below,
or around the pain,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and to specific
acupuncture points

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to help create specific
neuro-chemical changes that

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
allow pain control, and
sometimes mood control.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1975, an engineer
named Saul Liss brought me

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
this device, which is called
the Liss Cranial Electrical

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Stimulator.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that when
we apply this transcranially

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
it markedly rejuvenates
the body's ability

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to make serotonin, and
raises beta endorphins,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the natural narcotics
that make you feel good.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
When I learned that you had had
a life of not sleeping well,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:90%
what did I do?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.197 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: You offered me a few
supplements and a cranial--

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And a Liss Stimulator.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yep.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And the first
night, after you'd

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
used it in the
morning, what happened?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Went to bed
and slept great.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And here we are
now, several months later,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:90%
and how's your sleep now?

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.481 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Last night I went to bed
and didn't even think about it,

00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and went to sleep.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.102 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know I
woke up and come to work.

00:09:50.102 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And how many hours?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Eight plus.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's neat!

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
What's your feeling
like during the day

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%
now, compared to before?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I'm not worn down.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.267 align:middle line:90%
I feel like Energizer Bunny now.

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's terrific.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
In the later '70s,
mid '70s roughly,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that flashing
light also helps relaxation.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
All patients with
depression are agitated

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%
to a greater or lesser extent.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So inability to relax
is a part of it.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we created this
particular device,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
Shealy RelaxMate.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
When we combine this
with a Liss Stimulator,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
we can get 85% of
people out of depression

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
safely, without drugs,
within two weeks.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So these three things--
the Shealy TENS,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
the Liss Cranial Electrical
Stimulator, and the RelaxMate--

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
are the single most important
parts of our entire treatment

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other
things that we use.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we have used intermittently,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
but increasingly, is
a modern derivation

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of this particular device,
called the Violet Ray.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I had an intuitive
impression, some 15 years ago,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
that if we applied this
to a copper pyramid

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:90%
it would enhance the effect.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we now
call the RejuvaMatrix.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
system that we use

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
for getting the
whole body bathed

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
in this atmosphere of
human DNA frequency

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they can have a
possibility of reversing

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.015 align:middle line:90%
DNA damage.

00:11:37.015 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And in our recent pilot
study, the telomeres actually

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:90%
grew 1% within three months.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Ordinarily they
shrink 1% a year.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That means within five
years, your telomeres

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:90%
could be back at age 25.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.656 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so those are
just some of the technologies

00:11:55.656 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
that you-- I mean
those were just four.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.042 align:middle line:90%
Well we probably have 50.

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 50?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
50 technologies for getting
rid of pain and depression.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.662 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's enormous.

00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well it's also
important because, you know,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
different strokes
for different folks.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
try different things.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.634 align:middle line:84%
You know, if a patient
believes in it, it works.

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But why
aren't these units

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and these different
techniques and technologies

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
in places like physical
therapy offices?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Because
the pharmaco mafia

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
now owns the world,
unfortunately.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell it like it is.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well I've not ever
been known to be a sheep.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nope.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And unfortunately,
in the last 30 years,

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical
industry has really

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
taken over American medicine.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So
brainwashed, in a way?

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Absolutely.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That we need
to take a pill in order

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of pain
and depression.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.871 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's four
major studies, including

00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
one in the New England
Journal of Medicne,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
our most prestigious
journal, that

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
says if the pharmaceutical
companies had allowed all

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the negative research
studies to be published,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the net result for
antidepressant drugs

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
would be zero.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the placebo
effect is also in--

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --those commercials
that we're seeing.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: In everything.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So I can get 85% of people out
of depression, which is twice

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.192 align:middle line:84%
as good as the best
reported drug, which is 42%.

00:13:24.192 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
commercials that are

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
out there are saying that this
is going to make you feel good.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
effectiveness of the drug?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: You bet.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we were to--
this is one of the reasons

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
we're talking to you-- is that
these things have scientific

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
data behind them, clinical
research, double blind,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:90%
have you--

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Published data?

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've got 300
published articles as well as

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.896 align:middle line:90%
my 28 books.

00:13:47.896 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the average
physician is not

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be exposed to this
because they're under pressure

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:84%
from the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And sales are important, and
reputation relationships,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of course, of course.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%

this much of a mad scientist

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.635 align:middle line:90%

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, that's where
intuition comes in, of course.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that, you know,
I've got 14 patents now.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I could have had a few more.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Some things I don't patent just

you know, what do you

00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:90%
see is the future of medicine?

>>SHEALY: Well
I'm hoping that we

are, as we go through this
current financial and other

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
crisis, going to
get to the point

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.944 align:middle line:84%
where people need to become
responsible for themselves.

00:14:52.944 --> 00:14:55.485 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in my opinion,
your number one responsibility

00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
is to take care of this body.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the temple in which
your soul has incarnated.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
take care of it,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
you can't expect somebody
else to do it for you.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, it's the
philosophy of pull the oxygen

00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
mask down on yourself first and
then you can help other people.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: If you are able to
take care of yourself first.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.376 align:middle line:84%
So you think that
people are going

00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to start to, as I said
earlier, take their health back

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:90%
into their own hands.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, health begins
at home, with an attitude.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:90%
First of all, it's an attitude.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.929 align:middle line:84%
I am OK and I'm
worth taking care of.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:90%
That's so critical.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
mindset and how much of it

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
your belief system,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and is that where to start?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, it's
absolutely where it starts.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, the one thing I
learned very early in my work

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
with chronic pain
patients who have

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
become invalids is
poor self esteem.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:90%
It is rampant in our society.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
good self esteem,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
then you try to find
something outside yourself

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:90%
to justify your existence.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is that what you
think is at the base of people

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
having a lack of belief
in themselves in order

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to heal themselves?

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And it starts
because they didn't

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.472 align:middle line:84%
get feeling of being
adequately nurtured as a child.

00:16:17.472 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Look all
around you and you

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, I
mean for 5,000 years

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
every religion in the
world has put women down,

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:90%
which has got to be ridiculous!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
here without women.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.107 align:middle line:84%
We're not cloned
out of something.

00:16:33.107 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And secondly,
for 2,000 years

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.351 align:middle line:84%
the Western churches have
said you're a sinner.

00:16:40.351 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot of guilt, yeah.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah, and so it's
amazing to me that about 20%

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of people escape, and
about 80% of people

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
are either depressed
or have what

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.232 align:middle line:84%
I call a sub-clinical
depressive miasma.

00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:56.524 align:middle line:84%
They're about that
far from depression.

00:16:56.524 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've worked with
people who are clinically

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:90%

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, heavens yes.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.528 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --40 something years.

00:17:01.528 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you know everything
about a person who comes in

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
that either is it
circumstantial,

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
it's genetic, it's as
you said, psychosomatic.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And ultimately,
is very chemical.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:84%
There's more abnormal
chemistry in people

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:90%
with depression than anything.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your serotonin,
your norepinephrine,

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
your beta endorphin, your
melatonin, your cholinesterase,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
are abnormal.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't normalize
those, it's not going to work.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can't normalize
those with drugs.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.746 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that the
antidepressant drugs talk

00:17:37.746 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
about it may be an effect upon
serotonin or norepinephrine.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want the effect,
not a maybe effect.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.465 align:middle line:84%

anti-depressant drugs, where

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.647 align:middle line:90%
I do them with these devices.

00:17:52.647 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's so many more

00:17:59.274 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:90%

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.005 align:middle line:90%

>>SHEALY: Right, exactly.

00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is
a lot of amperage.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But it's 15,000

of course.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system
works on frequency.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And so just by wear--

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
have to lie down or
meditate or anything.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You could walk around, eat

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've done all kinds
of research on it.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And it does raise serotonin.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was one of
the first subjects,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of course-- I'm always
the ritual Guinea pig.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
My serotonin, which is
quite normal to start with,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
went up to five times the
upper limit of normal.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you measured this
via blood tests and so forth?

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And for
most people, it only

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
doubles their serotonin,

serotonin, of course,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:90%

>>SHEALY: If we do this

>>LISA: '54, OK.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it's just so
perfect because every thought

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
is a prayer--

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Set in motion.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Prayer sets in
motion spiritual forces

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring about change in
body, mind, emotions, desires,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:90%
hopes, and despairs.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
We should focus not on the
elimination of a condition,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
but on the creation of
the condition desired.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what's critical, not to
try to get rid of something,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but to create the
perfect something.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely, this
is very, very important.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to show
the clip, because Norm

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
goes through that
again, in this clip,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and really, really
pay attention.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Write this down if you can.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's see that clip.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The single
most important thing,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
from my point of
view, is in general

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:84%
except in acute
illnesses where you

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
must have proper
medical care, that's

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:90%
where modern medicine is superb.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You need drugs,
you need surgery.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But in most chronic
illnesses, or illnesses

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
where the doctor says
it's all in your head,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or there's nothing
we can do, then

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole plethora
of things that can help.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
understand and see

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
the variety of safe alternatives
to drugs and surgery.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, these
individuals are failures

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:90%
of conventional medicine.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:90%
They're 50% to 80% better.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Yeah.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And we've still got
time for them to continue.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Well you
know, we've talked

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot about what you do here.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But you kept telling me
about the secret code.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
What is it, Norm?

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
What is the secret code?

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well you've
heard me talk about--

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Sure, Ambrose--

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.344 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Ambrose Worrall.

00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Yeah.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, the secret code
was written by him in 1952.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's right here.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.072 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Oh.

00:22:32.072 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's been
here all along.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Right in
front of my nose.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: "Every
thought is a prayer.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Thinking sets in
motion spiritual forces

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to bring about change
in everything," he says.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the important
thing, from my point of view,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is there's no such
thing as non-thinking.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Words are substitutes
for images.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And as Ambrose went on to
say in his Essay On Prayer,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.760 align:middle line:84%
"It's created not in
words, but in images."

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to say it in words;

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:90%
you can do it either way.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate is you
do not try to get rid

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:90%
of an undesired condition.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
You create the desired
condition with words and images.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: I think I get it.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: You've
had it all along.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You just didn't remember it.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Thank you, Norm.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Everyone thanks you.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:90%
We've done well.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: There is a medical
renaissance going on.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And this-- these are the
elements of that renaissance.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:90%
These are the new medicines.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the new treatments
of that renaissance.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the new language
of that renaissance,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and these are the
new practitioners.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Here is a place in
which we will open ourselves up

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to dare to imagine
that we can create

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.392 align:middle line:90%
new endings to the old story.

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
That we don't simply
have to recapitulate

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
the past, but that we have
an opportunity to change.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.079 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've gone
through a combination

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.145 align:middle line:90%
of some of the technologies.

00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And now we've gone
through this last clip,

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
which was so
beautifully stating what

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and how important
the belief system is,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that you
are telling yourself,

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and that your
thoughts become things

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:90%
when you put them into motion.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.364 align:middle line:84%
So with a combination of--
both of the knowledge of both

00:24:49.364 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of those things--
and you know all

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
about the technologies and all
about the belief systems-- what

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is the practical thing
that we can do at home now?

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well there's
several aspects

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:90%
that are particularly important.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:84%
One of those is the
basic retraining

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system, which
would be autogenic training.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other is stimulating,
through vision and tapping,

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.315 align:middle line:84%
specific acupuncture
circuits would

00:25:13.315 --> 00:25:16.187 align:middle line:84%
have very specific
biochemical effects.

00:25:16.187 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's some of the
science behind tapping?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about tapping.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.269 align:middle line:90%
It's also called something else.

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Emotional
freedom technique

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.095 align:middle line:90%
is the most commonly known one.

00:25:27.095 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I need
one for the brain.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, you know, I've
been doing this for 40 years,

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
because we are
piezoelectric beings.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Our body is like a
giant quartz crystal.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So if I do that, I actually
produce an electric current.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And it may not be
quite as effective

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
as putting in the 54 to 78
billion cycle, but it works.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And it works very well.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, especially
with the ring of air,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.385 align:middle line:84%
I've had people go into a
deep, deep state of trance

00:26:02.385 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:90%
just from tapping the points.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tapping is
basically sending a signal

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.044 align:middle line:84%
through the electrical
signals of the body.

00:26:11.044 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it stimulates the
production of various chemicals

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:90%
in the body--

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.452 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly

00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --naturally.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Naturally.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Naturally.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.277 align:middle line:84%
And these are hormones,
neurotransmitters,

00:26:22.277 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of things.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And of course,
interestingly, way

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
back 20 years ago,
I demonstrated

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that when we stimulate
electrically certain points,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:84%
it follows these
acupuncture meridians.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I stimulate this, this
produces and electrical current

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.504 align:middle line:84%
that comes up here,
specifically right into there.

00:26:47.504 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it joins
with another one

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that goes down the
front of the body.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is the
main nerve of the face.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
This is-- well large
intestine meridian.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
According to Ukrainian
nuclear physicists,

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the internal organs
project to the surface

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of the body a
projection electrically.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a two way circuit.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
From the heart, for
instance, goes from here

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
down to the tip of the
little finger and back again.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I have developed
five different circuits,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:28.604 align:middle line:84%
which have very specific effects
upon chemistry and health.

00:27:28.604 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's go
through some of these.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:90%
So they're called rings.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Rings,
because it is a circuit.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and so there's
certain rings of the body

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
experiencing and tapping

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:90%
on and learning about.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.227 align:middle line:90%
So what is the first one?

00:27:43.227 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: The ring of air.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now the ring of
air is for developing, quote,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:90%
simultaneity of thought.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, for
developing intuition.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
For getting into that state of
detachment from worry worting,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to really being in touch
with the inner self,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
the mystical self, if you
will, the spiritual self.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.201 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The detachment from
the obsessive, frenetic--

00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The broken
records that we play.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, thinking
from that activity

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
to something that is more
cohesive and detached

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:84%
in away from the
Buddhist philosophy.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
my basic philosophy,

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
detached from the things
you cannot change,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.940 align:middle line:84%
not be judgmental, have
no need to know why,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and to be at peace.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:90%
That's utter detachment.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:90%
That's beautifully stated.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.594 align:middle line:90%
That's a zero stress zone.

00:28:42.594 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that's
where we should be.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.343 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when you
stimulate the ring of air,

00:28:46.343 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that's what it does for
you, because it activates

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
two of the most important
chemicals that put you

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:84%
into that state, neurotensin,
which is a, quote, neuroleptic.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
A neuroleptic is a
chemical we produce

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.565 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that actually
helps us-- that's delightful.

00:29:02.565 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
worry about that.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love the-- does this.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.424 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies produce
these chemicals on its own.

00:29:08.424 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
doesn't overproduce.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It knows the exact amount
that we need to produce.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
stimulating-- and I've

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
been doing this in one way
or another for many years--

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.589 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anybody overproduce.

00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, interesting, right.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Because the body--

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.598 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Under produce, yes.

00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But we can activate the body
to regenerate its ability

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
to make its own.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So the ring of air activates
neurotensin and oxytocin,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:84%
which is the bonding,
nurturing hormone.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.661 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:29:37.661 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So by tapping on these various
meridians in the body--

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:90%
so let's try this at home.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
try this at home.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there are various points
in the body we're going to--

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's right.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:84%
With the ring of
air, of course, we're

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.821 align:middle line:84%
going to begin at the
tip of the big toe.

00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Then we go
on the top of the foot,

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
between the first
toe and the big toe.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Then would go up the side
of the calf, right up

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.952 align:middle line:84%
the outside of the bone,
both sides, of course.

00:30:05.952 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we just
tapping on these to--

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.326 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Just tap,
that's all it takes.

00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And this-- what
meridian is this?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: This is stomach 36.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Energetically this is the second
strongest acupuncture point

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.435 align:middle line:90%
in the human body, stomach 36.

00:30:21.435 --> 00:30:21.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Why is that the
second strongest?

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It just energetically
carries more oomph,

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:84%
The strongest is
Hoku, it doesn't

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:84%
happen to be in
any of the rings.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
This is Hoku, or
large intestine four.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So we take the
energy from the toes,

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
feet, up the sides of
the calf, comes across

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.976 align:middle line:90%
to the base of the spine.

00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, we're standing.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Then--

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.096 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Back here?

00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The very
bottom of the spine.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, all right.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.722 align:middle line:90%
Base of the spine, tapping--

00:30:50.722 --> 00:30:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --vessel one.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:52.285 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Comes all the way up
to the top governing vessel 16.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The back, so we're
on the back here, OK.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now, it crosses
inside and comes out

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:90%
below the collar bones.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.844 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right out by the
shoulders on both sides.

00:31:07.844 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Then it goes under
that, up the side of the neck

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and halfway across
the back of the skull.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Gallbladder 20.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These areas
right here, OK.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then all of them
meet at governing vessel 20.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've pulled
the energy all the way up.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It also goes
back down, of course.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So in a well circulated, if you
will, balanced body the energy

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:90%
comes up and it goes down.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what the
flow-- and doing this process,

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and tapping on those things
that you saw on the diagram,

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:90%
is the way to produce--

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.882 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --neurotensin--

00:31:49.882 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And oxytocin.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And oxytocin.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And, of course,
you can associate that also

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
with some wonderful
guided imagery.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, right, as well.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: For instance,
imagine that you're

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
breathing in through the
tips of your big toes.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right into
the center of your foot,

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and back out again, into
the top of your feet,

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:90%
right into the center.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as you're doing
the tapping you can--

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Imagine you're
breathing into your calves.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're breathing
into the base of your spine,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:90%
up to the top.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
This is Kundalini rising,
the Kundalini energy

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.672 align:middle line:90%
comes right up the spine.

00:32:31.672 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And, for people that
aren't familiar with it,

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:90%
what is the Kundalini energy?

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, this is your
stored sexual and, essentially,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.809 align:middle line:84%
connection with body,
mind, and spirit energy.

00:32:44.809 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is the fire.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: The fire.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Although
it's the ring of air.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
also a ring of fire.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Of course.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, but this part of it is
that-- this particular circuit

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:90%
is for Kundalini energy.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And often, if you have
a spontaneous Kundalini

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
experience, which I
did about 15 years ago,

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.652 align:middle line:84%
it really changes
your consciousness.

00:33:03.652 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do all of that
from just stimulating meridians

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.542 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again,
without medication.

00:33:11.542 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
All right, so
there's another ring.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.083 align:middle line:84%
There's five total that
we're going to go through.

00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
the ring of crystal.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.206 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well the
ring of crystal

00:33:18.206 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is wonderful for
rejuvenation because it truly

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:90%
reduces free radicals.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Free radicals are those
by-products of metabolism

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.880 align:middle line:90%
that actually kill cells.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are
producing free radicals.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:84%
That's an oxygen molecule
that's looking for a home.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So all illnesses, wrinkling,
and ultimately death

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
are the result of
excess free radicals.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is the--
basically the anti-aging ring.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.824 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: If you could keep your
free radicals down, minimal,

00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:84%
most people are running what
I call a three plus to a four

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:90%
plus--

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:33:58.323 --> 00:34:00.339 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --you could
keep them down to half--

00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, because there's a
lot of toxins out in the world.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.945 align:middle line:84%
So that does create
free radicals.

00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:05.194 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly, and stress.

00:34:05.194 --> 00:34:07.553 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, we
could create our own.

00:34:07.553 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so if you could
just keep them

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:84%
down low like that, every seven
years every cell in your body

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:90%
is reproduced.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It wears out.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, some cells
faster than that.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But all of them
within seven years.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you kept your free
radicals down that low,

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.826 align:middle line:84%
they would be born
again like baby cells.

00:34:24.826 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can really stimulate
the regrowth of these cells

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:84%
and reduce the amount of free
radicals running in the body

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:90%
by tapping--

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: The ring of crystal.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.736 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The ring of crystal.

00:34:35.736 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it reduces
free radicals by 85%.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else has ever been found
to reduce free radicals that

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not even vitamin C.

00:34:45.055 --> 00:34:46.887 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right, not
even vitamin-- not even

00:34:46.887 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:90%
intravenous vitamin C.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.402 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:34:48.402 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And I've
looked at all of that.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
So tapping the ring of
crystal is really important.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.459 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And would you--

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's do it, yes.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a demonstration.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.321 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: We start at the feet.

00:34:58.321 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
This the spleen

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.559 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Then we come up--

00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, I'm
doing this along with you.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --and halfway
at the bottom of buttocks,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:84%
halfway front to
back of the thighs.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.956 align:middle line:90%
So right in the center.

00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where your
hip bones are.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right, you're
right on the bone itself.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Then it comes up to
just above the belly button,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and exactly the same point
over the spine in the back.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these points
match in the body.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.998 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: These points match.

00:35:27.998 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then you go up to
the bottom of the breast bone,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and I switch arms then so your
shoulder doesn't get hurt,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and you do this one.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.974 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Then you come up to
the top of your Eve's Apple.

00:35:40.974 --> 00:35:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My Eve's, your Adam.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then I
don't tap there, I twist.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want to
bruise your vocal cords.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And tap in the back.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now why are you doing
the points across the body,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:53.890 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.650 align:middle line:90%
What's the significance of that?

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.608 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Because that's
what I was told to do.

00:35:57.608 --> 00:35:59.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:59.225 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: You know,
you just get that--

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the scientific
explanation right there.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.313 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --that says do
this, that's what you do,

00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and it works.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you go here,
at the front where

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.819 align:middle line:90%
the ear comes into the scalp.

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and you can also
massage these points, just

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:14.776 align:middle line:90%
circular motion.

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yeah.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:90%
You can do that, or that.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.314 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then again--

00:36:19.314 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The top.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.852 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --governing vessel 20.

00:36:21.852 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Governing vessel, OK.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.845 align:middle line:84%
And this is stimulating,
as you mentioned--

00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It reduces
free radicals.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Malondialdehyde
is a chemical that

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:84%
is a waste product
of fat metabolism

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
so that when the free
radicals damages a cell,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the cell wall, the fatty
outline of the cell

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:84%
disappears and comes out in
the urine as malondialdehyde.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
you're measuring

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.890 align:middle line:84%
when you measure
free radical damage.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see, OK, right.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Right, and you have a
test for that that shows--

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Very simple test.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.949 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:36:54.949 --> 00:36:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So far we've simulated
our oxytocin.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten rid of
a few free radicals.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.912 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to move
into the ring of fire.

00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Ah, now
that was actually

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.907 align:middle line:84%
the first one I started with,
because I started looking

00:37:06.907 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:90%
at DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And my first intuitive hit
was that maybe the reason

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:84%
we lose DHEA is that
progesterone stops

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
being made in women
after menopause.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so it declines.

00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so I
started off doing it

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:84%
in seven men who had
low DHEA, giving them

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.340 align:middle line:90%
natural progesterone cream.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
it raised their DHEA.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I published this,
a professor of endocrinology

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:84%
from France wrote, there's
no pathway to do this.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Well by that time I
had dozens of people.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing my
patients don't know this,

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:90%
because they can do it.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.616 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They were saying that
it was working, interesting.

00:37:47.616 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right, but if
you start off at 100,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:56.809 align:middle line:84%
and your ideal is 450 or above,
and you double it, it's good

00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:90%
but it's not good enough.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down one day and
I said what else can I do?

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And here is what
I essentially got.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.170 align:middle line:84%
If I would stimulate the points
that connect the kidneys, which

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:84%
are your ancestral
chi, with the gonads,

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
with the adrenal glands, with
the thyroid, and the pituitary,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.324 align:middle line:84%
through a window of the sky
point, it will raise DHEA.

00:38:18.324 --> 00:38:21.106 align:middle line:90%
And that is the ring of fire.

00:38:21.106 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now DHEA also has many
benefits for women, as well.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It has
phenomenal benefits.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the youth hormone.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm, again.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's, again, a
major anti-aging component.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And all people lose DHEA
after age 25, depending

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.660 align:middle line:84%
upon the amount of stress they
have and upon their genetics.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's
a stress reducer?

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yes, it
is a stress reducer.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Well actually what happens
is, is true burnout

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.926 align:middle line:84%
is losing the
ability to make DHEA.

00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's adrenal
function, I should say.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It supports adrenal function
more than reducing stress.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah, it reduces
the effects of stress.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then-- so we looked
at what will it do human?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are diseases I
would call diseases of fire.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Migraine, reduces migraines 75%.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.941 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Diabetic
neuropathy, where

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
people are losing feeling in
their feet, and having pain,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.124 align:middle line:90%
80%.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.696 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, I
do the left side

00:40:36.696 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing the pubic bone,
which is conception vessel one,

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.340 align:middle line:90%
with bladder 22.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But there's a bladder
22 on the other side.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And we do that with the one
just below the belly button.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So that's
another pair,

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
energy to go through.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now this is if you're
in the throes of a migraine,

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:90%
you do this.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.130 align:middle line:84%
You start with down here,
we're going to stand up.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we go here on the left
side, and then the right side.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, next.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then you go
up to mast of the heart.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a very
important one right here,

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
because this is the control
center for the sympathetic,

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
the alarm, the
adrenaline system.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:90%
So you want to turn that down.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're in
that panic place as well,

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:90%
this is a really good place to--

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Ahh!

>>SHEALY: Go hard.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, to calm
yourself down, OK.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And, of course,
then you go up to the window

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.547 align:middle line:90%
of the sky point--

00:41:30.547 --> 00:41:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Window of the sky?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.296 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --which is
large intestine 18.

00:41:33.296 --> 00:41:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just below
the mastoid bone.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right where
the TMJ point is.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.427 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:41:39.427 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's very important.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Because this now brings
the energy right up

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.875 align:middle line:84%
and you come to the
top of the head.

00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And now you bring that
through the pituitary, down

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to conception vessel 18,
which is the thyroid point.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:54.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:58.095 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually stimulate
the thyroid gland?

00:41:58.095 --> 00:41:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: You see,
actually we're

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
stimulating gonads, adrenal

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:84%

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I can actually really feel that.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:90%
The top of my head is pulsing.

That's really great.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.290 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
the ring of fire.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.829 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it is phenomenally
powerful, clinically.

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:42.620 align:middle line:90%

And also, it allows you to

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Of course.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, interesting.

>>SHEALY: Well all
of them, I think,

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:84%

to the sky points, different
window to the sky points.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Windows of the sky, in
classic Chinese cosmology,

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:84%
are allowing the opening up of

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK, I understand.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Now what if you're on
any type of medication

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that either supplements
your thyroid

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:84%
or supplements various chemicals
in the body, does it matter?

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: No problem.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I have
many people who

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:84%
want to get off
thyroid medication.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.554 align:middle line:84%
And I say well, here's what
I would do in that situation.

00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:24.970 align:middle line:84%
First of all I'd
take some iodine,

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.210 align:middle line:84%
because we're usually
deficient in iodine.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And then start tapping
the ring of fire.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple
weeks to a month,

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.610 align:middle line:84%
cut your thyroid
medication in half.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Continue that for
the second month.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And then cut out your
thyroid medication.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Wait another month, continue the
tapping, continue the iodine,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and then check your
thyroid function.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.502 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So don't check it
intermittently via blood tests.

00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Check at the
beginning and the end?

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right, actually if you
just check your temperature--

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --that'll work fine.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:84%
If your temperature
is below 98.6

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:84%
when you've been out of
bed three hours or more,

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.252 align:middle line:90%
you're hypothyroid.

00:44:03.252 --> 00:44:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, so you need
to supplement your thyroid

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.210 align:middle line:84%
in either through the
ring stimulations,

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and breathing into the
rings, and guided meditation,

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and imagery, and so forth.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:84%
thyroid replacement is
really, of all the glandulars,

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.055 align:middle line:84%
safer and more effective
long term than any of them.

00:44:39.055 --> 00:44:40.680 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Mm, wow, my goodness.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the next one
is the ring of earth, right?

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now the ring of
earth is a very important ring

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:90%
because it raises calcitonin.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And calcitonin is
another hormone

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:90%
made in the thyroid gland.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting, OK.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But it is responsible

putting calcium into your bone.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Now as you probably know,
the most common cause

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.806 align:middle line:90%
because of osteoporosis.

00:45:19.806 --> 00:45:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Calcitonin helps
keep the bone strong.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But calcitonin is also 40 to 60
times as powerful as morphine

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.832 align:middle line:90%
for reducing pain.

00:45:32.832 --> 00:45:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So as a

the ring of Earth

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:90%
is critically important.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So also, the calcitonin
that the body is producing

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.330 align:middle line:84%
itself is the right
kind of calcium.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.923 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes the
calcium that we take--

00:45:49.923 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's calcitonin,
it's not calcium.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It's a hormone.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:53.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks.

00:45:53.904 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It keeps calcium
going into the bone.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.357 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
have calcitonin,

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:84%
you can have all the
calcium you want and it

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.050 align:middle line:90%
won't get into the bone.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Get into the
bone, interesting.

00:46:03.775 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY:
Interestingly, the drug

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that is available
for calcitonin is

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.160 align:middle line:84%
one of those made out
of salmon calcitonin.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can have an
allergic reaction to that.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: You can die
from anaphylaxis, shock.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.159 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to die
from making your own calcitonin.

00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From-- all right.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's figure out to the

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.369 align:middle line:84%
points that you tap in order
to stimulate the calcitonin.

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: OK.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can also
see this on the diagram.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now this, there's
only one acupuncture point

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
on the sole of the
foot, right there.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.851 align:middle line:90%
That's kidney one.

00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that on
the diagram as well, OK.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now, then you
go outside the ankle bone,

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.892 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:46:50.892 --> 00:46:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is also stimulating--

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --is bladder 60, a
very strong bladder meridian

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.100 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.635 align:middle line:84%
Then you go right behind the
very center, behind the knee.

00:47:00.635 --> 00:47:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The knee, OK.

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right
up in the center.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.386 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, we've
got that, all right.

00:47:06.386 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.014 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the diagram
at the same time, OK great.

00:47:11.014 --> 00:47:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you come up here
behind the collar bone.

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.252 align:middle line:90%
And this is large intestine 16.

00:47:19.252 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is where
all the stress gets held.

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Exactly,
it's right in that

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.790 align:middle line:90%
hollow behind the collar bone.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you come over
here-- now, here's

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:31.170 align:middle line:84%
another where we pinch
instead of tap, because you're

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:90%
right over the carotid artery.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So right beside the top
of your Eve's apple.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And you just turn--
take it and twist.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
really pinch, that's

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.920 align:middle line:90%
still physical stimulation.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And you take-- go
behind the muscle that turns

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:90%
your neck--

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is
a very big muscle.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Uh huh, and
there you can tap.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.466 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that of
course is another window

00:47:55.466 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:90%
to the sky point.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And then you wind up--

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're all winding
up on the top of the head.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.462 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: They're all
interconnected right there.

00:48:03.462 --> 00:48:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this-- does
this activate them all?

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.316 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a way of
bringing the energy up?

00:48:08.316 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's a way of bringing
the energy up so it then

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:11.790 align:middle line:90%
can move back down.

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK, great.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, how many times
a day do you do these?

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well in general,
depending upon your need.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Once a day for most people,
twice a day at the most.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.667 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: How long does it take?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Well as you know,
I've been playing

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.230 align:middle line:84%
with making it as
simple as possible.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we've found
in the last few months

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.985 align:middle line:84%
is that we've now produced
an essential oil mixture

00:48:37.985 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that I call Bliss, and
that is specifically

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:90%
for the ring of air.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there, you could just
take this little bottle,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:90%
which is roll on.

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.007 align:middle line:84%
It has a, to me,
a blissful smell.

00:48:53.007 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.147 align:middle line:84%
That smell's
combination of-- what

00:48:57.147 --> 00:48:58.470 align:middle line:90%
are the oils that's in that?

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: A bunch of
oils, five different oils.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.498 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, yeah.

00:49:00.498 --> 00:49:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: One of them is
exquisitely rare, and even more

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.564 align:middle line:84%
expensive than rose oil,
which is expensive enough.

00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which has a
very high frequency.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.688 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Right,
and this other one

00:49:09.688 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is even higher
frequency than rose oil.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And you just, like you
start off at the big toe.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I actually
want to do a whole--

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.110 align:middle line:84%
a whole demonstration
of this later.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Because this one will take
us to a different place,

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:23.830 align:middle line:90%
which is great.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:84%
This is really, really
good, the Bliss one is.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
ring, there's five.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to complete that.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Water.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Water,
the ring of water.

00:49:30.475 --> 00:49:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Now can you do all five
of these rings in a row?

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you do them on separate days?

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: In general, if
you just maintain health,

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I would do one a day and
start over, a circuit.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's total balance.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now if you've got an
illness that specifically needs

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:84%
it, like osteoporosis
and pain, you're

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:84%
going to concentrate
probably on fire and earth.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:84%
If you've got autism, you
concentrate on earth and air.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.875 align:middle line:84%
I had a little four-year-old
boy, I'm sorry,

00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:10.495 align:middle line:84%
an eight-year-old boy,
who spoke 50 words.

00:50:10.495 --> 00:50:13.744 align:middle line:84%
I had his mother start
stimulating the ring of air

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and the ring of earth.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Within three weeks he
was speaking 450 words.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.719 align:middle line:84%
Within three months
he was a chatterbox.

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By stimulating
the meridians.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.885 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Just by
stimulating these two

00:50:25.885 --> 00:50:27.790 align:middle line:90%
circuits in an autistic child.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:84%
His neurologist was so impressed
he bought the equipment

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.502 align:middle line:84%
to start stimulating
his patients with it.

00:50:32.502 --> 00:50:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, that's wonderful.

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.460 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
can be done at home.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once again,
this is safe.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:90%
This is effective.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.167 align:middle line:90%
Any side effects?

00:50:40.167 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: None.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I couldn't imagine.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.597 align:middle line:84%
And this is also, I mean,
it's safe, cost effective,

00:50:45.597 --> 00:50:47.721 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't take a lot of
time, something you can do

00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:48.935 align:middle line:90%
and empower yourself at home.

00:50:48.935 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Absolutely.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, these
are very good.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So you were mentioning
the ring of water.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Ring of water
raises aldosterone.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it normalizes
aldosterone.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The two abnormalities
of aldosterone

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.620 align:middle line:84%
that occur as part of disease
are excess or deficiency.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So in congestive heart
failure, for instance,

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you have a problem with
aldosterone metabolism,

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.932 align:middle line:90%
another adrenal hormone.

00:51:12.932 --> 00:51:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that with that is?

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.556 align:middle line:84%
Aldosterone is an
adrenal hormone?

00:51:15.556 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It balances
water and potassium.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got swelling
of the legs, for instance,

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.150 align:middle line:90%
this would be one to do.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:25.430 align:middle line:90%
It also is for emotions.

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so
the ring of water

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is specifically
for people who've

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.000 align:middle line:84%
got emotional distress
and heart distress.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is it
also depression?

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Not as
much, it certainly--

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.785 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's more so distress.

00:51:40.785 --> 00:51:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It's more for stress.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.362 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And for burnout
in a different sense.

00:51:45.362 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so there's
definitely a difference.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
one that you said

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is used for, I mean, people
with heart conditions,

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:90%
heart disease?

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Congestive
heart failure, especially,

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.430 align:middle line:90%
high blood pressure.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Any of those things like that
would be good for this one.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wonderful,
really wonderful.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:04.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right, so
what are these rings?

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well, we start--

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Another demonstration.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: This is the only
place, other than here,

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.620 align:middle line:84%
where there's a duplication,
spleen four, the one here

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.990 align:middle line:90%
on the foot.

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Because water is a crystal.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And so it starts off with that.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The actual
formation of water.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Exactly,
from right here.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Norm's doing all
of the feet tapping

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.730 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want
to take the boots off.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.616 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That's all
right, that's OK.

And so people, of course-- you
were going to say something?

00:55:00.887 --> 00:55:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, yeah,
I wanted to say,

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, because of
the complexity of doing this

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:08.230 align:middle line:84%
electrically, that's
why I've worked

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.130 align:middle line:90%
on developing essential oils.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I've now-- next
week I'm actually

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:84%
going to test my new
oil mixture for fire.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And the week after
that, my new oil

mixture for calcitonin
for the ring of Earth.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I think these
frequencies of the oils

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:29.310 align:middle line:84%
can complement and
intensify application

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.285 align:middle line:90%
to the specific points.

00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
we're going to do

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.660 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to go into
that demonstration of using

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.220 align:middle line:84%
the oils, finding out
what their application is,

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.990 align:middle line:84%

of each oil is.

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:42.824 align:middle line:84%

Doctor Shealy, in your

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.316 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the
biggest complaint's

00:55:50.316 --> 00:55:51.490 align:middle line:90%
that you hear from patients?

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well the most
common is depression, anxiety,

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and number three is cholesterol.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, you know,
it's such a plague

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that is the pharmaco
mafia's approach to it.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.916 align:middle line:84%
They put everybody
on a statin drug.

00:56:05.916 --> 00:56:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I used to say you couldn't
pay me a billion dollars

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:08.930 align:middle line:90%
to take one.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And now I'll say a trillion.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:14.136 align:middle line:84%
I would not take a statin
drug for $1 trillion

00:56:14.136 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because it damages your
kidney, your liver,

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.870 align:middle line:84%
your peripheral nervous
system, your muscle, including

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.510 align:middle line:84%
your heart muscle,
and your brain.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
they're not so bad.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.111 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, wait.

00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:27.165 align:middle line:84%

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Congestive heart failure
has doubled in frequency

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.730 align:middle line:90%
since the onset of statin drugs.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's paying attention to it.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Peripheral nerve damage,
muscle weakness and pain.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.795 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many safe
ways to lower cholesterol.

00:56:50.795 --> 00:56:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk about that.

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to
invalidate all the people

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that are on these.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
that are on them.

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:56.936 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: If they're
going to take them,

00:56:56.936 --> 00:57:00.380 align:middle line:90%
they must add CoQ10, ubiquinol.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:04.839 align:middle line:84%
It will help prevent many
of the complications.

00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the drug companies
knew this originally,

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.960 align:middle line:84%
but they never tell
anybody about it.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some physicians do
know that, to add CoQ10.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.670 align:middle line:90%
And how much?

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well a minimum
of 100 to 200 milligrams

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.094 align:middle line:90%
if you're taking a statin drug.

00:57:17.094 --> 00:57:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But even with that,
I wouldn't take one,

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.593 align:middle line:84%
because there's certain
things you could do,

00:57:20.593 --> 00:57:24.090 align:middle line:84%
like the beta sitosterol,
a natural sterol that

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:25.610 align:middle line:90%
comes out of vegetables.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:26.650 align:middle line:90%
It works fine.

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where do you
get something like?

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: At a
health food store.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beta?

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:84%

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:84%
400 milligrams,
three times a day.

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Now the one that works
at least as well,

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and infinitely safer, and
has been around for 50 years,

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.930 align:middle line:90%
is timed release niacin.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Statistically speaking, just
as effective without any

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:49.860 align:middle line:90%

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vitamin B, basically.

it's that kind of thing.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Lecithin, lecithin
helps lower it.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It emulsifies fat.

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.400 align:middle line:90%
So it helps.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.342 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mm, lowers

and, OK, what else?

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt you.

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well
L-arginine, an amino acid.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.210 align:middle line:90%
That can help lower it.

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Taurine, another amino acid.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.910 align:middle line:90%

going to-- taking those five

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.730 align:middle line:84%
different supplements, could
you feasibly, or have you

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:26.550 align:middle line:84%
seen people in your
clinical experience

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:28.383 align:middle line:84%
reduce the amount of
statin drugs they take?

00:58:28.383 --> 00:58:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Off.

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Not reduce, off.

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:33.340 align:middle line:84%
What I suggest is, if you
really have a big problem

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.630 align:middle line:84%
to start with, start with
time released niacin.

00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:40.816 align:middle line:84%
After one week cut your
statin drug in half.

00:58:40.816 --> 00:58:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And continue
to do tests,

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.648 align:middle line:84%
around cholesterol
tests and stuff?

00:58:43.648 --> 00:58:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Don't test yet.

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:45.529 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:45.529 --> 00:58:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Cut it in half.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:49.440 align:middle line:84%
After another two weeks,
stop the statin drug.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And then a few weeks later
check your cholesterol.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The chances are you're going
to be at least as good, if not

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.711 align:middle line:84%
better, than when you
were on a statin drug.

00:58:57.711 --> 00:58:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes I get
concerned about telling people

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to get off of
their statin drugs.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well you
have to ween off,

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.331 align:middle line:84%
come off slowly, over a
period two to four weeks.

00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:07.955 align:middle line:84%
Same is true with
antidepressant drugs.

00:59:07.955 --> 00:59:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Lets talk about
that, antidepressants.

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.360 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well I've
weened thousands

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:15.350 align:middle line:84%
of people off antidepressant
drugs, and again, same thing.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I start with using something
like the Liss cranial

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:20.950 align:middle line:90%
stimulator.

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And today I would start with the
Bliss because it works so well.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And then after a couple of
weeks, cut your antidepressant

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:31.170 align:middle line:84%
drug in half, continue
doing the alternatives.

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:34.924 align:middle line:84%
After four weeks stop
the antidepressant drug.

00:59:34.924 --> 00:59:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing well,
you don't need it anymore.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:38.923 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now the Liss
we talked about earlier

00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and we saw the demonstration
on the video earlier.

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.029 align:middle line:90%
You need a--

00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: A prescription.

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --prescription in

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:49.395 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:59:49.395 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well your
FDA-- your FDA--

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My personal FDA.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:57.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --requires it.

00:59:57.522 --> 00:59:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It requires it.

00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.659 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Every other
country in the world

01:00:00.659 --> 01:00:01.770 align:middle line:90%
they're over the counter.

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.657 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Only in this country.

01:00:03.657 --> 01:00:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you buy them online?

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, you can buy them
in department stores, even.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yeah.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Liss device?

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And regular TENS, too.

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
TENS units, right.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: In Tokyo, go to the
department store and buy them.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.238 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, or you can
get a prescription,

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.030 align:middle line:84%
most doctors won't
know what it is,

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.960 align:middle line:84%
so they don't know what
they're prescribing.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That's
the real problem.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.110 align:middle line:90%
But holistic physicians will.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.202 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, of course.

01:00:24.202 --> 01:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they can look on your
website to do the research--

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:28.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --which is normshealy?

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:29.726 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Normshealy.com

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Normshealy.com.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:34.941 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that and now
I want to really

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
talk about the depression
for a little bit here.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there's, as we
talked about earlier,

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial depression,
chemical depression,

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:90%
genetic depression.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.359 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
exactly is the Bliss?

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
you've come up with.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:49.191 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It is something
that I've come up with.

01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a mixture of five very
specific essential oils

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
that are rare and,
in combination,

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
work synergistically to activate
this particular circuit.

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously you can have some
effect just from smelling it.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But when you
put it on these points,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the oils
goes into the acupuncture--

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
you could put it on one point
and within a minute or less

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
you'll taste it.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
that's interesting.

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So it goes through the body.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What is it about the blend
of those essential oils,

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.427 align:middle line:90%
and what are they?

01:01:27.427 --> 01:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well I can't
tell you one of them.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And the reason for
that is that it's so rare,

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and I have been ripped
off a few times.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not giving this one away.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Each of
the oils that I'm

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
developing for specific rings
will be a combination of things

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
that I intuitively have chosen.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm just
curious as to how

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.312 align:middle line:84%
you went from a neurosurgeon
to using essential oils.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
you know, I started

01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
with transcutaneous
electrical nerve

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
stimulation, and dorsal
column stimulation,

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
and those were intuitive gifts.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
They came out of the
sky, if you will.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And combined with
your vast body of knowledge.

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, you know, I've
been at this for 50 years.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so, now I
can put together an oil

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and then test it.

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And I can test it chemically.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And we've tested this one.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it does
raise oxytocin as well

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.125 align:middle line:90%
as neurotensin.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:32.384 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am
smelling baby powder.

01:02:32.384 --> 01:02:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well--

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know
it's not in there.

01:02:34.996 --> 01:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: There's
no baby powder.

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a blend of--
interestingly I've only

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
had two people out of hundreds
who think it's too strong.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Even though it's
sweet, most men-- it has enough

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
muskiness into it that
most men like it too.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And people
are sleeping better

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.770 align:middle line:90%
by doing it at bedtime.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
For someone who needs it
for depression especially,

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:01.797 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety, I say
use it at bedtime

01:03:01.797 --> 01:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and use it first
thing in the morning.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They should use
it on airplanes, red eyes.

01:03:05.545 --> 01:03:07.045 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I think
we should spray it

01:03:07.045 --> 01:03:09.985 align:middle line:90%
over cities all over the world.

01:03:09.985 --> 01:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right,
so we're going

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.490 align:middle line:90%
to do a demonstration of it.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:14.489 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to personally
do the demonstration

01:03:14.489 --> 01:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
because I won't be
able to say a word.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's important
because it gets you

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
into-- what type of
state is desired?

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well it's
that simultaneity

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
of thought, detached,
being at peace.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.050 align:middle line:90%
You know--

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coherence.

>>LISA: OK, OK, all right.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And these specific points
on the body, you have chosen

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.470 align:middle line:90%
or you have done--

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: We worked
those out originally.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so we start down
at the tip of the big toe,

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.616 align:middle line:90%
by the nail, at the very tip.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you do.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you go on
top of the foot.

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.293 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Doctor Shealy's
doing it through his socks

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I just have to loosen that
enough to go inside my pants.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see, OK.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.222 align:middle line:84%
Well where we're
going is right here.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:19.763 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The very
base of the spine.

01:04:19.763 --> 01:04:20.344 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:04:20.344 --> 01:04:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right there.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: On the
base of the spine.

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is also known
as the first chakra.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Survivalistic
point of body.

01:04:26.235 --> 01:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it comes up to the
top of the spine, just below.

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, OK,
right back here, OK.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then, if I
were doing it in sequence,

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to the point just
below the collar bone.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.792 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That should be tender.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.994 align:middle line:84%
If it's not tender,
you're not on the point.

01:04:42.994 --> 01:04:44.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yeah, that's tender.

01:04:44.285 --> 01:04:45.868 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That is
tender in everybody.

01:04:45.868 --> 01:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And then halfway across
the base of the skull.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Both points on
the base of the skull.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And then the top.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know, on one
my radio shows back

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
every Thursday, Vince Finelli
and I start the show saying,

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.930 align:middle line:90%
we just Blissed out.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
show for the '60s.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
This is an experience that
is-- it's definitely worth

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.770 align:middle line:90%
experiencing.

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that enables

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.830 align:middle line:90%
you to be in a positive state.

01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right, and--

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A clearer state.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:21.955 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --balanced.

01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
What I would call
truly harmonious.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you could
combine that with imagery.

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:34.685 align:middle line:84%
And I love the imagery of
this particular ring, which

01:05:34.685 --> 01:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd be happy to guide
you through, if you like.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is wonderful.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you are master
in guided imagery.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Another word for
visualization, this is--

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I love that you are
able to guide us through this.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.661 align:middle line:84%
Because not only do you
have years of experience,

01:05:47.661 --> 01:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
but you have been
doing guided imagery,

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
you know what it
does to the brain.

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And explain to people,
what exactly does it do?

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well
actually, you know,

01:05:56.930 --> 01:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the very mention
of a word activates

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
certain specific
areas of the brain.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
That's been demonstrated
with PET scans.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
words are symbols.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Words are substitutes.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For example, what
words would stimulate?

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Hand, but if you
were French you'd say ma main,

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
instead of my hand.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But you would be trained so
you'd have the same reaction

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
with ma main that you
and I get with my hand.

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And chair.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:32.505 align:middle line:84%
Each of these has a-- is
a symbol for an imagery

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:35.380 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our mind.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But we learned that-- maybe
the little child, what that?

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:38.720 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.257 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

01:06:39.257 --> 01:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that's
how you learn.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So with the ring of air-- I love
this because you're using air.

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
imagine that you're

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
breathing in through the skin at
the tips of your big toe nails.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And the air comes into
the center of you feet,

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:01.020 align:middle line:90%
and goes out again.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And with every breath
you breathe air.

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
You're activating
that energy circuit

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
by breathing into the
point, into the foot itself,

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you move over on
the top of the foot.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the liver three point.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And you breathe in, direct it
through the top of your foot,

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
between the big toe and the
next toe on the top of the foot,

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
breathe into the center of
the foot, and back out again.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now when you're using
this visual-- you could call

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
it visualization, you could
call it guided imagery,

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- I know that
they've used the study of words

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
on water.

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Emoto did an
amazing study around that.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So the power of words
really makes it--

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and scientific
evidence has shown

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.790 align:middle line:90%
that it makes a great impact.

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:50.957 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Tremendous impact.

01:07:50.957 --> 01:07:53.331 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what about when
you're thinking of it in your

01:07:53.331 --> 01:07:54.025 align:middle line:90%
head?

01:07:54.025 --> 01:07:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Same thing.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:07:55.525 --> 01:07:56.595 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Absolutely.

01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:57.840 align:middle line:90%
It's no different.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a wonderful
story about Moliere, Le Malade

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:06.895 align:middle line:90%
Imaginaire, the hypochondriac.

01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And theoretically
he played the role

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.680 align:middle line:90%
so well that he died on stage.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I mean, but
words are that important--

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.453 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:16.634 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And can be.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure
actors have experienced

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.196 align:middle line:84%
that, where they
become the role.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: You know, Lindsay
Wagner, The Bionic Woman,

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.470 align:middle line:90%
was a friend of mine.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.819 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, Lindsay,
I didn't even

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
know sometimes how
to say something.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.243 align:middle line:90%
I'm always playing a role.

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:35.037 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

01:08:35.037 --> 01:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because she started
when she was very, very young,

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.529 align:middle line:90%
acting.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.916 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That might make a lot of
sense for a lot of child actors

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.880 align:middle line:84%
who become, and assume,
and lose their identity

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
through what they're
actually doing.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And people can really
sometimes convince

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.100 align:middle line:90%
themselves of anything.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.674 align:middle line:84%
And that-- it's a little
bit scary sometimes.

01:08:50.674 --> 01:08:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It is.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.899 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk yourself
into negative stuff as well.

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:54.399 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.312 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That's why it doesn't
pay to focus on negativity.

01:08:57.312 --> 01:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, because
you can absolutely

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.109 align:middle line:84%
do the same thing in
terms of talking yourself

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:04.684 align:middle line:84%
into a positive state and
into a desired state, which

01:09:04.684 --> 01:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
is one of things that
the guided imagery does.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.475 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Absolutely.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.649 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've used this for
years with goal setting,

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
with anything that has to do
with relationships, peace.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many studies
that have been done on this.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.319 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's go
back to the beginning

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:28.399 align:middle line:84%
of modern use of
this kind of thing.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in the late
1800's hypnosis came in.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:32.790 align:middle line:90%
It was very big.

01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:33.399 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.189 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But Freud was
a terrible hypnotist.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he
created his stuff.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.729 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But the
people who were good

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
at it, like Schultz,
Johannes Schultz in Germany,

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
created something called
autogenic training.

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And his point was when
he hypnotized people,

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.610 align:middle line:90%
they became dependent upon him.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And he didn't want
them to be dependent upon him.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to do it at home.

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So he created the phrases
that people told him

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
they felt as they drifted
into a hypnotic state.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:17.909 align:middle line:84%
And so it begins with my arms
and legs are heavy and warm.

01:10:17.909 --> 01:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this was the
feedback that he got from his--

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --his patients.

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
In the brain, from
knowing what you

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
know as a neurosurgeon,
what is the actual response,

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
or neural connection,
that happens

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
when you have words associated
and images associated?

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It begins to
translate directly in the brain,

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.710 align:middle line:90%
as if it's already happened.

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you could train
yourself to warm your hand just

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:47.182 align:middle line:90%
by thinking my hand is warm.

01:10:47.182 --> 01:10:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you really?

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And in a child,
12 years and younger,

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the first time you ask them
to do it, they can do it.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
My 12-year-old
son, for instance,

01:10:56.610 --> 01:10:57.984 align:middle line:84%
came in one day,
Dad what's that?

01:10:57.984 --> 01:10:58.942 align:middle line:90%
Biofeedback device.

01:10:58.942 --> 01:10:59.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, warm your hand.

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.139 align:middle line:84%
OK, warm your hand
up 10 degrees.

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Less than a minute, he
said, OK I did that.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:05.638 align:middle line:90%
What do I do now?

01:11:05.638 --> 01:11:08.591 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK cool you hand,
lower it 10 degrees.

01:11:08.591 --> 01:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
A minute later he said,
OK I've done that.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.354 align:middle line:90%
Out of the room.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's how quickly a
child can learn to do this.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Now for adults it may
then them a week or two.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But, going
back to migraine,

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
which we talked about
earlier, 84% of people

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
who learn temperature
control of the hands

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
can bring their migraines
under control doing that.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
just a good exercise.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Wait, why does it take
adults so much longer?

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well we have all the
inhibitions, and our fears,

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
that have accumulated

01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:43.970 align:middle line:90%
through our years of work.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.464 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
individuals we're different.

01:11:46.464 --> 01:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Some people learn it faster.

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
hand, as 1969 there

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
were 2,600 scientific references
on autogenic training showing

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.789 align:middle line:84%
that 80% of people
with stress illnesses

01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
could bring them under control
with autogenic training.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is training
with basically your mind

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: These words,
words and images.

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
80% of students do
better in school.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
80% of business people
do better in business.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
80% of athletes do
better in athletics.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
For instance, way
back in the late '70s,

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the football team at University
of Wisconsin La Crosse

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:29.580 align:middle line:90%
was at the bottom of its league.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I gave them six sessions
in using autogenic training

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and visualization.

01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
They were co-champions
that year.

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Wow, well this is from a master.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's ideal.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And the girls
basketball coach then

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
had me make a tape for
the girls basketball team.

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
He got his Master's
degree working on this.

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And half of the girls were
given the tape, guided imagery.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They were 84% better
at free throws

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
than those who just practiced.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.555 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have you trained
in this for a long time?

01:13:04.555 --> 01:13:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Guided, I mean, did--

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Since the early '70s.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:07.423 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you have.

01:13:07.423 --> 01:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And you've learned the
phrases, and what works,

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and what's been used.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And then you take
a computerized brain map,

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
which brings you color
pictures of what's

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
brain, and within

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
a minute you can put
yourself into an alpha state,

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
with a lovely mandala,
or into a state of theta,

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
which is guided
imagery itself, which

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
is a very different mandala.

01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
on a computer EEG.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well with
all of that evidence

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
this experience of being

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.839 align:middle line:84%
able to do this right
now, with you guiding us.

01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: OK.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.504 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which I'm very, very
excited about and grateful for.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of you,
of course, at home

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able to just get
into a relaxed state, and feet

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%
firmly on the ground?

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the best
way for people to sit?

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:55.837 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh I think,
be comfortable.

01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:59.142 align:middle line:84%
A recliner is good,
although some people

01:13:59.142 --> 01:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
are going to fall asleep
if they close their eyes.

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you have trouble staying
awake, keep your eyes open

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
but focus on something that
doesn't have any emotion to it.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, all right, so
focus on something positive.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And shall
I do the ring of air?

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what exactly are people
going to experience, here?

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, you are going
to activate that system that

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
controls neurotensin
and oxytocin.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.102 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do
it with imagery.

01:14:26.102 --> 01:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and so this is
something that will get us

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:30.040 align:middle line:90%
into a place of bliss--

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: A place of bliss.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and peace.

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so
close your eyes.

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Take a deep
breath, and let it go.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And just be aware that you
are a living, energetic being.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body is
just functioning energy.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you're
breathing in and out

01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
through the tips of the
insides of your big toe.

01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And the air comes into
the center of your feet,

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:07.935 align:middle line:84%
Every breath into the
center and out again.

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Into the center and out again.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Move your attention up over
the top of your foot, now,

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
both sides.

01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Just between the big toe and
the next toe, and imagine you're

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
breathing directly into
the center of your foot

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Directly into the center
of your foot and out again.

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Directly into the center
of your foot and out again.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And move your attention up
the outsides of your calves,

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:46.180 align:middle line:84%
to the very top outside the
tibia, or the shin bone.

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you're
breathing into this area,

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:54.130 align:middle line:84%
right into the center of your
calf, and back out again.

01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:57.572 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in the tops of
your calves, into the center,

01:15:57.572 --> 01:15:59.780 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Breathing into the top center
of your calf and out again.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Move your attention now
up to your tail bone,

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and imagine you're breathing
in through the bottom

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.332 align:middle line:84%
of your spine, the
tail bone itself.

01:16:13.332 --> 01:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe in, the
air comes all the way up

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to the top of your
spine and out.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the next breath, you
breathe in at the top

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of your spine, all the
way your spinal canal

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and out at the tail bone.

01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Take another breath in the
bottom of your tailbone,

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
up to the top of
your spine and out.

01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:38.680 align:middle line:84%
In the top of your spine,
down and out at the tail bone.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
One more time, bringing the
Kundalini all the way up,

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:45.435 align:middle line:84%
from the tail bone as
the air comes in, out

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.490 align:middle line:90%
of the top of your spine.

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:51.045 align:middle line:84%
In at the top of your
spine, back down and out

01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
at the tail bone.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now go to the points
on your chest,

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
just below your collar
bone and at the junction

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
with the shoulder.

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in, and
here imagine you're

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
breathing into the
lungs themselves

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
through this point on
your upper outer chest,

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
right into the lungs,
filling them, and out again.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in and out again.

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:26.175 align:middle line:84%
In, filling your
lungs, and out again.

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Now move your attention up,
on the base of your skull,

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
right halfway between the
mastoid and the center,

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and breathe directly into
the base of your skull.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And the air comes all
the way into the center

01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
under the base of the
brain, and out again.

01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:49.216 align:middle line:84%
Into the center, the underside
of the base of your skull,

01:17:49.216 --> 01:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Into the base of the skull, all
the way through, and out again.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Now move your attention up to
the top, center of your head,

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
above your ears.

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're breathing
in through the top center

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
of your skull.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Now the air goes
all the way down

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:13.900 align:middle line:84%
the brain and spine
and out the tail bone.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.495 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in at the tail bone,
all the way up the spine

01:18:16.495 --> 01:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and through the brain,
and out the top center.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the top
center of your brain

01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:29.288 align:middle line:84%
head, down to the base of
the spine, and back up again.

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And finally now, you

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Be aware and imagine
you're breathing directly

01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:42.945 align:middle line:84%
into the body through the
points from the toes, the feet,

01:18:42.945 --> 01:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the calves, the spine, the
lungs, the base of the skull,

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
all of them coming in together
at same time, and out again.

01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
All of them coming into
the center of your body

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.348 align:middle line:90%
and out again.

01:18:57.348 --> 01:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
all of them coming

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
in to the center of
your body and out again.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now just stop for a
moment and feel, sense,

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
know how it feels to be
in this state of feeling

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
totally comfortable, at peace
with the world, with your body,

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
with your mind,
with your emotions.

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:34.262 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

01:19:34.262 --> 01:19:36.902 align:middle line:90%
And it is a good thing to do.

01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%


01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.965 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is a perfect
thing to do if you're ever

01:19:42.965 --> 01:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in a place of anxiety or stress,
if you have localized pain

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
in your body, if you
have a headache or--

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I'm glad you brought
up that one, by the way.

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I learned this
many, many years ago

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
when I was developing my whole
concept of mental retraining.

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I read a book by an
East Indian, and he

01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:09.230 align:middle line:84%
said the first day
you do not breathe

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
through a part of the
body it starts to die.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is the first
day you don't balance, and get

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
rid of the stress that gets
accumulated in the body,

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:22.200 align:middle line:90%
the cells begin to have trouble.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Along with Wilhelm Reich,
the great psychiatrist

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
who talked about building
up-- armoring in the body.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I was on a trip, and
I had a little sore throat.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I just sat there for
15 minutes just breathing

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.206 align:middle line:84%
in and out, total
control of the pain.

01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And by learning to do
it in a part of the body

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have difficulty,
then if you have difficulty,

01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and it may take 15 minutes,
but you can actually

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.042 align:middle line:90%
make that part of the body numb.

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, there's an enormous
amount of research on the power

01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:55.701 align:middle line:90%

01:20:58.971 --> 01:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Very
important, obviously.

of the cortisol release, and

it sets off the
free radicals, it

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
starts to damage cells
and inhibit reproduction

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of healthy cells, and so forth.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That whole cascading
effect that happens

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
in the body with stress.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we sit with that,
that's what gives us the pain,

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.374 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:21:22.374 --> 01:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And
there's no question.

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean Reich said when
muscles go into spasm,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
it cuts off the blood flow.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.430 align:middle line:90%
And he's right.

01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
A gynecologist in Carmel,
California, back in the '70s,

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
showed that women
who were non-orgasmic

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.020 align:middle line:84%
had a decreased
temperature in the vagina.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
He gave them a tampon
thermometer, no psychotherapy,

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and just taught them to warm the
tissue of the vagina to normal,

01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and they became orgasmic
with no psychotherapy.

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what exactly are
the effects, in the body,

01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of stress?

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, exactly
what happens when

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
the body goes through
that type of stress?

01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.927 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, you
raise cortisol--

01:22:03.927 --> 01:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Uh huh, which
is the stress hormone.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.426 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: --which is
the stress hormone.

01:22:07.426 --> 01:22:08.630 align:middle line:90%
You raise adrenaline.

01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
That causes the
pancreas to go in,

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.470 align:middle line:84%
because the adrenaline
raises blood sugar, which

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
you release from the liver.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The pancreas then has to kick in
to bring the blood sugar down.

01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The adrenaline
also causes, then,

01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and the cortisol, you
need to produce DHEA.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
burnout happens, when

01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that pathway between cortisol
and DHEA begins to burnout.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It can't handle it anymore.

01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we had the running
from the tiger experience.

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But now we're constantly
running from the traffic.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.779 align:middle line:84%
And we're running from the--
whatever stressors, fears,

01:22:40.779 --> 01:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that are being fed to
us through the media.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're running through
the convenience store

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
markets and all that.

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.550 align:middle line:84%

>>SHEALY: Exactly.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.530 align:middle line:84%

on the ring of

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I had two men who didn't get
any response in six weeks.

01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%

fact that a thought

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:43.040 align:middle line:90%
sets a prayer in motion.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely love that.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that there's
over 50 devices and techniques

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and exercises that
alleviate pain, stress.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Migraines, pain
management, mostly.

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that's
why I honestly

01:26:08.770 --> 01:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
know that 85% of the time people
don't need drugs or surgery.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've got
an acute illness,

01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that's what physicians
can do best.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a broken bone,
you need an orthopedist.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.565 align:middle line:84%
If you've got appendicitis,
you need a surgeon.

01:26:25.565 --> 01:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that
is what I wanted

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
to do today, was to get
that knowledge from you

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
into the minds of people
so that they have choice,

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
they have awareness, and
that they can do something

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.440 align:middle line:90%
about their pain.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's many, many
choices around it.

01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And
remember, you are good.

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because God does
not create junk.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I remember
you saying that years ago.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Doctor

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for imparting
your knowledge on us today.

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It was definitely necessary.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.860 align:middle line:90%
My hands are warm.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:04.177 align:middle line:84%
See I've been telling
myself , my hands are warm.
