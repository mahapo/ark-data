00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaia Inspirations.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:10%
And our topic for this series,
taped at the Celebrate Your

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.900 align:middle line:10%
Life Conference, here
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:10%
is to explore the I Am meaning.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I have learned is that
the I Am statement puts motion

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
into the universe of what it
is that we want to create.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what my
guest Dr. Sue Morter teaches,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:90%
with bioenergetic medicine.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
She redirects the flow of
energy patterns in the body

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to activate our full
human potential.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.192 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to have you here.

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:46.066 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. SUE MORTER: It's
tremendous to be here.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It's always a delight
to be with you, Lisa.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.524 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are glowing.

00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:52.025 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's
because I'm with you.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:52.774 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're creating a
bioenergetic field right here.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: This is it.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is it.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: We're in
the high frequencies.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So the I Am statement, what
does that feel like to you,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
when you hear those words, I am?

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: Well, the
bottom line of I Am

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:10%
is that it brings us
into pure presence.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:10%
And the truth of
us is residing very

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:10%
deep at the core of our being.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:10%
And anything that we are
claiming from that place

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
is really moving into action
the truth of our deep essence.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we are in our core
and in our heart space

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and coming from our deep
place of wisdom, and we say,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I am anything, what happens
is the very cells of our being

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
are following orders.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.626 align:middle line:90%
So they align to the frequency.

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They align to the energy
of whatever that is.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So I have a tendency to be
very careful and very conscious

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
when I'm making
an I Am statement.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Because pretty much anything
that you follow those

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
two words with is a declaration
of a complete identity

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.441 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's the
universe is listening,

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
when you hear those
words, I am, yes?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And it really does.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Every time I say it, it brings
the whole present, the moment,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
into present time,
which is amazing.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So that explains frequency,
which is what you work with.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
You work with frequency and
bioenergetics and the field

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
outside of our bodies and the
field that we're in right now.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me about
how you discovered

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
this, a little bit
of your background,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and what you teach people to
use this frequency to do with?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: So I was
raised in an environment

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
that this was the conversation.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a natural
health care environment, where

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:90%
bioenergetics was our life.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
My father was one of
the founders, really,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:90%
of energy medicine.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
He was in the foreground
there in the early '70s.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And so long before energy
was popular to talk about--

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.771 align:middle line:84%
and he was actually ridiculed
for discussing it and talking

00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But he developed
an energy technique

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that is about raising
the vibrational frequency

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
of the internal system
and removing anything

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:90%
that drops that frequency.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in
that conversation.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I grew up
and graduated from school

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and opened my own practice and
started working with patients,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that
there is so much

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can do within
ourselves to raise or lower

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.024 align:middle line:90%
our own vibrational frequencies.

00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I became
very, very curious

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
about the various modalities
around the world that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
were ancient, ancient practices,
and that were emerging

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in the course of my
lifetime, and just

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
started weaving things together
that I found were helping me

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to anchor and embody
some of the principles

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that I had learned to
actually become that and put

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
it to practice in my life.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It took something more than
just thinking about it,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:90%
than just holding an intention.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Those things are
very, very valuable.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:90%
But there was even more to that.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So dropping into the core and
allowing the cellular structure

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to feel the different
vibrational frequencies that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
are available to us is a huge
part of where we're headed.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you seen
this conversation

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
become more and more popular and
in so many more people's living

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:90%
rooms these days?

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.665 align:middle line:90%
And isn't it exciting?

00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yeah.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing to me.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't it?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.659 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yeah, when I opened
my practice about 30 years ago,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I never even told people that I
was working with their energy,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when I said
the word energy,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
people thought I
was only referring

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
to having enough energy
to get through the day.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
If the energy is flowing
through the body the way

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to, we
will have more energy

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.241 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day than we
do at the beginning of the day.

00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not, then we
begin to get exhausted,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to get
fried, and we begin to age

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and feel older, and
these types of things.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thrilled
that in our lifetime,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
this is becoming a
common conversation,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
because there is such a deep
truth here available to us.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.506 align:middle line:90%
Then, in terms of self-healing--

00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Self-healing.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Self-referring,
abundant living,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
really transforming our culture,
our community, and our world,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and becoming highly
conscious, all of that

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:90%
is truly based in energetics.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And bioenergetics is how we
embody that for ourselves.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it starts
with the field,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and it can go out to others.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, it can even go out
to a planetary perspective

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.744 align:middle line:90%
and then come back to us.

00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's start
with talking about

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:90%
our own bioenergetic field.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
What does it look like
when we get off balance,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
when things get
into our field that

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
are not in an alignment
with our frequency?

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we allow
it to stick to us?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Well,
there are things that

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
come from the external,
external environment, that

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
can influence our
electromagnetic energy field.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of the interferences
in our energy field

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
come from our own
unresolved subconsciousness,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
meaning if we experience
things that we don't

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
know how to deal with, we
stick them in our pocket,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:90%
and we keep going.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Because life is demanding, and
it calls us to stay in action,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:90%
so we think.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're just trying to
do the best that we can do.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that in that
way, what ends up happening is,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.549 align:middle line:84%
we step aside, and we stick
things in our back pocket,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking, oh, I'll
get to that later.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.036 align:middle line:84%
I'll get to that
when I learn how to.

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to deal
with this right now,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.951 align:middle line:90%
but I have to keep going.

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
reason that things

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
get stuck in our energy field,
and it stops the flow of energy

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
through our body.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
When that energy flow
stops, we get sick.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It decreases our vital force.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It allows cellular breakdown.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It creates all kinds of
immune system situations,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
All of it is because of energy
being blocked in this field.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.429 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
epigenetics is teaching us

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that our environment
is even more important

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:90%
than our genetic inheritance.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And our environment begins
with the cloud of energy

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that we hold around us
as are unconsciousness,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
our subconsciousness.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
That is our immediate
environment.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And if it's filled
with unresolved-ness,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:90%
then I'm basically polluted.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking around in an
environment that is polluted.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And so my system is going
to suffer because of that.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.367 align:middle line:84%
And so that's very interesting,
because I was thinking,

00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:90%
oh, it comes from outside of us.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.325 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It really starts with-- is this
true that it starts with inside

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of us, and then the
other energies outside

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
match that frequency
that's unresolved?

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Truly,
when we are emitting

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
an energy essence,
an energy field,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because of our own
unresolved-ness, for instance,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
then we attract vibrational
frequencies that

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:90%
are a match to that.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So our life experiences end up
matching or reflecting to us

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
what's going on or what's not
going on in this inner world.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So the more we can clean
up the inner world,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:84%
then the more that we will
emit an energy field that's

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:90%
a higher vibrational frequency.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll attract circumstances
into our life that are

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.067 align:middle line:90%
a vibrational match to that.

00:07:58.067 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's really where
the law of attraction

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and those types of
things are coming from.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.226 align:middle line:84%
And I would really
love for people

00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it isn't
that we're an empty vessel,

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have to attract
great things into our life.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:90%
We're full.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how
much of our fullness

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
are we allowing to be
expressed outwardly?

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's being
reflected back to us

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
based upon what we are
radiating, what we're emanating

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:90%
as, what our resonance is.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
What our vibrational
frequency is,

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.101 align:middle line:84%
it creates the world
that we live in, for us.

Well, we live in a

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:10%
When you change the

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:10%

there's a ripple effect.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:10%
Energy is held together
in certain forms.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:10%
And we participate in that with

At the physical

The nervous system isn't the
only communication system

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.648 align:middle line:90%
that's happening.

It's not the only way
that our body runs itself.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.275 align:middle line:90%

I'm not in private practice,
private practice any longer.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But I remember, a few years
ago, when a 94-year-old person

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:90%
said this to me.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.924 align:middle line:90%
And it just reaffirmed to me.

00:10:59.924 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It reaffirmed what I've
been seeing all these years.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
it is instantaneous

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:90%
that transformation can occur.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious doesn't
know anything about time.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.567 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know anything
about what's possible,

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen tomorrow.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It only knows what is
happening in this moment,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.312 align:middle line:90%
and it responds to that.

00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So the universe, the whole
world, the physical world,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
responds accordingly
in the same way.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So when we shift gears,
instantly the energy field

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, the physical tissues
take a little while

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate and
rejuvenate in accordance

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
with this new template
that's being created,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
because we have finally
forgiven something,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
or we have finally come to terms
with our greatness in some way

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't know
about it before.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And we finally come
online, in a way,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that we get more of the truth
of the whole picture of why

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
we're here on the planet,
and these types of things.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So that template can
change in an instant.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The physical tissues take a
little bit longer sometimes,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:90%
but not always.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So I will say it can
be instantaneous.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the miraculous
healing that we see

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and that we know is
a very real thing.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And science is actually
giving us some explanations

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:90%
as to how that is true.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But I will also say that, not
only can it be instantaneously,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's never too late; no way.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
There is an entirely
different reality

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:90%
that we are dealing with.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Especially if we are stepping
into the deep truth of the I Am

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're speaking of, it's
not a world of relativity.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
The I Am world is a
world of absolute,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning I am who
I am, regardless

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening in
this external environment.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And if I can come
to know that, then I

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:84%
am the diffuser
of anything that's

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
coming toward me that is
of a dissident energy.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I will resonate with an energy
that can neutralize anything

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
when I am truly integrated
and connected at the deep core

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:90%

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%

have this amazing amount

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's
because of this I Am.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:84%
The I Am is a stream
of ever-replenishing,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:90%
rejuvenating.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
It's fountain of youth-ish, OK?

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%

the physical human system

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.526 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It comes in from
above your head.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It goes down through your
body, goes into the earth,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
rises back up from the earth,
comes back up through the body,

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
out the top of the head, and
recycles and recycles around,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
coming in at the
root of the spine,

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
back around and around again,
constantly being replenished

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and constantly being utilized.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is measurable.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
scientific and understood.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It forms this torus shape of
energy around the human system.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is our
responsibility, ultimately.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's our opportunity
to, at the very least,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to discover this, to find
this within ourselves.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not by looking outward
for the solutions in our life.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about coming,
reclaiming our resources,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
bringing our faculties
back into the inner realm

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and sensing and
feeling and trusting.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of
bits of information

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that are bombarding
us every millisecond.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are at choice
to respond to them.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Only a few of those
bits of information

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
can come up to the conscious
mind in a given moment.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The rest of them report
to our deep gut center.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if we are teaching
ourselves to listen to our gut

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
core, then we are in
constant receptivity

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
to this ever-changing flow
of information and energy.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It's all the same thing,
energy and information.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not consciously
concentrating

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:90%
on being energetic.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of what it feels
like to be dropped deep

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:90%
into that central core place.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And from that place, I'm
in constant receptivity

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
of this energy flow.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not using my own energy.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.056 align:middle line:84%
I'm borrowing it from the
universe and returning it.

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:08.908 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%
No, got it.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
When you come in
contact with people,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
do you feel or pick up on what's
going on with their bodies?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yes, instantly.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.287 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does this ever
impact your energy field?

00:15:19.287 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Or I should ask you, how does
it not impact your energy field?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Because I know that it doesn't.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Well, the
energy field, this flow,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
this stream of energy,
that I'm talking about,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that is ever-replenishing, it's
very potent and very powerful.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
high-frequency energy.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And it has the capacity to
neutralize other energies that

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
are around it,
that are less true,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that are-- and anytime
someone's caught up

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.945 align:middle line:84%
in a drama or a trauma
or an emotional situation

00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
in their life, it's not
the truth of who they are.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It's something they're trying
to work through and metabolize

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:90%
in any given moment.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we're coming from
this deep place of truth,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cut right
through the drama trauma

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that someone else
is engaging in.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's not going to affect me.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm probably going to
have a positive impact on it

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
just by stabilizing with
something more deeply resonant.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.797 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I were to spend lots
and lots of days around lots

00:16:09.797 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of, lots of dissonant
people, who were confused

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
or disintegrated and blaming
the world and da-da-da-da,

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:90%
then it can start to whaaa.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So I have to come back internal
and come into my own space

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and find a way to reconnect
and not be influenced so much.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But I have a regular
practice that

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.799 align:middle line:84%
keeps me pretty plugged
in, in that way.

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, your
practice of breath.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
that in just a second.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at Dr. Sue
Morter talking at the NASA TEDx

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.264 align:middle line:90%

-Stand up if you can, please.

00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Just for a moment, I'm going to
ask you to just move your body

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in a strange kind of way.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.966 align:middle line:90%
Will you do it?

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
This is about the
space to create.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:90%
No, I will not.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.925 align:middle line:90%
Yes you can.

00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Just move your body, just
not in a cool kind of way,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.956 align:middle line:84%
not in a cool-- it's hard
not to be cool, isn't it?

00:17:06.956 --> 00:17:09.399 align:middle line:84%
But just in a free kind
of way, just a little bit.

00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.426 align:middle line:90%

not quitting till you do.

00:17:16.378 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain why later.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:90%

That wasn't so bad, was it?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:90%
It was torture.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for playing.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.347 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain why later, that
I ask you to do such things.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll explain just
a little bit right now.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The electron moves outside
of its normal, predictable

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:90%
electron cloud 5% of the time.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when pure, infinite
possibility is captured.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm asking you to do
unfamiliar things every once

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
in awhile, just to move
into creative capacity.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I am not a quantum scientist.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an epigeneticist.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even a
research biologist.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But I am a doctor who's had
the great honor of working

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
with tens of thousands of
people around the world

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
over the past 25 years in the
work of removing subconscious

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
interference to
the nervous system

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and to the electromagnetic
energy system in the body.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.436 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here today to speak
to you about creativity,

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
creativity in the
sense that you are

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
more creative than you think.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you are more
creative and you can think.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.745 align:middle line:84%
There's more to you
than meets the eye.

00:18:25.745 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is more to
you than meets the mind,

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to share
these concepts with you

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:90%
in the next few moments.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
If we take all of the energy in
all of creation, that's a lot.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
If it were all present here
in this room at the same time,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
do you know what the
experience would be?

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.724 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:18:48.724 --> 00:18:50.515 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
experience, because there

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:90%
is no point of relativity.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything would be here.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We know hot, because
we know cold.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We know light
because we know dark.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.528 align:middle line:90%
We know points of relativity.

00:18:56.528 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the concept of
working with quantum science

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and how it applies in
our physical reality,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to try to
bring it down to a concept

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that we can exchange
about today.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
If we start compressing
that energy,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
compress it down and down
and down, further and further

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and further and
further, as you know,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
we eventually create
physical form.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we study
physical form, when

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
we go into the physical
matter and study it

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
at the molecular level
and the atomic level

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and the subatomic
level, eventually we

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
get to the smallest
particle known to us.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And inside that
particle, there is

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
nothing, the same
nothing that is

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
present with the
everything that is.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And what science has
determined is that there

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:90%
is no basic element to life.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
There's only form.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Energy is held together
in certain forms.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And we participate in that with
our beliefs and our thoughts.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And our creativity is
affected in that way, how we

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.116 align:middle line:90%
hold the energy in our lives.

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I ask you to do
something unfamiliar,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
it's because I'm asking you
to step outside of the box.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the box is really only
a box 95% of the time anyway.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.563 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the time,
it's pure potentiality.

00:20:09.563 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:90%

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Right.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the moment we
start thinking anything,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
we actually drop our
vibrational frequency.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The most positive thought
that you can think

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
is not as high of
an energy frequency

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
as you are emanating if you're
just being without thinking.

If you're just sitting
in appreciation,

if you're just sitting in a
blessed state or in gratitude

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
or you're actioning the
heart, an action of the heart

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is 1,000 to 10,000 times more
potent than the most positive

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:90%
thought that you can think.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So my statement in
that conference was it

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:90%
was about creativity.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what I wanted
people to understand

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is that you are made of
creative energy itself.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Anything you try to
do to be creative

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
takes you into a separate place
from your actual, true essence.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It takes you
outside of yourself.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
When you start trying
to be a good person,

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:90%
you're not being a good person.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
You're being a trier.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:90%
You're trying.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So the trying is a lower
vibrational frequency

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
than the actual just being you.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So when people
just be themselves,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
they're actually vibrating at
a higher frequency than when

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
do the right thing

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
or trying to be a
good person or trying

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to prove their value or
their worth or their--

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
if their esteem is
suffering in some way.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So the moment we start
thinking about our goodness

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
or about our success or about
our whatever the possibilities

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
are in our lives, we actually
are taking a step aside

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
from actually swimming in that
very stuff, to begin with.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We're swimming in and are
made of creative energy.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:90%
So just be that.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can't
try to be creative.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:90%
We are creative.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.937 align:middle line:84%
It's just awakening that
creativity within us.

00:22:10.937 --> 00:22:11.603 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Right.

00:22:11.603 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't not be creative.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You're made of creative energy.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:90%
So just get on with it.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Just get on with doing what
brings up joy in your life.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Just be you.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Just go do it.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you stay out of your way.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
thinking about,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
now, what would the smart
way to be creative be?

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Or how could I compare
my creativities?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And now, we're off course.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So you also talk about
the frequency of the heart

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and that the heart
frequency can actually

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
dissolve some of those
other negative frequencies

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
that we have come up in us.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Talk about the difference there.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:84%
What does the power
of the heart do?

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Heard
of mother nature?

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yeah.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:90%
So

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.305 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She's powerful.

00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Powerful thing, yeah.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So the heart vibrates
at the same frequency

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:90%
as mother nature, as Earth.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call resonance
and coherence, nature.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
The heart energy is that
energy of nature itself.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we are focused on
the heart with the mind,

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
the mind is not
going to interfere

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
with the vibrational
frequency of nature

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:84%
itself moving
straight through you.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
loving, we can even

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
overpower the dropping of
our vibrational frequency

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that the mind has been doing,
consciously or subconsciously,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
because of our worries,
because of our feelings

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of insufficiency or
inadequacy that we've

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:84%
been trapped in, that we've been
cloaked in, all of our lives.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Those illusions
have been dropping

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:90%
our vibrational frequency.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
loving, it automatically

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
starts to raise that
frequency, right up

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:84%
through those kinds of
thoughts, right up through that.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Because this is an illusion.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this heart mother
divine energy type stuff

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:90%
is the absolute.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So anything is going to
melt in its presence.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we start loving, when we
start any action of the heart--

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and it can be compassion.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:90%
It can be forgiveness.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.865 align:middle line:90%
It can be love.

00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It can even be the passion
of your own heart's desire.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Just what are you passionate
about in your life?

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:23.835 align:middle line:90%
What are you--

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
burning inside of you.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Anything, anything
that you can express, that's

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:90%
just, this is what I love.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I just love to do this.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any sense,
but I'm just going to do this.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:90%
That, my friend, is the healer.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the healer.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So any action of
the heart is going

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve the frequencies
that the mind, consciously

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
or subconsciously-- and
that's an important point.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The subconsciousness of it all
is usually what gets people.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not our conscious
mind that gets in our way.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
If we knew what the
obstacles were in our lives,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
we would get about
correcting them.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the stuff
that we don't know.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what we're
supposed to be working on.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are certainly ways
to get in touch with that.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.641 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
those subtle energy

00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that you talk
about getting-- blasting out,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yes.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.485 align:middle line:84%
They dissolve in the face of
the profound energy of nature.

00:25:11.485 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The heart presence.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.235 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yeah.

00:25:13.235 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%
The heart presence.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.163 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love this.

00:25:15.163 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Take a look here at Dr.
Sue Morter talking again

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:84%
at the TEDx NASA Conference
about the frequency

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.534 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:25:22.534 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
-Now, we as human beings have
the capacity to think thoughts.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:90%
We reject things.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
We resist things.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We create friction
for ourselves.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we throw up
a different energy frequency

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:90%
into this pattern.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.656 align:middle line:84%
In throwing up that
different energy

00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:84%
frequency, what we're doing
is drawing conclusions.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, this should
not have happened in my life.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:90%
That should not have happened.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:90%
This is right, this is wrong.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.075 align:middle line:84%
We have free will to make
these determinations,

00:25:48.075 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and in doing so, we create
a different frequency

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
that our body then
has to respond to.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is just like
sunlight coming to a plant.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Sunlight coming to a plant
allows photosynthesis to occur.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
When we receive this
high-frequency energy,

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it allows this system to vibrate
at its highest potential.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the most amazing
part of this whole picture,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
we are given an ability to meet
up with the concept of nature

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:84%
through an energy that
resides in the human heart.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The human heart is the
bioelectric powerhouse

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in the body, more
so than the brain.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.717 align:middle line:84%
It's 40 times to 60
times more powerful

00:26:28.717 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:84%
than the energies that are
emitted from the brain.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The human heart, it penetrates
every cell of the body.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And it penetrates off
of the body 8 to 10,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
at least, feet in
every direction.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So it is an energy waveform that
is generated by your ability

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to coherently
resonate with feelings

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and emotions such as love,
forgiveness, compassion,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
acceptance, embrace,
and so forth.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So when we elicit
these vibrations

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that we are capable of, and we
elicit them into this energy

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:84%
field, it has the capacity to
dissolve this interference.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The interference
occurs in this way.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:84%
If this high-frequency
energy is attempting

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to reach us at our
physical life and allow

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.789 align:middle line:84%
us to be our full
potential, and yet it

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
is hitting up against
beliefs that we

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
have put in place
somewhere along the way,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
it bounces back into
itself, and it can't get in.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.007 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like shading
between the sunlight

00:27:28.007 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and the plant.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get into
your experience.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So you are receiving
the full capacity

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
of energies that are available
to you to make the decisions

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have the capacity to
emanate in this way outwardly

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and dissolve this interference
that exists between the two.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, an energy
that is 2 and 1/2 times

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
stronger than the
energy that put this

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
here, our thoughts
of frustration,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:84%
fear, anger, and hate are
generated at 0.1 microvolts.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts, feelings of
love, forgiveness, acceptance,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
ingenuity, possibility,
these kinds

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%

from the heart space,

electromagnetic energy,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
which is 0.25 microvolts.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.597 align:middle line:84%

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that was a
great way of explaining

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
what the frequency is
and how to move beyond it

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and change the
frequency around you.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:90%
But how do you do this?

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the explanation and
that the heart can do this.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But how do you increase
the amplitude of the heart?

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Any time that we
are focusing the mind there,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:90%
we magnify it.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The heart is very
magnetic, and the mind

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is a magnifier, the mind
and the emotional body.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we are deeply
impassioned by something,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:84%
we automatically start to
activate this very energy.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
When we come out of living
on the surface of our lives,

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and we bring our
conscious attention

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.060 align:middle line:84%
to the core of our
body, we pull it in.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean like we block
things off, and we turn away.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean we just
collect ourselves.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we come into the core
and start breathing up and down

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
through the central
channel of the body,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
it, too, has a tremendous
magnifying effect on this heart

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
essence, on the capacity
for the heart vibration

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to infiltrate the whole system.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Our whole physiology
responds to this.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
practices that we

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
can do that anchor our
conscious attention deep

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.894 align:middle line:90%
into the core of our body.

00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
breathing there,

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:84%
we bring life to that
part of us that's

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
been living behind the scenes,
that is behind the personality.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's behind the ego.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It's behind all
the protective-isms

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and the idiosyncrasies
that we have

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and the false identity
of who we think we are.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to activate
this true essential self.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And when the essential
self is being activated,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:84%
it is vibrating at the same
frequency of the heart.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So your authenticity
is activating

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
of the heart resonance.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Your essential
nest is activating

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:84%
of the heart resonance,
that heart vibration.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
speaks their truth,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
even though it might cause
conflict in the temporary,

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
in the long run, it's
going to clear a path

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to be
living in the life

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that they are really
intended to be living in.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And when someone allows
themselves to be loved,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
it is automatically putting us
in that vibrational frequency.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And someone might
say, there's not

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.324 align:middle line:84%
anybody around who's actually
loving me enough to convince me

00:30:49.324 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:90%
of the fact that I am loved.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.906 align:middle line:84%
And I really want
to say to people

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't a matter
of someone loving you,

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:90%
in order for you to feel loved.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
You can feel loved any
moment that you choose.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you could just
choose to feel loved.

of unconditional love,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:90%
you focus on that.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know,
if you've never

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%

unconditional, you make it up.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:90%
How was that--

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: That's what
gets it in the body.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Movement.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: And that's a shortened
version for what I really

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:90%
like to take people through.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But it opens us, drops
us into the core,

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and then, while we're
still in that core,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to come into conscious
movement of the body,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:84%
just allowing
ourselves to be free.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It infuses it into
the cells, and that

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
activates a deep wisdom
that's inside of every cell

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're made of and allows
it to rise up and out of us.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That creates the
environment that we

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.900 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
earlier that allows

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
us to be in the presence
of our own deep I Am-ness.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:84%
That's really what we
were activating there.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you do, in
your exercise or your day,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to move and to inspire
your own energy,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and keep your energy strong?

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: I have a very
committed yoga practice.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I go to yoga classes, but I
also do my own thing, big time.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we cultivate
this breathing up and down

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
through the central channel in
this way, what starts to happen

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is we give life to
another part of us that's

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:90%
living underneath the skin.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us that's
underneath the mind.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It's underneath
the story of life.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It's this true deep
core I Am presence.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And that I Am-ness in us can
take on a life of its own

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
if we give it enough breath
and enough of our presence

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and enough of our loving
presence, I should say.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we do so, what happens
is this energy starts moving.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can start
to feel it moving.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:90%
And we can follow it.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So I do that on a regular
basis and on the yoga mat.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I get that energy
moving through my body,

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and then I allow it to just
tell me what wants to move next.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And I follow from the
inside out, and building

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:84%
neurocircuitry to allow
my brain, my mind field,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to be responding constantly to
something that is alive deep

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:90%
within the core.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a deep energetic being.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I start to
allow the neuroanatomy

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and the neurophysiology
to reframe itself

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to be self-referencing
internally, core, heart,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:84%
deep wisdom, rather than
looking to the outer world

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:90%
for my feedback.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:28.945 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:37:28.945 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you like me?

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Is this OK?

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:90%
All that is very painful.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:90%
This is very wonderful.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:90%
That can be very painful.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.734 align:middle line:90%
So that is it.

00:37:37.734 --> 00:37:39.525 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It shows up
different all the time.

00:37:39.525 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yeah,
it's relative, yeah.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do this every
morning not from a place

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.126 align:middle line:84%
of having to exercise,
from a place of--

00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:45.865 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Oh no.

00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:46.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.102 align:middle line:84%
It's like I get fussy if
I don't get to do this.

00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like, oh, god, I've
got to get up and exercise.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I can't
wait to see where

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
me next and what's

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
going to start to open
up in my system next

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and where's the energy going
to flow through me next which

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
allows me to feel my
wholeness and feel the power

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and to have it radiate
out of me in a manner

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that I can actually
sense it and feel it.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It feels like there's light
coming out of my pores

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I feel that from you.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have
stress in your body,

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is this how you get
it out of your body?

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Is this how you move it?

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Exactly, exactly.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
If I feel stress, it's because
I'm in resistance to something.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm in
resistance to something,

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:84%
it's only because there's a
part of me I don't know yet.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I knew all of me,
there would be no reason

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:84%
for me to resist
anything in life,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:84%
if I was in touch
with the wholeness

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.430 align:middle line:90%
of my being completely, 100%.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So I can go along for
long periods of time

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and be in touch with that.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
are always evolving.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We're always going to be
expanding into something new.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So something new is
going to show up,

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.885 align:middle line:84%
and our initial response to
it oftentimes is resistance.

00:38:47.885 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:90%
We want to push back.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Or hey, wait a second.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.958 align:middle line:84%
Because the subconscious
is built for survival,

00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and it tries to keep
everything the same.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Status quo means I don't
have to work too hard today

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to know that I'm safe.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we try to keep
things away from change.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:90%
But we're made of change.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Were made of changing, creative
energy, so resisting it

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:90%
is crazy.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, true.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's insane that
we try to resist that.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.923 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We do.

00:39:09.923 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Our body regenerates
constantly, so why

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:90%
would we be afraid of change?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.804 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: We want change.

00:39:15.804 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:90%
We really want change.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.320 align:middle line:90%
We just don't think we do.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If you had an
injury, and you could

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:84%
put the kibbutz on change, you
would always have an injury.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It would never heal.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.434 align:middle line:84%
Healing is because
of change, but yet we

00:39:26.434 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:90%
want to resist change.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Regeneration
is because of change.

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's
because of change.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why not just match
it and stop resisting it.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Befriend it.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.093 align:middle line:90%
Get on board with it.

00:39:33.093 --> 00:39:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Start swimming with it,
because it's happening.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to resist
that is the cause of our pain.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if I feel resistance
in my body, I go into that,

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and I squeeze it back,
to let the body know

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.630 align:middle line:90%
contact has been made.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The contact between the
body and the mind, we're in.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.147 align:middle line:90%
I'm in cooperation with you.

00:39:51.147 --> 00:39:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So then, I start breathing
through that central channel,

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and I include that
area of the body

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that I'm feeling
the resistance in.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that,
it starts to release.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that, I've
opened up to some part of me

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't open to
just a few moments ago.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more capable
of responding

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:84%
to the world that day in a
grounded, whole, full, abundant

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
way, because I'm
resisting one less

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.010 align:middle line:90%
thing out there in the world.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing, it's
an amazing opportunity.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're no
resisting it within here.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So then, anything else, you
can flow through and move.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, because
the body is holding.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:10%
It is part of the organizing
principle of natural law.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:10%
So if something in our
consciousness is not awake,

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:10%
there's a part of our body
that's suffering because of it.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:10%
If I think I'm all
alone, I'm going

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:10%
to probably have low back pain.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And if I think that I don't
get to speak my truth,

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm probably going to have
neck pain or a throat problem.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.680 align:middle line:84%
If I think that I'm
not lovable, I'm

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:84%
probably going to have
a chest issue, a heart

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:84%
pain, or mid-thoracic spine
problems, and et cetera.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of organic,
systemic diseases,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of
processes, of course, science

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
has been showing us for
years now that there's

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.100 align:middle line:90%
such a direct correlation here.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.074 align:middle line:84%
It's silly not to incorporate
this into our daily living.

00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Emotional
pain or where it

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.470 align:middle line:84%
comes to physical pain,
absolutely linked.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.636 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: It's all the same.

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've offered us a lot
of solutions and awareness

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:20.270 align:middle line:84%
really on how to
work with our bodies

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
