00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
For the majority of
people on planet Earth,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
it's our quest to find
the partner of our dreams.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Due to our complex nature,
subconscious programming,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and societal customs,
however, this eludes

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:90%
many-- if not most-- of us.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:10%
David Price Francis tells us
that there are universal laws

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:10%
governing not just our
solar system and our cosmos,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
but our personal
relationships as well.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:10%
As a 30 year student of
the ancient mysteries

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and esoteric sciences, he's
a very popular lecturer

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:10%
because he goes into the
heart of relationship--

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:10%
why they work, why they
don't, and how we can enhance

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:10%
our connection with
each other, all

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:10%
from an energy point of view.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:10%
And I have to say as I
was researching for this,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to find
out whether David's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:10%
book was available on Amazon.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I was totally shocked, I pulled
up the page on Amazon only

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to find that your book was
200-- I have it written

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:90%
down-- $291 new and $86 used.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Now thank God I
went to your site

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.911 align:middle line:84%
and found that we could also
get it for $19.95, but--

00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You know what, I don't think
I've seen very many books that

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
go for more than that on Amazon,
which only led me to understand

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:90%
people cherish this.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
they can go to your site,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
but they cherish
this information.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It is really a
functionally sublime way

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
of looking at relationships
as I go through your book,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I just have to say that.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Thank you.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I said
enough to people in the open

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
to understand a little
bit about what you do.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into--
right off the bat--

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of the masculine
and feminine energies.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:10%
OK, well John Gray popularized
the topic men are from Mars,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:10%
women are from Venus.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:10%
What isn't spoken about
is the energy reality

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:10%
behind that, that
Mars is representative

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:10%
of a red energy-- a red power.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:10%
There's a saying I grew up
with which is frogs and snails

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and puppy dog's tails--
REGINA: Yes.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:10%
 --that's what little
boys are made off.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:10%
That's what little
Martians are made

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:10%
of-- sour things, red
things, more acidic,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:10%
short-range, iron, metal iron.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
The woman, on the other hand, is
more to do with sugar and spice

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and all things nice, that's what
little Venusians are made of.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.725 align:middle line:84%
That's to do with the
color blue, copper.

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The man is the rod,
woman is the cup.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
fundamental difference

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of energetics
that both are connected to.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Up until the age of 11, that
energy connection is held

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in abeyance-- that's why we
have the term boy and girl--

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but then the moment the energies
actually start to come through,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
it's the energies
that trigger puberty.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, is that right?

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Yeah,
energies come first.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So puberty is triggered
by the energy connection,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.395 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
full-on amperage that

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:84%
goes with the
masculine power, starts

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to work through
the man's system,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and that brings chemical
and biological changes,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:90%
but it starts energetically.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:84%
In the woman's system,
again, puberty is triggered

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's a whole different
set of energies, which is then

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
symbolized in the
material worlds

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
by a different form and shape.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Those energies
are complementary.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not the opposite sex,
we're actually designed to be

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
complementary to each other.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You even refer
to it as the term

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.681 align:middle line:84%
the anodes and cathodes
of the human race.

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Yeah, yes.
-Which is very appropriate.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.397 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and so when you have
a man and a woman looking

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
at each other--
for example, we're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
looking at each other right
now-- there's a natural passage

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:90%
of ions between us.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.165 align:middle line:84%
That's why the title of the
book is "Partners in Pass-ion--"

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
or "Passion--" because
when you look up the word

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
"ion" in "Webster's Dictionary,"
it says an ion is a positively

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:90%
or negatively charged particle.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And we can, of course, have
positively and negatively

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
charged relationships.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about the
ions that are processing

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and when the anode and
the cathode come together,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
they create between
them a third field-- I

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:90%
call it the relationship field.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And inside of that field,
we plant the energies that

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
then grow in the relationships.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not by chance
it's called an energy

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
field, because we literally
plant energies in the field.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before we get into
the nature of that third,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to define
in your own way--

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
because you look at it
differently-- the word passion.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because most people would
hear this and think oh,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
this is a hot,
steamy love affair.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Passion is a much broader term
in the way you're using it.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
That passion is to do with the
hot end of the energy spectrum.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So you literally have
the idea oh, he's red hot

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
or she's red hot,
he's so hot he's cool.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the cutest thing, that's
when it goes from red to blue.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So the energy spectrum
has a hot end--

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
which is the red end-- then
it moves up to the violet end.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So with all the
colors in between--

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
this turns up in the chakra
system as the seven colors,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
but also in the
human energy field.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You're in your energy
field right now,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my energy field also,
we have a coat of many colors,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:90%
a cloak of many colors.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:90%
We're rainbow people.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have seven
different levels of energy.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of passion that
can pass between two people,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.911 align:middle line:84%
it ranges from red all
the way up to violet.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:90%
So therefore--

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.361 align:middle line:84%
And it can be
positive or negative.

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You can passionately love
someone or passionately

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
dislike them and be
repelled by them,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
but so strongly
that it's charged

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
in what you say is passion.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And it can flick
from one to the other.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Something that's a
red hot love affair

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.476 align:middle line:84%
can become a red
hot hate affair.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting the way--

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.243 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it really has to do
with charge, energetic charge.

00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's totally to
do with the charge.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And what actually draws
people together very

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.485 align:middle line:90%
often is the look in the eye.

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that the energy
fields share the first kiss,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
because it all happens
energetically first.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the audience know
the experience of walking

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
into a room and they
look around the room

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes catch one
particular person out of maybe

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:84%
100, and they know
that's the person

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to speak to.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Because something
jumps from their eyes

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to the other person's eyes
and they both feel it.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's not solid, it's
not liquid, it's not gas,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
it's energy, and it
passes through the eyes.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Partly because the eyes are the
only living tissue that we see.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are the
windows to the soul,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:84%
the eyes are also
the main transmitters

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:90%
of the ions that pass from us.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, and even beyond eyesight,
a girlfriend was telling me

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
recently-- she's newly in love--
and she said it was bizarre,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I could feel this person
behind me in the room

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
before they ever walked
around and before I saw them.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
There's an amazing story-- this
is actually my wife's father,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
this is how she came
to be in the world.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He walked into an office and
saw the back of her mother

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and knew instantly that this was
the woman he wanted to marry.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And she felt him in the
room and knew something

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:90%
had changed behind her.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly
what happens.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Without that experience,
Joanna would not have been born.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So to ignore the energetic
factor of relationships

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is to ignore what
is the relationship.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we can go into
that third entity.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and any word
that ends in "ion"--

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I always put this forward
with energy worlds--

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
any word that ends in "ion"
is to do with energies.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So we look at the word
relation, it's "relate" "ion."

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:10%
We relate to each other
energetically first.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:10%
And how strange it is when
someone has dark glasses on

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:10%
and you're trying
to engage with them,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:10%
because the dark glasses cut off
the transmission and reception.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So when two people sit
together, come together--

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
we right now are creating a
relationship field between us.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And according to what
we plant in that field,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.221 align:middle line:84%
that then causes us to have
inspiration when we meet again

00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and desperation--

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Good thing since the
show is "Inspirations."

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So according to what ions
are actually planted,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the field can become toxic.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can have that red
hot end that can go toxic

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or it can be something which
provides mutual inspiration

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and provides mutual
encouragement, mutual support.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
This is where long-term
relationships,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
they take the basic passion with
which the relationship often

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
triggers and then develop it
through passion into purpose,

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and possibly even
through purpose

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
into becoming partners
in evolution, which

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:90%
is more of a spiritual kinship.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But it begins with that first
flash or exchange of power

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and an attraction that takes
place between the two people.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it all
comes down to what

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:90%
do they actually do with that?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's timings involved,
because the first timing

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
is will it last the
28-day cycle of the moon.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:90%
Let's start about that.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here we are.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We've met someone and
it's certainly our dream

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.191 align:middle line:84%
that this person is going to
fulfill everything in our lives

00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So that first spark
of recognition,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
which can-- I
assume-- be inspired

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
by many, many different things.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so there's
that initial charge--

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and both feel it
as a charge when

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:90%
it's mutual-- there's a charge.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.381 align:middle line:84%
And the two people,
they find a way

00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to talk to each
other-- that's where

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:90%
you get past the inhibit ions.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
This is why there's alcoholic
cocktail parties and things,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.031 align:middle line:84%
it helps break down a little bit
of the inhibitions, especially

00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
in England.
-Exactly.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:84%
People then talk
with each other

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and they engage
and they discover

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:90%
if they want to re-engage.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So they go on a
first date, I call

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
it energy dating because it
starts in the energy worlds.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:90%
They go on a first date.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that date,
do they feel lifted up,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:90%
inspired, do they feel better?

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
If they feel better,
they're inclined to want

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:90%
to go on a second date.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We all know this, it's the
energy 101, kind of obvious,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's very, very significant.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end,
if both parties

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
feel like that was actually
a little bit depressing--

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
or depress ion, I didn't really
enjoy it that much-- they'll

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.843 align:middle line:90%
say should we do this again?

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
No, not really,
we'll give it a pass.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But if it lifts them both
up, they're saying oh,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
can we meet again tomorrow,
maybe on Thursday?

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And the glue that's
in a relationship

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is that third field makes
them both feel better.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.455 align:middle line:84%
So then you have this state of
the buoyancy of being in love,

00:09:56.455 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
like the energy becomes
so strong it actually

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
lifts the person
up so their energy

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
field becomes more vibrant.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
When you learn to
see energy fields,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
it changes color.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You can see, for example,
a bright yellow, which

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
is to do with the emotion,
and their energy field

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:90%
lifts them up.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So like in the song
in "My Fair Lady,"

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
it's just on the
street where you live,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but he's kind of floating
along the street.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That's that feeling of love
which lifts the person up.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:84%
If they both feel that,
then they could be pining

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
for their food, their
workmates look at them go ugh,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.454 align:middle line:84%
she must be love,
she must be in love.

00:10:28.454 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Right, you can see it.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a certain glow about
them, it's an energy charge.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And then will that
charge sustain

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.546 align:middle line:84%
over time then depends upon how
they engage with each other.

00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So why is it that
normally that charge starts

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:90%
dissipating in most cases?

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You may even choose
to make a go of it

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and make a relationship
of it, but nonetheless--

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
as by looking at
divorce statistics--

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
why do these charges
then start dissipating?

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
One thing is at the end of
the traditional fairy story,

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
it says "and then
they lived happily

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
ever after" instead
of "and then the work

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:90%
program really started."

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a work program
to actually deliberately,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
consciously develop what I call
a mutual relationship field,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and to plant in it
the things you want.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say one partner
wants something

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they feel is missing
in the relationship,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
they want extra warmth.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The first responsibility--
they've become aware of it--

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
is for them to energetically
add extra warmth--

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of waiting
for it to come to them.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Or asking for it.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Or asking for it.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
really shy to do.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
If they ask for
it in words, then

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
it's-- but when you generate.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you generate that
property, a bit more of it,

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:84%
hopefully the other
person then reciprocates.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of leading in
the relationship by example.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't ask for something
without generating a bit of it

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
yourself, because that
provides the charge to change.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
fair to tell someone

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to change without giving them
some energy to do it with.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and that's the saying.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
If you want something,
be the first to give it.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So that makes
perfect sense, you're

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
establishing an energetic
imprint or pattern.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so say you've decided yes,
I would like to explore-- you're

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
mutually in the
yellow zone floating,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and you want to explore it
further and you decide to date.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about dating
from an energy point of view.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
An example of energy
dating-- improving

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:90%
energy dating practice.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Really one of the first clues
is to be true to yourself,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
be true to your own authentic
signal that you send out.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Spend a whole lot of
time talking about this,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:90%
because this is missing.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.571 align:middle line:84%
For most people, this seems
to be missing in relationship.

00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Well if a person tries
to be what they think

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the other person wants, so
they dress up in all the latest

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
brand name stuff and
they kit themselves out

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
according to what the
street-- which really is what

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:90%
the mass media is promoting.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Because every day we're subject
to thousands of messages

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
from the mass media and causing
us to be influenced and take

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
on certain acts, take
on certain attributes,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
be a certain way, which is
not natural to our core.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So our core is like
our natural essence,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and then we adopt
things from the outside.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.865 align:middle line:84%
If we adopt ways
of going on that

00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
are not true to
our natural core,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:90%
we actually lose our signal.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We start to not be ourselves, we
start to not be like ourselves,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and this is a really key thing.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
When we start to not
be like ourselves,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
it's not far down the
road until we start

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to not like ourselves at all.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start to have
people feeling they don't feel

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.774 align:middle line:84%
like them, because their
core has been overcome by all

00:13:30.774 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:90%
the mass signals they take in.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And also perhaps by
fear-- because again, you

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:84%
have this relationship
in the beginning that

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
has this exuberance to it
and before you know it,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:90%
fear start seeping in.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is so wonderful, what
if I lose this relationship?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
distort and throw--

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I know, women in particular--
them into patterns

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
of becoming pleasers.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The man was originally attracted
to their authentic signal,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
right, and vice versa?
-Yes.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
A great example is
a radio set-- just

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
a simple, practical example--
the old-fashioned kind

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:90%
with the dial.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
the dial on station,

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
you get this
beautiful music, but

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
if the dial turns off station,
you start to get static.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So when a person starts to
produce static because they're

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
no longer true to their
own authentic self,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
then it's very hard
to pick up their song.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what gets
attracted is no longer

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:90%
what's on their frequency.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So we actually
are in a situation

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
where when we can be
true to ourselves,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:90%
we sing our own song.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
When that song goes
out into the ether,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
someone else can
actually register

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and pick up what that song
is and they come to it.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not actually
tuned into ourselves--

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like if we decide we're
going to take on the goth look,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
but that's nothing to
do with our reality

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's come upon
us from the outside.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:84%
We've just become
another goth look person,

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:90%
rather than being authentic--

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.751 align:middle line:84%
And our own signal
starts becoming obscured.

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And it could go from goth
look to "Vogue" model

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to whatever the model would be.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Or in a man's world it's going
to be whether it's following

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
NASCAR or wearing certain
sporty things from gentlemen's

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
magazines or--
whatever the thing,

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a massive influence
that comes towards the person

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and when we adopt
those signals, they can

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%
obscure our actual core signal.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens, first
we can't find our partner,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and then if we are
fortunate enough to engage,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
if we become pleasers--
so we think oh,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
what does he really
want me to be?

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
What does she really
want me to be?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know women who
are amazing women,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
powerful women in their own
right, talented, beautiful.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They go into a relationship and
the first thing that happens

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is you start losing yourself
in fear you're going to lose

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the guy, and starting to
please and become what

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:90%
you think that person wants.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.881 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned earlier,
this is epidemic.

00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the relationship
field loses its power,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
which is why the
guy in this instance

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.467 align:middle line:90%
then starts to lose interest.

00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like hey, how about
if we take a little break?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll call you next
week instead of tomorrow.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
You start noticing
the signals, and then

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
they've made popular
movies such as "He's

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Just Not That Into You."

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
That's really what's
happening, though, isn't it?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:90%
You lost your own signal.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a clear--
the anode and cathode idea--

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
when there's a clear
signal from both parties,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
you get a little
spark in the middle.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But then when one of them
changes to please the other,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like the anode tries
to change its nature

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and then the level
of spark goes down.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
interesting time-wise

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
because the first test of a
relationship is a 28-day cycle,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:90%
it's a 28-day test.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's actually finding out is
the relationship more than skin

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
deep?

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And I say it very advisedly
because every 28 days,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
we lose our skin cells.
-Yes.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Thankfully not all at once.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And the women go through
their own menstrual cycle

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:90%
every 28 days, cycles.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:90%
The moon, yeah.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.573 align:middle line:84%
So there's a moon cycle,
which is the first test

00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:90%
of a relationship.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
fascinating, it's 28 seasons.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So it goes from the moon
cycle to the planetary cycle.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.794 align:middle line:84%
28 seasons gives us
the seven year itch.

00:17:00.794 --> 00:17:01.886 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I see.
OK.

00:17:01.886 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So the seven year itch, it used
to be said how every organ gets

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:90%
changed every seven years.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.511 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, 7 years times
4 seasons, 28 seasons, OK.

00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
So then the woman looks
at the man and says,

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:90%
you're not the man I married.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's true,
because every cell's

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:84%
been changed except the
cells in the brain, the eyes.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where the eyes are
constant, and the spine.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So the brain system,
being the spine

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:90%
and the brain and the head.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And that then moves to
another cycle, which

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is a very interesting one
because I'm getting increasing

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
evidence to do with
the divorce rate

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
having a little up, certainly
in terms of stories from people

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
I talk to.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Around the 28th year mark,
which is where-- traditionally,

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
28 years would really be
the whole of the lifespan

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
of a relationship.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Go back to Victorian England
when the average age of death

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:90%
was in the 40s.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
-Kind of a normal lifespan.
-Exactly.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But 28 years now can be halfway
through the relationship.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't change
the energetic dynamic

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and the seasons and cycles.
-Correct.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And so with this Saturnian
cycle, the question then

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
comes does the relationship
have another level of purpose

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.135 align:middle line:84%
to hold the glue, to hold them
together, to move on into the

00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%
what next?

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's a symbol-- which
is really a very prime symbol

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
for the masculine,
feminine dynamic--

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's the symbol
of the fleur-de-lis.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a symbol of-- it was in the
Royal House of the Bourbons--

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the masculine
being one leaf over here,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
you've got the feminine
being the other leaf,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and then what they
power is in the middle.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The core of the fleur-de-lis
is their mutual purpose.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So I call it a mutually-agreed
purpose or map.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And when a couple
have a map and they

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:84%
have a mutually-agreed
purpose, it brings that power

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:90%
into their relationship.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Now it can be of different
levels of energy.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Two people can have a purpose,
which is to be politically

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
successful-- in the
political matrix--

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to be politically successful,
to be social clients,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to have a high level of
prestige in the world.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
That's in the lower
end of the energy bar.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But still, let's
say that that's

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
their agreed-upon
purpose, they've

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
come together for societal,
social, monetary purposes.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
What can you expect about
an authentic dynamic

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:84%
in that, either being true
to what they each desire

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
individually-- but as you
say, it's on the lower

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
part of the spectrum-- what does
that do to this third entity,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:90%
the relationship?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means what they grow
in their field between them

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
are things like mutual
support to further

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
their political
agenda, mutual support

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to further their
political career,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
referencing each other
out to other people.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So they support each
other at that level,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and that could last a lifetime.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It can, but then
you find situations--

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
when you read the headline news,
for example-- where politicians

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
often find that other
part-- that other

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.067 align:middle line:84%
spark of their life--
with other individuals.

00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
they're necessarily going

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to find that with each other.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Correct, yes.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Another example-- a more
toxic example-- is you

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
can get a couple come together
to pursue criminality or abuse.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So a good example of
that is Bonnie and Clyde.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't want to meet them.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It's great that they have the
legend of Bonnie and Clyde,

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
but they're not two people you'd
want to meet on a country road.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And especially, aren't they
then amplifying that energy

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:90%
by joining into this together?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, so what
you have is you've

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
got the Mars power--
which is that red, more

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
short-range power-- and you've
got the Venus power-- which

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is that blue, longer-range
power-- and the two of them

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.321 align:middle line:84%
are like the left and right
hand of the human team.

00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how I see it.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't get one
hand-- you go to do something

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and this hand stops it.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That's like one part
of the gender relation

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:90%
being dominant upon the other.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to you
about that in a minute.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a real
blocker to human development

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
for both parties, so
we're actually designed

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.147 align:middle line:90%
so we're complementary.

00:20:51.147 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We're different
energies, but they're

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.574 align:middle line:84%
complementary to each other
moving in a third direction.

00:20:54.574 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what that
fleur-de-lis symbol--

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
But each one has to
be authentic and true

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to their own signal.
DAVID: Yes.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Their own truth, their own
desires, their own destiny.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The problem is if we even have
the clarity within to know

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
those things, because
again, individually we're

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
being pressured from outside
stimuli and demands that make

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
it very hard to hear our own
signal and thus project it,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know what we are.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what we want,
we don't know what we think,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
we're too busy trying
to please everybody.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if you
have a relationship

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
based on social
obligation, then that's

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
the level it gets caught at.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And when two people actually
are both authentic--

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
let's say we're right now in
the "Inspirations" program

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's about increasing
global consciousness--

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
there's consciousness
in the relationship.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So when two people come
together and they both

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
share the authentic
purpose of wanting

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to raise their level
of consciousness,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
they can help each other do
that and they can get to levels

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that they would not be
able to on their own

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:84%
because they actually
bring the forces together,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's where one
and one becomes three.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
What if you're a
woman sitting there?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we're talking
about the same thing--

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have
the same polarity--

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're a woman
telling me the same thing.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Would this information not be
enhanced to the same degree,

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe not heard or
received to the same degree?

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the same information--
it would be the same energy,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the same potency-- so in that
respect, yes it should be heard

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and listened to, to the
same degree, absolutely.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering if there's
an intrinsic dynamic to being

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
able to experience or take
in something as a result

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.950 align:middle line:90%
of this anode-cathode.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, there certainly
is in the way

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that the woman holds the--
it's in the book-- is

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the woman has 2/3
feminine power,

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.731 align:middle line:84%
but at the core
is 1/3 masculine.

00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And the man--
-Yes, that was fascinating.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
 --2/3 masculine, and at
the core is 1/3 feminine.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what was meant
by the yin-yang symbol,

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:90%
it's what it symbolizes.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So the man is always trying to
complete himself by connecting

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
with that energy in the
woman, and the woman

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
seeks to complete
herself by connecting

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to that energy in the man, and
so they spin around each other.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that, because
when you start dating-- when

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I was reading that in your book,
I thought that was fascinating.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So you meet someone, this person
has elevated your awareness

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and your energies-- you're
actually not seeking

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
their feminine then,
you're saying-- if you're

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
a man-- you're seeking the
higher masculine portion

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:90%
of the woman's field.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're seeking
to complete yourself

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
by engaging in that
complementary relationship.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher
part of the Mars

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%
force is held in the woman.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Interesting example, take
Margaret Thatcher in Britain,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:90%
she was call the Iron Lady.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Iron is to do with Mars.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Copper-- it's
intersting, copper's

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:90%
on the beat in Britain.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Copper is more to do with
blue-- regulation blue,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
regulating blue,
more long-range.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So a natural way of
development, a good example

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
is-- I'm jumping a little
bit-- but the Iroquois League,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
they actually had a system
where the men would get together

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:90%
and they'd have a red council.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go grr, we're going
to go and fight the Seneca.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But before they would,
they would actually

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
go and check in with
the clan mothers-- who

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
were the blue
council-- and the clan

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
mothers would then
assess whether that

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:90%
was wise for the long term.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Because men tend to
be tunnel vision,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:90%
men like to make pointy things.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:90%
They tend to go for the point.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And even physically,
peripheral vision in a woman

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:90%
is greater than in the man.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So the man is much more
pointed towards a target.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you say that
red energy is a more short

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:90%
fuse, a short-term energy.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: So it's got a
short range frequency.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The blue has got the
long-range frequency,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
so it was the women who would
have the final decision.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So if the women,
if the clan mothers

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
said no, you're not going
to go and fight the Seneca,

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
they would not go.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because they wouldn't
defy the clan mothers.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So in our world
government today,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:84%
we're so messed up because the
men have got so much control.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, if I was in charge
of the United Nations--

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
if that were to
be-- I would look

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
for an energetic equality--
50% men, 50% women.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Not in terms of
academic qualifications,

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:84%
intellectual qualifications,
all that stuff,

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
but there'd be a
balance of the energies.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as
the women's energy is

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
not there in a strong
enough way, the men

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:90%
are short-term thinkers--

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
we have today.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Military-industrial
complex, picking

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
one more after another for a
quick profit and exploitation.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
That would be very
male, wouldn't it?

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: That would be
very red, very acidic.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also very interesting
in terms of the word acid.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a time where the
world is becoming acidic,

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
but the planet is naturally
more alkaline blue.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So the planet is more
feminine, so we call the planet

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:90%
the Great Mother, our mother.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the masculine
influence needs

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to be restrained and
subject to the cooling

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:90%
influence of the feminine.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Which is interesting--

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: The masculine's
run away with itself.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming forward
more, where more women are doing

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
their role, providing
a role such as what

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm providing right now.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And the men who are more
open and really evolved

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in their thinking are
not fighting this,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
but welcoming this in,
because they inherently

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
seem to understand, there is a
deep healing within themselves

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:90%
in that sense.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to that
and talk about what happens

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
in entire societies when you
start repressing the feminine,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and then also what
happens even in dream time

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
as we sleep alongside
one another.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.532 align:middle line:90%
So we'll be right back.

00:26:35.532 --> 00:26:38.948 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:90%
All right, we're back.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at
what happens when you take

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:84%
an entire culture where the
women have been subjugated

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to whatever the male agenda
is-- and some of them going on

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years--
and why that country really

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
can't progress.
-Yes.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, what happens-- as in an
individual relationship-- when

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:10%
the red power
subjugates the blue,

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:10%
then the blue is not able
to provide the cooling,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:10%
the nurturing, the nourishing
in the way that it can

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:10%
when it's able to fully
express itself and be itself.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:10%
So the men actually cut
off their own fuel supply,

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.265 align:middle line:10%
the men actually cut
off the power they

00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:10%
need for their development.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:10%
So those countries get
caught in a backward spiral,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and they also
become very red hot.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:10%
So they get to be more
masculine-dominated.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
When you get something
that's red hot,

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:84%
it puts out a lot of
friction and a lot of heat,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and that then leads to
tribal conflict, warfare.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very bad--

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like what we were
talking about before the break.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.221 align:middle line:84%
But this just goes on and on,
it really can't heal itself,

00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
can it?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
As long as the women are
suppressed, it cannot.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So part of the key
to this new time

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is the fact of--
the new age which

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
we hear so much
about-- is that there's

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
a rising feminine power.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a blue wave coming and
the red wall is going down.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's now,
whether it's in 10 years,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in 20 years, we're
not going to see situations

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
like we see in North
Korea where you get

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
all the men along the table
and the women are coming

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
behind carrying cups of tea.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.269 align:middle line:84%
It's over.
-Right.

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But the men-- that's
not to say all men--

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:84%
but that red masculine
history, the patriarchy,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to let go easy.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So the old ways are holding
on as long as they can-- so

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal
societies, patriarchal

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
views-- the old ways that
resist the new wave are

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:90%
still pushing back.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I'm concerned-- we
can see it very strong in North

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
America-- it's the
women who are leading

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the way in terms of that quest
into spiritual consciousness.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
When I go to events
deliberately-- just

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to see who's
there and to count--

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and I go to new
consciousness events,

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
usually it's eight women to
two men, nine women to one man.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
ratio I'm seeing,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because the women's
instinct is more

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
turned in to what's changing.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and that takes
women into a new area.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed something
that's kind of interesting--

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and partially I think it has to
do with women who are over 40

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
or 50 or 60 as well--
but there is a parting

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
of ways with a lot
of women I know

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and their men, in that the men
want to keep the relationship

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
going as it is and the
women want to unplug

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes, they don't
want to have intimate relations

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:90%
with the men anymore.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing this a lot,
I'm hearing this a lot now.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So what's taking place
is the women naturally

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:90%
want to spiritually evolve.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a power
coming to the planet--

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
this is where the bigger
picture of the energy worlds.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:90%
These times are changing times.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the last 30 years
and the amount of energy work

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
which is now taking place, I
was teaching people 35 years ago

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:84%
how to see the energy
worlds, how to feel them,

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
how to work with them, and it
was very strange to people.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Now they're into
Reiki and Qi Gong

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and therapeutic touch--
energy healing of all kinds--

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.570 align:middle line:84%
because the amount
of energy that's

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:84%
coming through the planet
is increasing very quickly.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the shift
into the Age of Aquarius,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
because Aquarius is
not a water carrier

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but is actually the
carrier of energy or power.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a major
surge of power going on,

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and the women are
picking up on it first

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
with their good, blue,
long-range instinct.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
The men are more hanging into
the old ways, the old red ways.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So the natural state--
which is really

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
what I think we want to be
focusing on in the long term--

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
is that the red and the blue
have a true state of energy

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.765 align:middle line:84%
quality, essence quality,
equality, that they're

00:30:38.765 --> 00:30:39.565 align:middle line:90%
actually in partnership.

00:30:39.565 --> 00:30:42.521 align:middle line:84%
And between them, they
produce a third state--

00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
 --which in Japan they
call it Wa, harmony.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The red and the blue--
the Venus and the Mars--

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
produce a third state which--
just like on the pH strips

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
for litmus-- if it's too
alkaline it goes blue,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:90%
if it's two acid it goes red.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a nice balance,
you get white in the middle.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
for is that harmony state,

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's why when there's
a balanced relationship

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in a house, then
there's an energy

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
which can be felt in its healing
and it's nice to be there.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what a
lot of houses feel like.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And even though you
have relationships that

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.833 align:middle line:84%
are considered from
the outside oh,

00:31:17.833 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:84%
they're a good, solid
couple, they've been together

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.661 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years, the kids are
in college now, it's good,

00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:90%
it's good.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Yet you see this withering
inside of individuals,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and then it gets
us to the subject

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
of infidelity versus monogamy.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Where as you write in the
very beginning of your book,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you have an
encounter with someone

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's this incredible
electricity flying

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
between the two
of you but you're

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
in a committed
relationship or they're

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:90%
in a committed relationship.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And now you're getting into
bumping up against something

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that appears to have
some authenticity in it,

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
bumping up against the societal
standards, cultural standards.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And also probably--

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:90%
What does that do to a person?

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's also bumping up
against pre-made commitments

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:90%
and contracts.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it comes
to a very important part

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of the authenticity, I call
it being your own boss, which

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is the-- and the original
meaning of the word boss

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the boss is
the center of a wheel.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's been changed
over the years

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to bosses, offices,
and all that,

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:84%
but the origin is to do
with the hub of the wheel,

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:90%
the center of the wheel.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So when a person is
authentic in themselves

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and they make commitments from
the center of their wheel,

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
then they keep the integrity
of those commitments.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.490 align:middle line:84%
If they're so attracted
to another person,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:84%
their integrity will cause them
to go to their existing partner

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and say, I've got this
incredible attraction

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to this person over here and
I want to break this contract.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
comes down on that,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going
off and undercover

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.110 align:middle line:84%
having an affair
on the side which

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:90%
they're not talking about.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Right, because energetically
what happens when they're not?

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Most people are not upfront.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the number of affairs
percentage-wise is significant.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say they go the
other way and they think gosh,

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I have this thing, I owe it
to myself to give it a try,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:90%
and then they sneak around.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is
that the energy that's

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
in the core relationship--
it's meant to be, it's

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.890 align:middle line:84%
like by design-- depends
on the relationship

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that people set up
in the first place.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But if they're trying to
deal from boss to boss,

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.740 align:middle line:90%
from one core to the other--

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Two whole beings to the other--

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Endeavoring to make
that kind of contract.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they gradually
lose that connection,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
so they find themselves moving
in a different direction.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The power that was
there between them

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
no longer goes into
that third field,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
so the other partner starts
to feel like what's wrong?

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Something's the matter, I've
just got this feeling that he

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:84%
doesn't send me flowers
anymore, we don't laugh together

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:90%
anymore, something's changed.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The classic example used to be
when there's the new secretary

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.290 align:middle line:84%
at the office or
whatever, and they're

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
not actually having an
affair but the energy

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
is leaving the system.
REGINA: Right.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing when
speaking about cyber sex.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So the energy still
leaves the system,

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:84%
even though there isn't
anything actually physically,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.380 align:middle line:90%
materially happening.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
In the energy worlds,
it's still rupturing,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
so the energies are leaving.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to a
long-term relationship

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and seeking to build a
long-term relationship,

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
it's actually deliberately
planting the qualities

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:90%
you want in the field.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Because then there's a
comparison that's like,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
there's this very
powerful attraction here

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
but there's 20 years
building something

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:90%
that can't be replicated.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.014 align:middle line:84%
You don't get 20 years
to do that again.

00:34:41.014 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:90%
So what's in the balance is--

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And we can see those, too.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I was
asking about before is

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
the nature of deceit,
which goes against-- I

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:84%
mean, our fields know the truth
even if our brain doesn't, even

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:90%
if we're in denial.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Some aspect of our being--
because we're connected

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
with each other--
knows the truth,

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and so what happens when you
go into deceptive business

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:90%
with say, a third partner?

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
asking, does that

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:90%
affect on the energy field?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because that produces--
in the energy worlds--

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a low
green frequency.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like they say you
go green with envy,

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
it's to do with a
certain frequency

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and it comes into the field.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like the field
between the two people

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:84%
gets invaded by
an energy blight,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
so when one can see these
things energy worlds first,

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.720 align:middle line:84%
then the process of building
and nurturing that field

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:90%
is a very deliberate process.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So one wouldn't just
turn away after 20 years

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and walk away from it
because it's too precious.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But if it has not been well
cared for-- if it's not been

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:84%
well tended, if there
hasn't been work

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
go into the relationship--
then the valencies--

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:84%
like in chemistry-- the
valency that holds the couple

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:90%
together gets to be very weak.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And divorce is two words
in one, division of forces.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So the forces divide because
there's more attraction,

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, in the
woman to someone

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:84%
who's just entered
over here, but

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:90%
there's a powerful green flash.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening
with the other man

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:84%
has got rather old and
tired and doesn't actually

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:84%
have the passion
anymore or the purpose.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Purpose can replace passion.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that now,
how we feed that field you're

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about so
that we can have more

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of a long-term shot at
it through a purpose that

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:90%
is agreed upon.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's start really close
to home for the watchers,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:84%
which is that in the house where
you live, what is in the house?

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
How does it come
to be in the house?

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's in the
house reflects the energies

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
that partnership has
brought together.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's single, it
shows the energies they've

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:90%
surrounded themselves with.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.180 align:middle line:84%
If they're in a relationship
and they're both living in that

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
place, every single
item in the house

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is a little mini radio
set, it's a token,

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
it's a talisman that
connects to an energy.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So are the energies
fresh and moving forward?

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Is the furniture in the same
position it was 10 years ago?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Are the things on the wall the
same as they were 10 years ago?

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Have you dusted lately?

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: If so, it's likely
the energies have got stuck.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
If the relationship is fresh,
things get moved around,

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
things change,
there's new projects.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And when there's new projects,
there's actually new energies

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:90%
coming to the relationship.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So when two people get
fed up with each other--

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
which is what often
precedes divorce--

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.210 align:middle line:90%
it's like these two mugs.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- if you imagine
this is the man and the woman--

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and they get locked
into each other.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So what you then have
is they're static

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and-- this is one of the things
that happens and often brings

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:84%
an early divorce-- is
they try and complete

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.140 align:middle line:90%
their life with each other.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You see this very often
with young couples,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
they're clasping each
other like if only

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
they could just bring
the other person

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:90%
entirely inside themselves.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But the laws of the
universe don't allow it,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
so they have to
build a relationship

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
way it's been set up,

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:84%
it's the way it's
established here.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So with these two, if they
stay in the same place

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and they just stay
doing the same things,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.430 align:middle line:84%
after about seven years they
get fed up with each other.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
If, however, you can imagine
that there's a third power--

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:84%
we'll use this as an example--
and this is their purpose

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and it pulls them,
then you actually

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:90%
have the whole thing moving.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're never
in the same energy,

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:84%
from one day to the next.
-Yes.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship has
fresh energies coming into it,

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and so it's like a wise
man once said to me,

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
a minute-by-minute love
affair lasts forever.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful idea
because the energies are

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.630 align:middle line:90%
fresh that's coming through.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.445 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's like--
take the example with Joanna

00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and myself-- we've
been working together--

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:84%
not just married together, but
building a business together--

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:90%
for 34 years.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's like a
double marriage because

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.310 align:middle line:90%
of all the energy and time.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we were just
looking at each other

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.005 align:middle line:84%
to complete each other, we would
have parted a long time ago.

00:39:04.005 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And our own contract
is we'll stay together

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
as long as it works,
which means we

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:90%
have the freedom to walk away.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though we've been together
34 years, we're not locked

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and that means that
we're able to make

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:90%
it work from day-to-day.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be a process
of creation every single day.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.230 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And you create ions, which
is creating new energies.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see
it my entire life,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I've always seen relationships
that-- symbolically,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
looking at it-- that work
or where the two people seem

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to be facing forward together,
facing the same direction,

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and either walking very close
to each other or holding hands.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's that outward
participation and engagement

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:84%
with life that keeps
them propelling forward,

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:84%
versus a stagnancy
of looking at,

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.330 align:middle line:84%
peeking at, trying to control,
staring at each other.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:84%
That just seems like
a death warrant.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.733 align:middle line:84%
And they even show this in
postures in Egypt, which

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is something that I teach in
my workshops, which is where

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
they had certain postures
to boost the energy

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.380 align:middle line:90%
field between people.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
certain postures that

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.300 align:middle line:84%
literally would boost the
soul of the man and the woman.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't show one here
now, but one of the postures

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.180 align:middle line:84%
will be standing
and the man places

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
his right hand at the
base of the woman's spine,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:90%
but not quite touching.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The right hand, so right
behind the base of the spine--

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
-At the sacrum.
-At the sacrum.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And the woman
holds her left hand

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.710 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the man's spine,
and then they have their feet

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:90%
in a particular position.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they're looking--
just as you said--

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking
at each other,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.795 align:middle line:84%
they're both looking
long distance.

00:40:39.795 --> 00:40:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:90%
In the same direction?

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In the same direction, so
they're looking long distance

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:90%
in the same direction.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You see the same thing
in the royal courts.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We can show this one, which
is if I had my hand here,

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
yours would go just on
top at about an inch away,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and then if we were
in a procession--

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:90%
a state procession--

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Feel energy.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's startling.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We'd both be looking
that way and we

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.580 align:middle line:84%
would literally walk in a
procession, and that would be--

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Like the stately court dances
you're speaking about, yes.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We've seen examples
of this, yes,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:84%
where they're not
actually touching.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought it was
a puritanical thing, like oh,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:90%
they didn't touch back then.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:90%
No, this was for purpose.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
The idea of not
touching was to build

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:84%
the power, because
when you touch,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.290 align:middle line:90%
you actually ground the energy.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:90%
You ground it down.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So they would
deliberately not touch,

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.451 align:middle line:84%
so I actually teach
court dancing.

00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.684 align:middle line:84%
I was doing this a while
ago with a whole gathering--

00:41:31.684 --> 00:41:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I heard from some
people that went

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to your court dancing class,
they said it was amazing.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And what we were doing was
literally using these postures

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to build the soul power
between the men and the women,

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and the amazing thing is
it lifts above personality.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is in the court dances,

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:84%
there's an engagement
with the eyes.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And you look into the
other person's eyes

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's like looking into the
soul force of the other half

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:90%
of the universe, in a way.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like the masculine
represents one power

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the feminine
represents a different power

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So when they look at each
other without the trappings

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and just really-- almost
like a naked look-- then

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.710 align:middle line:84%
the two powers can look at
each other through human eyes.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:18.110 align:middle line:84%
That's very frightening for
the majority of the population.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is why it works
in a court dance,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:90%
because it has a framework.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It has a framework.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.325 align:middle line:90%
That's very-- yes.

00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So it gives permission.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about something

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:90%
that happened yesterday.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So we met before, we met for
a little business meeting

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
last night so I
could get to know

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
some of the other
information not in the book.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we were walking along,
what was so interesting

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:84%
is you were telling me
about-- and I had already

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:84%
read-- that if the man has the
woman on his right-hand side--

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and so it would be the man's
right hand and the woman's

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.280 align:middle line:90%
left hand like this.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But even if you're
not holding hands--

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.140 align:middle line:84%
you can be holding hands or
you can just be walking down

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the street-- this side creates a
positive field between the two.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So David had told me this, so
we're walking along together.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:84%
We tried it out and
we're walking along,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and what happened is
when I was on this side

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I noticed-- as we were just
talking-- our bodies were

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.140 align:middle line:84%
automatically just
gravitating toward each other

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:84%
until I bumped into him,
shoulder-to-shoulder.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Then one of us did a switcharoo
around to the other side,

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to try the other side, and
it was almost a-- you're not

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.265 align:middle line:84%
repulsive, I'm not
saying that-- but there

00:43:24.265 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:90%
was a repulsing type of energy.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt suddenly much
cooler, more distant,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and was wedging away from you.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Which I found
absolutely fascinating,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:84%
people need to try this.
-Absolutely.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And they do it already
instinctively because I'm

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:84%
sure that everybody watching
us had the experience,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
they're walking along beside
somebody and for some reason

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:84%
they feel like they're
on the wrong side,

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and they switch sides
but they don't know why.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But they just feel an
instinct to switch sides.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is balancing
the energy flow-- they're

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.910 align:middle line:84%
making it stronger,
they're making it weaker,

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:84%
whatever the case is-- and their
instinct is doing it for them.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reverse
polarities of male-female,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.980 align:middle line:90%
it's very simple, energetic.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, in Egypt
they show postures that

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.960 align:middle line:90%
demonstrate the polarities.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So they show that the man's
hand has a positive transmitting

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.730 align:middle line:84%
polarity, and the
woman's left hand has

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:84%
a positive
transmitting polarity,

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and it crisscrosses throughout
the whole body, which

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
is demonstrated with
diagrams in the book.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we're actually positive
to positive, we boost the flow.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
When we go negative to
negative, we calm it down.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that, you
can use it deliberately.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And here I think is a really
important thing because I

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.350 align:middle line:84%
taught this many
years ago, but it

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:90%
wasn't as potent as it is now.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So what's coming is with the
new energies that are coming in,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:84%
these fields and the phenomena
that we have with these fields

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.480 align:middle line:90%
are getting stronger.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why your audience may
start now to feel and register

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.640 align:middle line:84%
these things in a
way they couldn't

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.270 align:middle line:84%
before, because the energies
are getting much more potent.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would prophecize--
make a prophecy

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:84%
on air-- that in 10 years,
they'll be more potent still.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that makes total
sense with what's going on.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you're
a man and a man then,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to develop
rapport in a relationship--

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.770 align:middle line:84%
or friendship or
business or whatnot--

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
this natural affinity?

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
How do men then
tend to positively

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:90%
approach each other and bond?

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.490 align:middle line:84%
One interesting thing
is men being all red,

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:90%
men tend to do things together.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Men don't tend to be so
happy being together,

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.540 align:middle line:84%
they don't tend to find
them just hanging out.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They're not
sipping lattes all day.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.840 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: No, they tend to
be wanting to billiards,

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.310 align:middle line:90%
NASCAR, do this, do that.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.675 align:middle line:84%
There was a poet,
Robert Graves, he

00:45:36.675 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:84%
wrote a beautiful poetry book
called "Man Does, Woman Is."

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So the woman contains
more of the being.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, for women to
get together and talk and chat

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and hang out, they don't need
to be so much doing something,

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.590 align:middle line:90%
it's enough to be.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But for men, they need to
more be in the doing vector.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's how men tend to bond.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.400 align:middle line:90%
That certainly makes sense.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk
about what happens

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.130 align:middle line:84%
when we're not
consciously making

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:90%
decisions because we're asleep.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Say we're sleeping in the
same bed and the dynamics

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:84%
of sleeping on say, this side
where your positive sides are

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
meeting versus the
other way, and moving

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.180 align:middle line:84%
around during the night
and dreaming together

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a lot
to the dream time.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and sleep is
such a crucial dynamic.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the main time when
we charge our souls--

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.840 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, we
don't charge our souls,

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:90%
we go unconscious.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Not ourselves, our souls,
just in case anyone's

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:90%
not hearing that.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And we don't charge our
souls, we go horizontal

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and we plug into the
planet's energy grid,

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and she charges us.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And with training you can learn
to see this because we have

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the aura, but also the etheric,
which is the close in-band

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.310 align:middle line:90%
around the head.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And when someone's going to
sleep, it gets very thin.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why we say sleep
tight before someone sleeps.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, the whole
system's got re-charged,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:84%
it's expanded, and
you look at someone

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.900 align:middle line:90%
and say oh, you're wide awake.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So it goes through a
process of charging

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.550 align:middle line:90%
through the hours of the night.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So how you sleep-- the position
you sleep in-- is important.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're sleeping
directly with somebody,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.320 align:middle line:84%
then there's an
exchange of energies

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:90%
going on all through the night.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is also how men and
women come to be a bit more

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.890 align:middle line:84%
like each other or even
look like each other

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:84%
over years, because
if they're sleeping

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.430 align:middle line:84%
together and exchanging
energies all night love as well,

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.290 align:middle line:84%
it puts them on
the same frequency.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It also means,
though, that they can

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:29.890 align:middle line:84%
even have each other's dreams.
REGINA: Yes.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Because dreams--

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Or be in
a dream together.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.900 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Or be in
a dream together.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Dreams are caused
by energetics, this

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:84%
is why the Native Americans
have those dream catchers.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.140 align:middle line:84%
They were not actually to
catch dreams, what the dream

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.870 align:middle line:84%
catcher was for was
to catch the lower

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:90%
energies which create dreams.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you get low
energies in a person's mind,

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.300 align:middle line:90%
they create bad dreams.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So if, let's say, the man's
had a really rough day

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and the woman's had an inspiring
day and they go and sleep

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:84%
together, some of the woman's
inspiration passes to the man

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and he feels better.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of the man's rough
day passes to the woman

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and she feels not-so-better,
so they equalize out.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.830 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's a valid
question to question

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.060 align:middle line:90%
sleeping arrangements.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, now that's another
thing I've noticed.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.640 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more
and more common

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.860 align:middle line:84%
for people to say you know,
I really feel like I want

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:90%
to have my own sleeping space.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm
noticing gender-wise

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be more of the
women saying this than the men.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be
that the men draw

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:30.690 align:middle line:84%
more of the charge from the
women than the other way

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.161 align:middle line:84%
around.
REGINA: At night?

00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:84%
At night--
REGINA: The men are--

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.720 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: The men are
drawing power because part

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of the way the system's
designed is that the power rises

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
from the planet, it
comes into the women,

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.300 align:middle line:90%
the women pass it to the men.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the women actually
provide the power

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to the men, that's why if
the men suppress the women,

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
they lose power and they
start to become lesser as men.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
you decide all right,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sleep in
my little space or even

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
my own little room, and you can
sleep in yours-- what happens

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to the men then when they
don't have the advantage

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:90%
of the draw from the woman?

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, or single men.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.290 align:middle line:90%
How do they charge?

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on the man.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They can get grumpy, they can
go and find somebody else.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.700 align:middle line:84%
They can also be in
their own process

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and find that when they actually
get together with their partner

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that the strength of
energy between them

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is so much more enhanced
in their waking hours

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that it's well worth
sleeping separately,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.851 align:middle line:84%
because they're able to get
closer to their authentic self.

00:49:28.851 --> 00:49:29.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:30.983 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
mushing their energies

00:49:30.983 --> 00:49:32.060 align:middle line:90%
together all night long.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.113 align:middle line:84%
That's why, again, in
times gone by there'd

00:49:34.113 --> 00:49:36.000 align:middle line:84%
be the king's chamber
and the queen's chamber.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:84%
They'd have two rooms so
their energies could build.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
actually get together,

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the energies have a
lot more spark rather

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:90%
than running it all into one.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like you've
got on the wedding

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:90%
cake, the black and the white.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The black figure for the man,
the white figure for the woman,

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
they're showing to be
two different polarities.

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:59.670 align:middle line:84%
What can happen over 10 years is
they both go gray because they

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:90%
mush up the energies.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So actually, it can
improve a relationship

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.250 align:middle line:90%
to sometimes sleep apart.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people that have
made that decision say that.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.090 align:middle line:84%
That they're more refreshed for
one, and yes, that whole notion

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that you have your own energy
field around you at night

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.250 align:middle line:90%
without any disturbance.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense, logically.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And to come back to
being one's own boss--

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to think it through
with your partner

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.955 align:middle line:84%
without the stereotypes
that come in,

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:27.295 align:middle line:84%
and without the mattress
companies playing a part,

00:50:27.295 --> 00:50:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and without everybody
else who's saying oh,

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.220 align:middle line:90%
that's what men and women do.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Once you're married,
you sleep together

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.240 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your life.
-Or what's wrong with you?

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Hey, did you hear they
have separate beds now?

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a stigma
attached to that still.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Which is where when
you have your own mind--

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.405 align:middle line:84%
your own decision-making process
between the two partners--

00:50:46.405 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what the
rest of the street thinks.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's a strong
power of convention.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Convention, again, lives
in the lower energy world.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.810 align:middle line:84%
The higher we go in
terms of a partnership,

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.580 align:middle line:84%
the more spiritual a partnership
becomes, the brighter

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:90%
the energies in the house.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.110 align:middle line:84%
To the point where
they can actually

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.730 align:middle line:84%
be a glow around both
partners, and they

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.230 align:middle line:84%
actually anchor and produce a
healing energy in the house.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Which to me, the difference
between a house and a home

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is the energies that
are generated in it.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So the energies that are
generated into the house

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.310 align:middle line:90%
create the feeling of the home.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.990 align:middle line:84%
If what's produced
are toxic energies,

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:25.110 align:middle line:84%
then you actually get a toxic
atmosphere in the house.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And someone walking
into it is like, ooh--

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.080 align:middle line:84%
if they're sensitive-- they
go ooh, I don't like this,

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I want out.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.330 align:middle line:84%
If they're actually both,
let's say, altruistic

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually
into the healing arts,

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.360 align:middle line:84%
then what can happen
is you can get

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.270 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful yellow and green
atmosphere in the house,

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and people are
attracted to come around

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
because they feel better.
REGINA: Right.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And so relationships can
lift us up, can bring us down,

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing that helps--
I believe-- human development

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.110 align:middle line:84%
faster than being in
a right relationship,

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing that
blocks it more thoroughly

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.220 align:middle line:84%
than being in a relationship
that's not working.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that because we

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:84%
get into the subject of
destiny, and each one of us

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:90%
is born with our own destiny.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in a relationship,

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though oftentimes
one person's destiny--

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.470 align:middle line:84%
if not both-- are
completely squashed

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and left by the wayside for the
compromises that happen to come

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.640 align:middle line:84%
together, raise a family,
make the right amount

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.020 align:middle line:90%
of money, and so forth.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we lived in a
spiritually-based society--

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:28.850 align:middle line:84%
which is where I love the
idea of a global consciousness

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.550 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in a
spiritually-based society,

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:84%
our focus would be on
spiritual development

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and how we can improve
as human beings.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Relationships would
be part of the support

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:90%
system towards that.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- I believe it
once was in very early Egypt--

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:84%
there's been certain
times in world history

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:50.201 align:middle line:84%
where there's been successful,
spiritual societies.

00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you walk down the
street, instead of seeing

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:84%
a big placard advertising a car,
it would say something like,

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:84%
have you been kind to
your partner today?

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.049 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:58.049 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Or it would
say something like,

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:84%
remember your next
thought counts

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:90%
towards your reincarnation.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead of advertisements
for whatever it might be

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that's coming at you.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Buy Coke.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever it may
be because right now,

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.440 align:middle line:84%
there's tens of millions
of human hours going

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.810 align:middle line:84%
into this very day, how to
influence us in the direction

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of being persuaded to
buy products, which

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.290 align:middle line:90%
are feeding a profit motive.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is not helping
towards our spiritual purpose

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.790 align:middle line:90%
or progress or development.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So because the
tide of our culture

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.580 align:middle line:84%
works against
spiritual development,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.310 align:middle line:84%
it takes brave people
to actually say,

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going the other direction.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really state
your own desire and purpose

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:45.610 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship right up
front, and this-- ideally,

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:50.710 align:middle line:84%
if you have a spiritual
overarching component

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to it-- the relationship,
you're saying,

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:84%
should be constructed to serve
your spiritual development.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:57.230 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Yes.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Individually, which will create
this beautiful third entity.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then both
partner's destiny is

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.930 align:middle line:84%
enhanced-- which
doesn't mean they're

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:90%
going to the same place.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like the idea that
oh, when you go to heaven,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you're with the person you've
been with for 40 years.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.680 align:middle line:84%
You might not want
to by that point.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But also, simply the fact
that you've helped each other

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:20.840 align:middle line:90%
through this planetary journey.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So this journey is a
70, 80, 90-year journey.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.500 align:middle line:90%
It's short.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing thing
with human beings,

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.554 align:middle line:84%
we don't know
where we came from,

00:54:28.554 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:84%
we don't know where
we're going to,

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but we're meant to
know what we're doing.

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're asleep, one-third
of our lives are unconscious,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and we see the world through
two little holes in the front

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of our face, but we're
meant to be able to have

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the perfect relationship.
-Yes.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:43.894 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: And it's a challenge.

00:54:43.894 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It is a challenge.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a real challenge.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So sharing is part of how
we can help each other,

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.570 align:middle line:84%
but when one partner
dominates the other--

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.600 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Not possible.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And when one is spending
themselves trying to please

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.300 align:middle line:90%
the other, still not possible.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Either way.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- we only have
a few minutes left, I mean,

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.730 align:middle line:84%
the time has flown--
but one thing

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that you write about is
the three tests of time

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
strengthen a relationship

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.340 align:middle line:90%
over the three tests of time.

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.330 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, first is the 28 days.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.600 align:middle line:90%
So that was the moon's cycle.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's a flash that
you think oh, he looks good,

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:16.650 align:middle line:90%
she looks good.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:18.340 align:middle line:84%
You kick each
other's tires and you

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:84%
go no, the advertising
looked good

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.771 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
really quite work.

00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Skin deep.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:24.636 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: By this
time you're usually

00:55:24.636 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:84%
going into some kind of
fear and in-authenticity

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:90%
which will blow it apart anyway.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Right, so it's
over after 28 days.

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Second level is that seven
year itch, 28 seasons.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's a full cycle of
the planet, and by that point

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:84%
there'd better be something
beyond the original passion

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.830 align:middle line:90%
to sustain the relationship.

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:47.060 align:middle line:90%
So now you need purpose.

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And so what's the third one?

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So everything hinges on what's
been done with the passion, so

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.565 align:middle line:84%
the third one is then the
mutually-agreed purpose

00:55:54.565 --> 00:55:55.520 align:middle line:90%
or the map.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The third one is the 28
year, Saturnian time cycle.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Saturn return.
We all go through it.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the Saturn return.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.850 align:middle line:84%
That one is more to do
with the coding that's

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:90%
in the brain and the mind.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So if after the seven
years there's an agreement

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to do with mutual purpose--
it can be raising children,

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and that can hold
a couple together

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.520 align:middle line:84%
for the 28-year cycle--
but then if they're

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.330 align:middle line:84%
going to hold through for
another 28 years-- or 7 years

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.560 align:middle line:84%
or 14 years, whatever-- they
need to be reassessing what's

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.150 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of our life now?

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:90%
What's it for?

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It calls for a lot
of communication

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and then deliberate building
and putting into the field

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:90%
what it is that they want.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.904 align:middle line:90%
So we better become conscious.

00:56:38.904 --> 00:56:40.470 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: It's all about
becoming more conscious--

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:41.603 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you've
written about it

00:56:41.603 --> 00:56:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in your book that you can find
for $19.95 instead of $291--

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:52.670 align:middle line:84%
What a well of
inspiration for finding

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the correct relationship, or
re-charging and redefining
