00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:15.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.100 align:middle line:84%
With all of the demands
on your time these days,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:84%
between work and family
and relationships

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.075 align:middle line:84%
and a constant demand to
answer your email or your texts

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
all day, are you
feeling that you're

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
getting tugged in several
different directions?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that a
state of enlightenment

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is for other people
who have time

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.115 align:middle line:90%
for things like meditation?

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today is spiritual
teacher and cultural visionary,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Cohen.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to talk about
his book, "Evolutionary

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment: A New Path
to Spiritual Awakening"

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and how to achieve practical
spirituality without feeling

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
like you are being
tugged and split

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:90%
in several different directions.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW COHEN: Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled to be with you.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.716 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm glad you're
with me because you're

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
going to bring
this whole concept

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and topic of enlightenment
to a level that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is practical for
people like me, who

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
tend to live a little
bit of a busy life.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.915 align:middle line:84%
What is your perspective
of enlightenment?

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:10.934 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: My perspective
of enlightenment

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a big
question, I know.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's a very big
question to start with.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think probably
the word means

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
many things in many
different circumstances.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But I suppose, just to
begin our conversation,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
it means discovering, at an
experiential level, a sense

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of ultimacy, discovering
a non-relative or absolute

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
dimension or position in
relationship to life that

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
frees one from existential
doubt and existential fear.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us are
consciously and unconsciously

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
confused, knowingly
or unknowingly,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
about what's the point
of this experience?

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Is life good?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So experiences like
these really answer

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
these fundamental
existential questions

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
that all human beings have.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
For some people they're more
conscious; for other people

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:90%
they're less unconscious.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And essentially it
removes all doubt

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
about whether life is
good and whether I really

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
want to be here.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you get
started on this entire path

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
of your journey, your
spiritual journey?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I was brought up
in a secular Jewish household

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
in New York, so I
had no notion of God

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
or spirit or really
anything higher.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
was 16 years old,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Rome in
Italy with my mother.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting up
late one night having

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
a conversation--and I don't
remember what we were talking

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
about--but for no
particular reason,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.365 align:middle line:84%
the doors of perception opened,
and I had an experience.

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I had what's called a
transrational experience.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's difficult
to understand rationally,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:90%
but this is what happened.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So the doors of
perception opened,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.935 align:middle line:84%
and I became aware
of beginninglessness

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and endlessness, that which had
no beginning and no end, right?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.667 align:middle line:84%
All sense of boundaries and all
sense of limitation fell away.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it different than
the prior moments you were

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:90%
experiencing--

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Completely different.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --as a teenager?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Completely different.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It would be like living
in a small little cabin

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and opening the door and
falling into infinite space.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was a cosmic
cracking of consciousness.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I was literally
aware of the infinite.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:90%
It was more tangible.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
It was the awareness
of the infinite,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
or beginninglessness and
endlessness was more tangible,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
was more real in
those few moments

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
than anything else I'd ever
experienced in my life.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.636 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, is
what makes experiences

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
like that so extraordinary.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
There was a quality
of this infiniteness

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:90%
that was of overwhelming love.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was a kind
of love that it's

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
hard to relate to anything that
we normally relate to that word

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
because it was
completely overwhelming.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It was breathtaking.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It was crushing.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And it almost felt like
if the intensity of what

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.627 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing didn't
stop, I might not make it.

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:90%
I might not survive.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.835 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
how strong it was.

00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I was in a state of awe, and
I was in a state of wonder.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did your mother do?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.297 align:middle line:84%
Did she see this
happening in your face?

00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.891 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, tears were
streaming down my face.

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't even
crying, I was in a state

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of awe at the splendor
and the glory of it all.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
She didn't really know
what was happening to me.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We were in two
different dimensions.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Our physical bodies were
sitting in the same room,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
but we were in two completely
different dimensions

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at that
time that I'd recently

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
seen a documentary
about Buddhism.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.579 align:middle line:84%
And in that documentary, there
was an image of a huge statue

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the jungles
of Southeast Asia,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and there were hundreds
of monks prostrating

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
before this enormous
Buddha statue.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
But because I hadn't had
any experiences like this,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand why
any human being would

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
bow down and prostrate before--

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A statue.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --a statute.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.043 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even know
why a human being would

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:12.892 align:middle line:84%
want to prostrate
before anything.

00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in that
moment, I suddenly

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
understood what was
the sentiment that

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
was being expressed when
those monks were bowing down

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:90%
before the image of Lord Buddha.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that cause you to
want to go to those regions

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and find out more about it?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, not then.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't really know
what it was that was happening.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that in
those few moments--

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't exactly know
how long it lasted--

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I had been more in touch with
reality, more awake, more alive

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
than I had been in
all of my 16 years.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this made a very deep and
profound impression on my soul.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I
had other interests.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.824 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:56.115 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be a jazz musician.

00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:56.667 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really know what
to do with the experience.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.625 align:middle line:84%
I told people about
it, and most people

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any idea really
what it meant or what it was.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
At the end of this experience,
I received a message.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know this sounds like
a strange thing to say,

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
but what it was was, if you give
your life to me and me alone,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:90%
you have nothing to fear.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.647 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it meant.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And the implication
was that if I

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
didn't follow this
invitation from the unknown,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.235 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, that I was
going to be in trouble,

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
have a hard time.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I went on to pursue
my interest in music.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.214 align:middle line:90%
And when I was--

00:06:37.214 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you pay attention
to that message at the time,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
or just ignore it because you
didn't know what to do with it?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.811 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I just was
aware that it happened.

00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But you see, Lisa, I
didn't have any context

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.536 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to relate
to it or know what it meant.

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been interested
in these matters before.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.865 align:middle line:84%
It was like suddenly
diving deep into the ocean

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
after not even knowing
that the ocean existed.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Being in the
desert, right, right?

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.861 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Oh yeah, I didn't
even know the ocean existed.

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was a powerful
awakening experience.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.552 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, when
the experience was over,

00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
what to do with it.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But then when I was
in my early 20s,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I began to be haunted
by this event.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
difficult time in my-- I

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
was having, as a
young adult, things

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.128 align:middle line:84%
weren't going very
well in my life.

00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But I was being haunted
by this experience,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and there was a sense
that this was my calling.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain
point when I was 22,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.696 align:middle line:84%
I made up my mind
that I was going

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to devote my life to
the rediscovery of what

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:90%
had visited me spontaneously.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.315 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:36.565 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And at that point,
did you begin your travels?

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:37.657 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Where did you start?

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.656 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I was living
in New York at the time.

00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I did all the
things that seekers do.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to meditate.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I started getting up
very early and reading

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.432 align:middle line:84%
books about meditation
and yoga and philosophy.

00:07:55.432 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to learn everything.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see every possible
different kind of teacher

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.605 align:middle line:84%
from every different
kind of tradition.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I was voraciously curious.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been a
very skeptical person,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
curious and skeptical, but
also very sincere and earnest.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And I had many teachers.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I went through all kinds
of different experiences

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
with meditation with
different people,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with different individuals
and different groups.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.906 align:middle line:84%
And I was learning and learning
and learning and learning.

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:27.301 align:middle line:84%
And because I was a baby boomer,
when we became interested

00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
in spirit, we didn't look
to our own traditions.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.846 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm Jewish, I didn't
look to my own tradition.

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I looked to the East.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, all the
most famous luminaries,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
the greatest Indian spiritual
teachers and masters,

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%
were all coming to the West.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd also met
many people that

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.676 align:middle line:84%
had spent long periods
of time in India.

00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I met
them, I could tell

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't necessarily
that much more enlightened

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
than I was, which
meant that I knew

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that going to India,
itself, wasn't the answer.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But I felt very
compelled to go anyway.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.195 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point
when I was 27,

00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I felt I wanted to
go for a few months.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Part of your journey.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I
was just curious,

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.503 align:middle line:84%
even though I had already
had a lot of experiences

00:09:06.503 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and met many teachers
and that kind of thing.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived
there, I suddenly

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
felt an enormous
feeling of happiness.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.389 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was is because
I was a very dedicated seeker.

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wanted to become
an enlightened person.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
That was more important
to me than anything else.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you live in
New York City, everybody looks

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:90%
at, what do you do?

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says, what do you do?

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And I didn't really
have a very good response.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.325 align:middle line:84%
I would tell people what
I was interested in,

00:09:32.325 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and most people looked--
they were polite.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell
they couldn't relate

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to what I was
interested in, and they

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
thought I was little crazy.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would
tell them that you

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.186 align:middle line:84%
were interested in
becoming enlightened?

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:40.962 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.962 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I can't remember
exactly what I said--

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I mean, but that's
basically what you were-- yeah.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Something in that--
I mean, I wasn't naive.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.581 align:middle line:84%
I probably would
have put it in words

00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that would have
been at least they

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:90%
would have been receptive to.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.305 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't anything most
people could relate to.

00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I arrived
in India, I just

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
felt this freedom
that I could really

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.135 align:middle line:84%
pursue this passion I had
without any inhibitions.

00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because India is a place
where people can get

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.162 align:middle line:90%
lost, and they can also escape.

00:10:04.162 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place where
people can truly awaken.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.009 align:middle line:84%
So I had a small
income at the time.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:11.133 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't much, but it was
enough to live in India.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:12.799 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I wasn't
going to go back.

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you stayed.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: So I stayed.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed for
2 and 1/2 years.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.871 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
find a teacher there

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.832 align:middle line:84%
that you resonated
with and learned from?

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
right before I left,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I heard of a teacher who
eventually became very famous,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
but at that time he
was very little known.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
His name was H.W.L Poonja
or Poonjaji, or as Papaji

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
as he's become known.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was a disciple of the
great 20th-century renowned

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
spiritual master
Ramana Maharshi.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:90%
He was a direct disciple of his.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had never met a
master of Advaita Vedanta

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:84%
or a disciple of the
great Ramana Maharshi.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd heard a lot
about him from a friend,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and so I was very curious and
interested to go visit him.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.185 align:middle line:84%
I was actually on
my way to Korea.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go
live a life of a monk.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go live--
I knew at that point

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that this thing was
going to happen to me.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:90%
I was very convinced.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
confidence about it.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I just felt I needed
to be in a place

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.047 align:middle line:84%
where I'd be able to live
a very disciplined life.

00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was sure, sooner or later,
it was just a matter of time.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.199 align:middle line:84%
So I was more or less
on my way to leave India

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:90%
when I went to visit him.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, at the
time he was quite unknown.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
He was an old man.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
He was living in his
son's house in Lucknow.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into
the room to see him,

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
he was sitting on his
bed in an undershirt.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.815 align:middle line:84%
He was a family-- he'd
been a householder.

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:41.054 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't have religious
attire on or robes

00:11:41.054 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.511 align:middle line:84%
He was just sitting
in his undershirt

00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and alone on his bed.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.995 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been a seeker
for a long time.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I'd seen a lot of teachers.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to let him know
that I didn't expect much

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:90%
from him.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have
no expectations.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.651 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, that's good.

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And he obviously had
a tremendous amount

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of confidence, a deep,
otherworldly confidence.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat on the floor
in front of his bed.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was with a
friend, and we started

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:90%
asking him some questions.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, how much
effort does it take to be free?

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And he whispered, he
whispered, he said,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to make
any effort to be free.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And when he whispered
those few words,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
something happened inside
my being, my consciousness.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly became aware
of a brook of water

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
running down the side of a hill.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I realized that my true nature
was like that water, which

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
was that, like water, nothing
can obstruct the flow of water.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:90%
It was always free.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in that moment
that I had never been unfree,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that the illusion had
been-- that bondage

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
was an illusion, that there was
a block or something in my way

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:90%
had been the illusion.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
What was real, was true, and
what had always been true

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:90%
is that I'd always been free.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I just had never
known it before.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
looking at the ground.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
This probably took
about 10 seconds.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.555 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at the ground,
and he said, that's it!

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And he burst out.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and I
said, how did you know?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Because this was just 10 seconds
or 20 seconds of silence.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And he burst out laughing.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:90%
And that was the--

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He saw
that shift in you.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, well,
who is this man?

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So then I spent three
weeks in Lucknow,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and I stayed in some
small hotel by myself.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.662 align:middle line:84%
And I would go visit
him in the mornings,

00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and we'd go for walks.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go to
his-- I would usually

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
have lunch with his family
and his son's family.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.092 align:middle line:90%
Then I would go.

00:13:35.092 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Come back in the afternoons
after he had a nap,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and we'd spend time
going for walks,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
having talks, just
sitting quietly together.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And he answered a couple
of fundamental questions

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And one was I wanted to know-- I
had had this initial experience

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:84%
when I was a young
teenager of the fullness,

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of the effulgence of the
splendor of the absolute.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did he
uncover that for you?

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, right.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But then I had been
spending time with Buddhists

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.743 align:middle line:84%
and doing all kinds of
Buddhist meditations.

00:14:06.743 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha said
that "emptiness is

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate nature of reality."

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was very confused.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what is the
ultimate nature of reality?

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.895 align:middle line:84%
It was a very profound
existential question for me.

00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, what's
the ultimate truth?

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.179 align:middle line:90%
Is it fullness or emptiness?

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was it emptiness?

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.803 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And he said,
they're both two

00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:90%
sides of the same coin.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: So they are one.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And from one
perspective, there's

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
emptiness, and the other
perspective they're fullness.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
two, they're one.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So this relieved a
tremendous amount

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of existential doubt
and struggle I had.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
that happened,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
as I told him about this
extraordinary thing that

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
happened when I was 16,
this amazing visitation

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.729 align:middle line:84%
from the unknown, and I
told him in a lot of detail,

00:14:45.729 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at me and he said,
you already know everything.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.296 align:middle line:84%
And because of his tremendous
spiritual authority,

00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the minute he said that,
I could feel something let

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:90%
go in the core of my being.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
catapulted me into kind

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
of an altered state
of consciousness

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and catalyzed a process that
happened after I left him.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But this, it was
almost like that I

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
was able to accept at a very
deep level something that

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
had been revealed to me when
I was a very young person.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, after
three weeks, I was gonna--

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I left him for a few
weeks to go visit friends.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And he'd tell me, something very
big is going to happen to you.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, something very
big is going to happen to you.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
When I was with him, as often
happens in these circumstances,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I would go from
thinking that I'm

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
with some extraordinary
spiritual giant,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
some spiritual master that
the world does not know about,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.532 align:middle line:84%
to I'm with just some
crazy old man that

00:15:44.532 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what
he's talking about.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.767 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure that went--

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So when he told me
that something big was going

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to happen, I didn't know
what he was talking about.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how he could
possibly know anyway.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But then when I left him, I left
him and took the train to New

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Delhi, something happened,
some energetic current

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
had started to flow
inside my being.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't really
in my physical body,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.956 align:middle line:90%
but it's something that I felt.

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a current of bliss,
an intensity of energy

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
that would wax and wane.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It would get very intense, and
it would get to be too much,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and it would fall back again.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And this lasted for
about three weeks.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
was being consumed

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
by a presence, an energetic
presence that I couldn't see.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.244 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
incredible-- it

00:16:38.244 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
was the most incredible
time in my life.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
Delhi, I met a friend,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and I started telling them
what had happ-- you know,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
my time with this
extraordinary man.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I told them
the story, they

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
were catapulted into the
same state of consciousness

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't know
what was happening.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Because what was my-- what felt
like my own purely subjective

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
experience began to be this
inter-subjective or shared

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
experience with another person.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And this started
happening with all people

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.972 align:middle line:84%
that I was sharing
my process with.

00:17:07.972 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They actually started to
experience it directly

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.429 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.016 align:middle line:84%
When this happened,
this really--

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Blew your
mind, I'm sure, yes.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.307 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Blew my mind
in the biggest way.

00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that continued
for these three weeks.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it was an
energetic transmission

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%
almost of experience.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Very,
extremely powerfully.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And then after three weeks,
I went back to see him.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And all my doubts about him had
left, and I fell at his feet.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And he burst out laughing.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.747 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.747 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.345 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so
this was a real--

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:36.489 align:middle line:90%
it was a fairy tale story.

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
He thought at the time
he was going to die.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
He was quite ill.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So he told me, "I want you
to accept responsibility

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:90%
for the work," quote unquote.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I give you my robe and ball.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really know what
to make of all these things.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I was flipping
into another world

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that I felt I had no
background or training for.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I left him, and I went
with a small group of friends

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:90%
to Rishikesh in northern India.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.569 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Beatles
went to be with the Maharishi

00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:02.259 align:middle line:90%
on the Ganges.

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very famous area, yeah.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: We stayed there for,
it was for about six weeks.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a
spiritual teacher overnight.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.555 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching all
day and every night.

00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:15.902 align:middle line:84%
We'd all sit in my room
together, and we would spend--

00:18:15.902 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the teachings
that you had learned from--

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, no.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
What happened was it
was very spontaneous.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly had access to a
level of wisdom and depth

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.846 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge that I felt
I hadn't been trained for.

00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:29.762 align:middle line:90%
It suddenly was there.

00:18:29.762 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It was like going from 0 to 60.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And so then it was
really a process

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
of surrendering to a process
that was happening to me.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.065 align:middle line:84%
And I also had to be willing
to trust him unconditionally

00:18:40.065 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because he told me this
was going to be my destiny

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
I was going to do.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't
believe I was ready.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.748 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe I
could do such a thing.

00:18:47.748 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:90%
But I needed to trust him.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.185 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, it
was happening by itself.

00:18:52.185 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do
these concepts have

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to do with what you
teach around non-duality?

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, whenever we
use the word enlightenment,

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
we're always pointing to an
experience of non-duality.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
to understand

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the meaning of that
word has evolved and shifted

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
over time, especially in
relationship to Eastern

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and to
the Eastern traditions.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Non-dualism has?

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.598 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:19:17.598 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in the
original Buddhist teaching,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the original Buddhist
teaching, his enlightenment

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
was about the experience
of transcending the world

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
completely, about entering into
a very deep, meditative state.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And when
we meditate, when

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
we enter into a
meditative state,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:84%
we make the effort to
transcend the mind,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.234 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond the
thinking process.

00:19:40.234 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you go beyond the
mind and go beyond the thinking

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
process, as the conditioned
movement of thought

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.635 align:middle line:84%
moves into the background,
interestingly enough,

00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously our awareness
of the passing of time moves

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:90%
into the background.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And when thought and mind
move into the background,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:90%
time moves into the background.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So when thought and mind and
time move into the background,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.759 align:middle line:84%
our awareness of
the external world

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:90%
also moves into the background.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can understand that.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so
if we keep letting

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
go and keep letting
go, what will happen

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.815 align:middle line:84%
is when-- thought
eventually will disappear.

00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
When thought disappears,
time disappears.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.945 align:middle line:84%
When time disappears, our
awareness of the world

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:18.445 align:middle line:90%
disappears.

00:20:18.445 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
When our awareness of the world
disappears, if we keep letting

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
go and keep letting
go, eventually even

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
our sense of and awareness
of our own physical form

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.047 align:middle line:90%
disappears.

00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:29.755 align:middle line:84%
So when mind disappears,
time disappears.

00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
When time disappears,
world disappears.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.735 align:middle line:84%
When world disappears,
ultimately form disappears.

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:38.637 align:middle line:84%
So when everything disappears,
we make the greatest discovery

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that all the greatest
mystics from all

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
the great mystical
traditions had,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.705 align:middle line:84%
which is when everything
disappears, I'm still here.

00:20:45.705 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go anywhere.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.734 align:middle line:84%
That's not very
practical if I disappear.

00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, no.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But we realize, because we
usually think, I'm the body,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm the mind, I'm
the personality.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.051 align:middle line:84%
And you realize when all
of that has disappeared,

00:20:57.051 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
when there's not even--
and there's no memory left,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
our most intimately felt
sense of self is here

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and is experienced as
beginningless and emptiness--

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
beginningless and endless.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Who I am has no
beginning and no end.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
This is-- and this
is merely-- this

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is the human form, shape
and form of who I am.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.187 align:middle line:84%
So what the Buddha was
teaching was the awakening--

00:21:20.187 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the original Buddhist
teaching was awakening

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
to this timelessness
and formlessness, which

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
has been called the
ground of being,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:90%
timeless, formless being.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
original teaching, he

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
said that when you
awaken to being,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
you awaken to the unborn, to
the deathless, to the uncreated,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to that which exists
before time and space.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
You awaken to the
part of yourself

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:90%
that has never been born.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.383 align:middle line:84%
So when you awaken to
that part of yourself,

00:21:46.383 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
you realize that the deepest
dimension of yourself

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and the deepest dimension
of reality itself

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
is immortal and
uncreated and unborn.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
that, it frees you

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
from attachment to this body, to
this mind, to this personality.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
That was the Buddha's
original teaching.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's-- OK.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But then
about 800 years later

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism with the
Mahayana revolution,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
they realized that the nature of
the world, the nature of form,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately the same
as emptiness, all right.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The emptiness, this
timeless, formless

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
emptiness, this
ground of reality.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They realized that everything,
that the material world

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is one with and not separate
with this primary foundation

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:90%
of emptiness itself.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was when--
in the Heart Sutra

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha says,
"Form is emptiness

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and emptiness is form."

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Form and emptiness
are one and not two.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And so in Mahayana-- in Mahayana
Buddhism, the world of form

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
is also embraced as emptiness.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the feeling
of I need to escape the world

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
or transcend the world
in order to become

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
enlightened is not true anymore.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I can embrace
the world of form

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.264 align:middle line:84%
and use the experience of being
here in the world as a way

00:22:57.264 --> 00:22:58.180 align:middle line:90%
to become enlightened.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a third
turning of the wheel,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's what my
new book is all about.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
new enlightenment

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is all about, which is the
awakening to evolution.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we realize that it
was out of this primordial

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
emptiness, from this primordial
emptiness, this void,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that the Big Bang happened,
that the creative process

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
emerged from
primordial emptiness.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is when you
realize that everything

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that exists in the world
of time and space-- matter

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.165 align:middle line:84%
and energy, right, and sentient
life-- came from nothingness.

And we realize it's
actually going somewhere.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%

we're on a creative journey.

of that perfect contentment

you made a decision

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
You chose to manifest

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
arise to do something so vast,
so complex, so overwhelming?

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
What could be a
greater challenge

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
than to create something out of
nothing, to manifest a material

And considering the
fact that at the deepest

level of consciousness
itself, there is only one,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and that one is
who you always are,

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:44.925 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a
piece there that I'm

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:84%
wanting you to tie this
all together for me.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
How does this have--
What does this

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
have to do with our practical,
daily, busy, chaotic lives?

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.306 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned this non-duality.

00:27:58.306 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
trying to figure out here

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
is how do you bring this
cosmic consciousness,

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary enlightenment
conversation to a place where

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we are not so separate in
our thinking and so confused?

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, non-duality
means there's only one.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It technically means not two.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So it means that the ultimate
truth about who you are

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and who I am, and the ultimate
truth about the nature

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
of reality itself is that
there's only one and not two.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the-- I
mean, existentially,

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
human beings tend to
feel fearful and--

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.252 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.252 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Separate.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --frightened
and confused--

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And fragmented.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --when they
feel separate from.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So when one has a
mystical experience--

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and mystical
experiences are usually

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
an experience, of some way,
of the perennial truth,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the perennial
experience, recognition

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate truth
about the nature of reality

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and of the self, which is that
there's only one and not two.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So the way we can
define that is--

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.815 align:middle line:84%
there are different
ways to define that.

00:29:04.815 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
In the traditional
Eastern enlightenment,

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:84%
which is what I originally
learned from my teacher,

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
there is the-- he awakened me
to what the Buddha was pointing

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.277 align:middle line:84%
to, the deepest
dimension of reality

00:29:17.277 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and the deepest dimension of
the human experience, which

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
is this ground of being, this
place where there's no time

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and there's no space.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We enter into a very
deep state of meditation.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:84%
When everything
disappears, we become aware

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
of no time, no space, and no
form, and infinite freedom.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you experience
that, you realize everything

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
that exists comes from
this primordial ground.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.036 align:middle line:84%
And what's liberating
is I am, right, you

00:29:44.036 --> 00:29:47.862 align:middle line:84%
know, I am that
timeless, formless--

00:29:47.862 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Infinite space.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --infinite
space, right.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:90%
That's who I really am.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you come
back into the world then,

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense of no
longer being so attached to

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and identified all the
relative notions of self.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.474 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the idea that
we look at ourselves

00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
as separate from everything,
where our work is

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
separate than ourself,
that's separate

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
than our family, and
our relationships,

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
things are separate

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.839 align:middle line:84%
is where we're actually
draining off and siphoning off

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:13.569 align:middle line:84%
our energy to all of
these things that we

00:30:13.569 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:90%
think are separate.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying is
that that is all actually

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, that
that's all one thing,

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and that we don't have
to drain our energy.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:84%
That we could fill
ourselves up, basically,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
with all of the different things
that we do by realizing they're

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:90%
all one.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:35.476 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, when one has a
deep and profound experience

00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate unity of
being and of existence itself,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
when you realize it is all one,
I am and you are and we all

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
are that one without a second,
right, I am and you are,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:52.267 align:middle line:84%
we all are, and this all is
part and parcel of one event,

00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:52.975 align:middle line:90%
of one happening.

00:30:52.975 --> 00:30:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:84%
When I realize that is
my identity, right, not

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
my separate personality, not
my personal identity, not

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.737 align:middle line:84%
my ethnic identity, not
my national identity--

00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --but this is who
I am, it's who you are,

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.835 align:middle line:84%
we realize it's all part of
one process and one happening.

00:31:12.835 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we make that
shift of identity,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.817 align:middle line:84%
we no longer see this
being separate from that,

00:31:18.817 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
or that being separate
from the other thing,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.608 align:middle line:90%

I have different life
circumstances than you do.

Maybe certain things
that are challenging me

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that are different than
what your challenges are.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:90%
But the thing is--

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you see all
of this is happening

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.885 align:middle line:84%
within the context of
it being one happening,

00:31:51.885 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:90%
it changes the way we see it.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:90%
We see it's all one event.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I see my own
personal inner experience,

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:84%
my own personal
challenges, and what's

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
happening-- events
that are happening

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:84%
in the world at large, globally,
as all part of one unfolding.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:32:09.515 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So is part of a financial
devastation or a global crisis

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.860 align:middle line:84%
all part of this
oneness as well?

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's all part of one
process that is in progress.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like one big movie.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It's one big-- it's one
big show that's happening.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's no part of that
particular movie that's

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:84%
separate from any
other part, ultimately,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
from a mystical
perspective, you see?

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when you realize, we
cease to compartmentalize--

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to really answer your question--
we cease to compartmentalize

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.720 align:middle line:90%
the way we see our lives.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So often, many people
will say, well,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.382 align:middle line:84%
I have a spiritual practice
for 10 minutes a day,

00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
or 20 minutes a
day, or whatever it

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.260 align:middle line:84%
is, where I want to connect
with my notion of whatever

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:90%
the absolute is.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I have my
day-to-day life.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And I try to tell everyone, what
happens every day is your life.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole thing.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.781 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the point.

00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so we want to stop
because it's all one unfolding.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.687 align:middle line:84%

when you see it

00:33:04.687 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
all from a perspective
of non-duality,

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.564 align:middle line:90%
it's all a spiritual happening.

00:33:07.564 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, though,
how do you explain

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
the pain that people are in,
and the devastation that people

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:84%
feel, or when you experience
the death of a loved one?

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.885 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that's really
all the same experience?

00:33:17.885 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I mean,
death is part of life.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, death is part of life.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an inseparable
part of life.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we truly embrace
the inherent unity

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
of all existence, we also have
to accept the truth of change.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha said,
"Everything changes."

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that which is
born is ultimately

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:90%
going to die and pass away.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But we realize that the creative
process itself is immortal.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And that original
experience I told you

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that I had when I
was a teenager, one

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of the profound things
that became clear to

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.835 align:middle line:84%
me is that there's no such
thing as death, right?

00:33:51.835 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.739 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is is that which
is born is going to die.

00:33:56.739 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
This body is going
to die eventually,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and that body's going to die.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But the energy and
intelligence that gave

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:05.455 align:middle line:84%
rise to the creative
process itself is immortal.

00:34:05.455 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So who you ultimately
are, who you really

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:84%
are, who I ultimately and
really am is immortal.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to learn how
to expand our perspective

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
and see the relative
nature of who

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:84%
we are, this body, this
mind, this personality,

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.825 align:middle line:84%
and the relative circumstances
of this particular life

00:34:26.825 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
as relative circumstances
within an infinite process

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:90%
of unfolding.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So then I also want to ask
you about how this relates

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to self-confidence and
how we would experience

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.400 align:middle line:84%
being truly authentic with
who we are without feeling

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're stuck in
things like pain.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And this has a lot to do with
what you talk about in terms

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.822 align:middle line:84%
of a narcissistic society
that we have become.

00:34:51.822 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different conversation

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.071 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
in just a second.

00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's-- there's a great
piece that you've got here that

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
talks about our authentic
self and who we truly are.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.415 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
this because we'll

00:35:03.415 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
talk about this piece
in just a second.

>>What I'm calling the authentic
self, or the creative principle

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%
or Eros, only reveals
itself through action.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:90%


00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:84%
When something came
from nothing, right,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.790 align:middle line:84%
there was a movement
from absolute stillness

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:90%
to unceasing activity.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.452 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
What I'm calling
the authentic self

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.888 align:middle line:84%
does not reveal
itself in meditation.

00:35:47.888 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't awaken to the
authentic self in meditation.

So the authentic self is-- how
you see it, it's unmistakable.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.260 align:middle line:84%
It's this unselfconscious
creativity.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Any creative individual,
from a genius trial lawyer

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to a passionate,
ego-less public servant

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to a great poet or
writer-- anybody

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:84%
who's completely committed
to the creative endeavor

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.825 align:middle line:84%
at any level, who reached
a level of mastery

00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:84%
where there's an unselfconscious
intelligence that's surging

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.680 align:middle line:84%
through them expressing
that which transcends,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.676 align:middle line:84%
but it includes, but
transcends the world,

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.195 align:middle line:84%
that's what the
authentic self is.

00:36:53.195 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So usually this is
understood as kind

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:90%
of-- it's called creativity.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But what I've done with this
notion of authentic self

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is to say, well,
OK, now we're not

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:84%
talking about making
music or making art.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.610 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about freeing
the self so the self

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.238 align:middle line:84%
itself can become the instrument
that's playing that music.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So how are these concepts
practical to us today?

How do you get here?

00:37:45.212 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:90%
How do you get to this place?

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
teachings around that?

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I think--
I mean, the first thing

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
here is we have to be willing
to experience enormous-- allow

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to experience enormous
frustration at the generally

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:84%
superficial relationships
to existence that many of us

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.670 align:middle line:84%
seem to tolerate without
it really bothering us.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to get to
a point, I believe,

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.410 align:middle line:84%
where we get fed up with
living on the surface of life.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a certain
point, I think, when we get to--

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.414 align:middle line:84%
and this happened
in my own life--

00:38:23.414 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:84%
when I kind of
realized, you know,

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:28.299 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't really wake
up, if I didn't achieve

00:38:28.299 --> 00:38:29.715 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
enormous breakthrough

00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and big transformation,
I was never

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:90%
going to really be fully alive.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what do you
mean by that frustration?

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.121 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
there's a frustration.

00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's a
sense that, what am I doing?

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Like what am I doing,
and why am I doing it?

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And whose life am
I living anyway?

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.212 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.212 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us aren't really
living our own lives.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.586 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to live
an authentic life,

00:38:49.586 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
we really have to-- we
have to dig very deep.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to
struggle with very big ideas,

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.040 align:middle line:84%
challenge ourself, face
into the big questions,

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.047 align:middle line:84%
peer way beyond the
boundaries of where

00:39:02.047 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:90%
most people are willing to look.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.820 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.592 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
be willing to get fed up

00:39:08.592 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
with a life that's not
being lived with depth.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:17.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to live a
life of meaning and mastery

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and what I call spiritual
self-confidence,

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:84%
we have to be willing to make
the effort to break through

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to the very center of what it
means to exist and to know that

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the steps,
the how-to steps to this,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and the one, two, three to
that, or to breathing to relax

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, is
really us just trying

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.055 align:middle line:84%
to put a Band-Aid
on the frustration

00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're feeling with life?

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, these
days, you know, it's here.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's also true
in India, by the way.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of
time there recently.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:84%
People experience
a lot of stress.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Life is very stressful.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The speed in which we're living
is getting quicker and quicker.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So it does create
a lot of stress.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It creates a lot of
insecurity, and it

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:90%
creates a lot of anxiety.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So understandably, people
look to spiritual teachers

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
methodologies as a way

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.565 align:middle line:84%
to calm down, to feel less
stressful and less frightened.

00:40:10.565 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn how
to meditate, and we

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.550 align:middle line:84%
learn some breathing exercises
and this kind of thing,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.406 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
stretch our bodies out

00:40:17.406 --> 00:40:19.114 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of thing,
we can find a way

00:40:19.114 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:84%
to experience a little bit
more equanimity or being

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:90%
less anxious.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's a deeper
question, which

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.190 align:middle line:90%
is you can calm yourself down.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We can calm down and
feel more peaceful.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily
mean we've really

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.160 align:middle line:84%
made any profound
breakthroughs that

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
have liberated us
on a soul level.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's more
of a temporary level.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.498 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, it's just a shift
in our emotional experience.

00:40:41.498 --> 00:40:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Instead of feeling
stressed out, we calm down.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.625 align:middle line:84%
You can have a couple of
drinks and calm down also.

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
necessarily change or affect

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:90%
the state of one's soul at all.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So what does is--
all the greatest

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:84%
philosophers and the greatest
mystics throughout history

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
are individuals who
realized that they

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
had to get to the
very bottom of it.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get to the bottom
of what it means to exist.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And when-- and it's--
and we can do that.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.365 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest luminaries,
spiritual luminaries

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, are
individuals, men and women,

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.865 align:middle line:84%
who are kind of
spiritual heroes.

00:41:11.865 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:84%
They've broken through to a
level of depth of experience

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and perspective
and understanding,

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.710 align:middle line:84%
where they really know,
where they're grounded.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:84%
They're grounded at a level of
depth that, for most people,

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.305 align:middle line:90%
is unimaginable.

00:41:25.305 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that are the
spiritual practices that we

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.905 align:middle line:84%
do, assuming we're
doing any, are

00:41:32.905 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:84%
as powerful as is our
aspiration to truly become

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.550 align:middle line:84%
a liberated,
transformed individual.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.117 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a lot of us,
we're already on a trajectory.

00:41:44.117 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
We're already going.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:90%
We're very busy.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And we want to find
a way to feel better

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:90%
doing what we're already doing.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
When the question is maybe we
don't know what the heck we're

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:84%
doing, and there might be
a much more wholesome, more

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
philosophically profound
and spiritually honest

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
relationship to life that we
have to be willing to consider.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But most people are afraid
to think too deeply,

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
to question too deeply,
to ask questions

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that are too big because
they might find out

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:90%
that they've made wrong choices.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.105 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, we have to
be willing to do that.

00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to ask ourselves

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:84%
those kind of
questions, you know.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.069 align:middle line:90%
We want to get on solid ground.

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So maybe the
questions or the goals

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:84%
of making more money, or
getting to the bigger house,

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or climbing the corporate
ladder, or whatever those goals

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.805 align:middle line:84%
and aspirations are,
when you get there

00:42:25.805 --> 00:42:28.676 align:middle line:84%
and you find emptiness, you
realize that that's not really

00:42:28.676 --> 00:42:29.550 align:middle line:90%
the true goal at all.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.966 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well
that's what we hear.

00:42:30.966 --> 00:42:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We hear, you know-- it hasn't
been my experience in life,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.920 align:middle line:84%
but we hear from
people who have thought

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that wealth, enormous wealth,
would give them happiness.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Apparently they find
that it's not true,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that wealth and
power, especially

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.155 align:middle line:84%
for thoughtful, sensitive
people, doesn't liberate.

00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:48.462 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.462 --> 00:42:49.465 align:middle line:90%
And quite the opposite.

00:42:49.465 --> 00:42:53.060 align:middle line:84%
It can-- also can create
enormous anxiety and confusion.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This, yes, duality
ultimately, dualism.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Dualism or worse.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the fundamental
thing we're speaking about here

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:90%
is just finding a way.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Just using spiritual techniques
or teachings as a way

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.545 align:middle line:84%
simply to calm down, I
think, is not really enough.

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to make the effort

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to want to really break through
to something very profound

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that will realign our
relationship to existence

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in a fundamental way, a
fundamental realignment

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
in which we become
deeply grounded in life,

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and in being, and in the
knowledge of who we are

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:90%
and why we're here.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to do that, we
have to basically realize

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
where we are as a society
and then get to that point,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:84%
because several of us don't even
know that that level exists.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.854 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take a quick break.

00:43:44.854 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to explore more

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.530 align:middle line:84%
about how to live with
non-duality and non-separatism

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.427 align:middle line:84%
when we come back with
my guest Andrew Cohen.

00:43:52.427 --> 00:43:53.260 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:44:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Andrew
Cohen, and we're

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about practical and
evolutionary enlightenment.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
before the break

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.740 align:middle line:84%
about how to take the
concepts of non-duality

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to
our everyday life.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And how do you have
goals and aspirations

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're realizing that
everything is interconnected?

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So you explained that we're
in this era of a postmodern

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:90%
predicament.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
whole notion of what

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I call the postmodern
predicament is

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that since the '60s
generation-- I'm a baby boomer.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm 56.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:42.104 align:middle line:84%
And you look like you're maybe
next generation after me.

00:44:42.104 --> 00:44:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Getting there, yeah.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.454 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:44:43.454 --> 00:44:45.037 align:middle line:84%
But so starting with
the baby boomers,

00:44:45.037 --> 00:44:46.810 align:middle line:84%
the postwar generation,
and our children,

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and our children's
children, we fall

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.190 align:middle line:84%
into the category of whom I
call the luckiest people that

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:90%
have ever been born.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We are-- We
experience a standard

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of living that's historically
unprecedented-- wealth,

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
comfort, a level
of education that's

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.620 align:middle line:90%
historically unprecedented.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
We have freedom of thought,
freedom of opinion,

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:90%
freedom of movement.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:07.492 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.492 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of us can more or less
do anything that we want.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We could travel
wherever we want.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Within reason,
we can more or less

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:13.928 align:middle line:90%
do anything we imagine.

00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you're talking
about-- those things

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that you're saying with access
to education, and access

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.316 align:middle line:84%
to higher education, and
so forth, all of this

00:45:21.316 --> 00:45:22.090 align:middle line:90%
requires money.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.453 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is there are many,

00:45:24.453 --> 00:45:27.210 align:middle line:84%
many-- there's many, many, many,
many of us, billions of us,

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:27.710 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it starts with
the postwar generation,

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:84%
the baby boomer generation,
our children, our children's

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.074 align:middle line:84%
children fall into the category
of, historically speaking,

00:45:36.074 --> 00:45:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the luckiest people
that have ever

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.480 align:middle line:84%
been born in the history
of human civilization

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.271 align:middle line:84%
for all the reasons
that we just described.

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.130 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting--
what's interesting

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.500 align:middle line:84%
is that, objectively,
it's true we

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:84%
are luckier than any other
group of human beings

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.250 align:middle line:90%
that's ever been born.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.907 align:middle line:84%
But we don't seem to feel lucky,
or we don't seem to know that--

00:45:53.907 --> 00:45:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --we're the luckiest.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.331 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to know a lot of
these so-called luckiest people

00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that have ever been
born, if you get

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.996 align:middle line:84%
to know what their inner
lives are like, a lot of us

00:46:03.996 --> 00:46:08.870 align:middle line:84%
feel-- experience alienation,
existential confusion,

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.129 align:middle line:84%
victimization, a lot
of victimization.

00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Loneliness.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.378 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Loneliness
and insecurity.

00:46:13.378 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that creates quite a--
there's quite an irony in that,

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that the luckiest people
that have ever been born

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.010 align:middle line:84%
in the history of human
civilization generally

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.730 align:middle line:84%
don't recognize the fact that
they're the luckiest people

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.940 align:middle line:90%
that have ever been born--

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're still
trying to achieve--

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --and don't
feel very lucky.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so
that's a very big part

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.160 align:middle line:90%
of the postmodern predicament.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
solution to this-- this

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:90%
is a cultural epidemic.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a personal problem.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so how do
you create the future,

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.135 align:middle line:84%
where-- and how does
that relate to evolution?

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:47.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- I mean,
we're into this place

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of constantly wanting to
improve the quality of our lives

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
through this, that,
and the other thing.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:84%
How do you go towards the future
and still create this feeling

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.304 align:middle line:90%
of--?

00:46:57.304 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, there's one
other element to the postmodern

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.855 align:middle line:84%
predicament, which
is that in the '60s,

00:47:01.855 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
there was-- the cultural
revolutions that

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:84%
were so dramatic and
extraordinary that happened

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.540 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s were all
about-- it was all about

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.460 align:middle line:84%
liberation, liberation
of the individual.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so this gave rise
to the women's movement, which

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:14.860 align:middle line:84%
was such a profoundly
progressive step

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.460 align:middle line:90%
forward for culture.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was the
Civil Rights Movement

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
for the equal rights
for any individual.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.927 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
the Me Generation.

00:47:23.927 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:90%
It was all about me.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up in that time.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.100 align:middle line:84%
My parents said,
sweetheart, you should

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.570 align:middle line:84%
do whatever is going
to make you happy.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And my
teachers told me,

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.993 align:middle line:84%
you should do whatever is
going to make you happy.

00:47:32.993 --> 00:47:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So I, like many of my-- like
many others from my generation,

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I just grew thinking that
the world was my oyster.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever told me
that I had an obligation

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to anyone or anything.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.136 align:middle line:84%
I just simply looked
at life at how--

00:47:46.136 --> 00:47:48.790 align:middle line:84%
what was I going to do that
was going to make me happy.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And this has created a
culture of narcissism.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And my generation
tends to be-- we

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:90%
tend to be very narcissistic.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.892 align:middle line:84%
Our children-- Our children
tend to be very narcissistic.

00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't you think
the Millennials and all

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.650 align:middle line:84%
the generations right
now tend to be that way?

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it's
largely for these reasons.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the postmodern
predicament

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is both that we're the luckiest
people that have ever been born

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
it, plus the fact

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have grown up in a
culture of narcissism, which

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.300 align:middle line:84%
tends to have made
us very profoundly

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.055 align:middle line:84%
self-centered and
self-concerned.

00:48:17.055 --> 00:48:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And a narcissistic
individual is someone

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.000 align:middle line:90%
who thinks about me 24/7.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Only me.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:90%
How is it going to work for me?

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah, and right.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.230 align:middle line:90%
And I always tell people--

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does
that apply to me?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people
it's not a personal problem.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.251 align:middle line:90%
It's a cultural epidemic.

00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:30.789 align:middle line:90%
And so what do we do about this?

00:48:30.789 --> 00:48:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So psychotherapy is
not going to help

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.955 align:middle line:84%
us deal with the
problem of narcissism.

00:48:33.955 --> 00:48:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that,
to me, that human life,

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
if it's not connected to a deep
source of meaning and purpose--

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:48.979 align:middle line:84%
in other words, that my--
without it being connected with

00:48:48.979 --> 00:48:50.520 align:middle line:84%
a deep source of
meaning and purpose,

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.177 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find
ourself adrift,

00:48:53.177 --> 00:48:55.260 align:middle line:84%
experiencing all the things
we spoke about before,

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.259 align:middle line:90%
alienation--

00:48:56.259 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Loneliness.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --alienation,
loneliness.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Achieving the dream
and never getting there.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And also existential
confusion, like why am I here?

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people even say, I
didn't ask to be born.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.585 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
I want to be here.

00:49:05.585 --> 00:49:07.465 align:middle line:84%
I mean, outrageous
things like that.

00:49:07.465 --> 00:49:09.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And shallower
relationships.

00:49:09.055 --> 00:49:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
shallower relationships.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And for example, now, for
example, with birth control,

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:84%
many people choose
to have children

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.500 align:middle line:84%
because they feel,
if I have a child,

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.090 align:middle line:84%
it will give me a
sense of purpose.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.048 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong
with having children.

00:49:22.048 --> 00:49:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful and a
good thing to have-- to do.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But if people have
children because they

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.503 align:middle line:84%
don't feel a sense
of purpose, it

00:49:29.503 --> 00:49:33.730 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem to be-- it's a sign
that, at the level of culture,

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.360 align:middle line:90%
something's missing.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- to me-- so
therefore, the solution

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to this postmodern
predicament is

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of a non-relative
or an absolute context,

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.590 align:middle line:84%
a big source of meaning
for why I'm here

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:90%
and for why you're here.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't discover
a bigger sense of purpose

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.640 align:middle line:84%
for why I exist,
for why you exist,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.209 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be looking
for more relative ways

00:49:57.209 --> 00:49:59.000 align:middle line:84%
to find a source of
meaning that ultimately

00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to do it.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, human beings have been--

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.310 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
answer to that question

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.600 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, now in
the 21st century,

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.850 align:middle line:90%
is the awakening to evolution.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Evolution's the biggest new
idea in the last 200 years.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it gets us out
of a place of narcissism

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.424 align:middle line:84%
and into an evolutionary
conversation.

00:50:17.424 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:84%
You're saying
that's the solution?

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.465 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, because
the question is,

00:50:20.465 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:84%
well, we want to blow open
the context of my life.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So if my life is all about
me and my personal fears

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and personal desires, the
context is completely narrow.

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
happens is all in

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.240 align:middle line:84%
this small, self-referential--
self-referencing.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survivalistic.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.145 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But it's a
bubble of self-reference.

00:50:36.145 --> 00:50:36.606 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.606 --> 00:50:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
teaching people

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.600 align:middle line:84%
about what science has
discovered about who we are,

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.130 align:middle line:90%
it blows people's minds.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what that
means is that we're

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.110 align:middle line:84%
part of a process, a
cosmic process, that

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:52.180 align:middle line:84%
blew into existence
14 billion years ago.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great mystery that
out of no thing whatsoever,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:84%
there was this huge,
cosmic explosion, which

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.470 align:middle line:90%
gave rise to matter and energy.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.080 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Matter and energy
gave rise to life.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And life gave rise to
mind and consciousness,

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
self-consciousness,
subjectivity, interiority,

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.055 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:51:16.055 --> 00:51:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about--
when we realize

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.220 align:middle line:84%
that, we begin to see--
our sense of history

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.621 align:middle line:84%
begins to go from just
me and my personal life--

00:51:25.621 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and not just the history
of me personally,

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:84%
not just this
history of my family

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:84%
or my ethnic group or my nation,
but the history of the cosmos

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.210 align:middle line:84%
then relates to my experience
of my physical experience,

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.100 align:middle line:84%
my biological experience, my
experience of consciousness

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and cognition that relates
back to the beginning

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I realize that the-- that all
of my exper-- all the experience

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm having right now
is inherently related

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.776 align:middle line:84%
to the creative process,
right, that my body is made up

00:51:57.776 --> 00:52:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of atoms and
molecules, that we're

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.630 align:middle line:84%
born at the very
beginning of this process.

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I realize that my
mind and capacity

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.820 align:middle line:84%
for thinking about life
and assuming perspectives

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.830 align:middle line:84%
is related to the
evolution of human culture.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.910 align:middle line:84%
That my aspiration to want
to become more conscious

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:18.120 align:middle line:84%
is related to the fact that
the universe is actually

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to evolve at the
level of consciousness.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you experience the
spiritual impulse, which

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is the aspiration to
become more conscious,

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:29.830 align:middle line:84%
you realize, well,
who I am is really

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:32.212 align:middle line:84%
the energy and intelligence
that created the universe

00:52:32.212 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and is creating the universe.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.500 align:middle line:90%
It's called Eros.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the drive to exist.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.368 align:middle line:84%
It's the creative
motive in the universe.

00:52:37.368 --> 00:52:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And that motive is trying to
understand itself, know itself,

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:84%
realize itself, recognize
itself, and give rise to itself

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.227 align:middle line:90%
through me in my best moments.

00:52:47.227 --> 00:52:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And I realize, well, that's
what's happening here,

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.445 align:middle line:84%
that this body, this
mind, this personality,

00:52:51.445 --> 00:52:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is a sh-- this is a sheath.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:54.956 align:middle line:90%
The body's a sheath.

00:52:54.956 --> 00:52:56.455 align:middle line:84%
The mind and the
personality are a--

00:52:56.455 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:84%
or is a sheath through which
the energy and intelligence that

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
created the universe and
is creating the universe

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.500 align:middle line:90%
can engage with itself.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.866 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.866 --> 00:53:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That human-- with
human consciousness,

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
with highly evolved
human consciousness,

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.650 align:middle line:84%
evolution can become
conscious of itself.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Evolution awakens to itself.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's no space
for narcissism in evolution.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no space for survival,
really, in evolution,

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:84%
if you are taking this
concept of the stress

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:90%
that we are experiencing.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And you gave me a
great answer earlier

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.090 align:middle line:84%
about the internal
stress that we

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.360 align:middle line:84%
feel that we're experiencing
is actually creative stress.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you could reframe
the whole concept

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.262 align:middle line:84%
into this creative
stress, that is a great--

00:53:41.262 --> 00:53:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, there's positive
stress and negative stress.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.107 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
for example, if, you

00:53:46.107 --> 00:53:48.050 align:middle line:84%
know-- if you,
for example, let's

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.470 align:middle line:84%
say you're trying to-- you
want to run up a mountain,

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.520 align:middle line:84%
or you want to run a
marathon or something.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And so then you--
that's gonna take-- you

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.521 align:middle line:84%
are going to engage
with enormous stress

00:53:58.521 --> 00:53:59.770 align:middle line:90%
in order to achieve your goal.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's positive
because you're trying

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.099 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do something that
maybe you've never done before.

00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- what you're
doing is very constructive.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And so because you're trying
to achieve a goal that you've

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:84%
never achieved before,
you're engaging

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.500 align:middle line:84%
with stress very
consciously and deliberately

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.249 align:middle line:84%
so you can make a
breakthrough to a higher

00:54:18.249 --> 00:54:20.370 align:middle line:90%
level of your own capacity.

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you experience
stress then,

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's experienced
as a positive stress.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's in
your way that's dragging you

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.820 align:middle line:84%
down, that's making you
feel miserable all the time.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It's regenerating
self, actually.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's life generating.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you're engaging
with the stress,

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.020 align:middle line:84%
it's making it
possible for you to--

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.205 align:middle line:90%


00:54:39.205 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To grow.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, to grow
and to realize capacities

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't be
able to do unless you

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.850 align:middle line:90%
engage with that stress.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize that the
creative process as a whole

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.837 align:middle line:84%
is very stressful,
that, for example,

00:54:52.837 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
when nothing came-- to put
it in theological terms, when

00:54:55.170 --> 00:55:00.100 align:middle line:84%
God created the universe, it
wasn't a big peaceful event.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The creative process
isn't peaceful.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.139 align:middle line:84%
The creative process is
one big explosion, right?

00:55:04.139 --> 00:55:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It was one big explosion.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.151 align:middle line:90%


00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:12.039 align:middle line:84%
And life could only
emerge because stars

00:55:12.039 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:90%
collided into each other.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.538 align:middle line:84%
When they collided
into each other,

00:55:14.538 --> 00:55:16.299 align:middle line:84%
they created more
complex compounds

00:55:16.299 --> 00:55:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that would create
the conditions that

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.804 align:middle line:84%
would make it possible
for life to emerge.

00:55:19.804 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the whole process
of the evolution of life

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.880 align:middle line:84%
itself is all about
positive friction.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.341 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.341 --> 00:55:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if you observe
people making love,

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:33.490 align:middle line:84%
life gives rise to itself from
creative or positive friction,

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:90%
right, biologically.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And also at the
level of culture.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.590 align:middle line:84%
When you see-- when philosophers
are struggling with ideas,

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.895 align:middle line:84%
there's a positive
creative friction.

00:55:41.895 --> 00:55:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.860 align:middle line:84%
When you see marvelous jazz
musicians that are improvising,

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:90%
there's a creative friction.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So the-- which is--
you can see which--

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So creativity is inherently
about positive stress

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.250 align:middle line:90%
or positive friction.

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:57.070 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:58.534 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.534 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
that the creative process

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is about positive stress
or positive friction--

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.317 align:middle line:84%

That's a great term.

he or she is

convinced in the overwhelmingly
positive nature of existence?

00:56:57.575 --> 00:57:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So what if you were
convinced beyond any doubt

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:04.612 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever that
to exist is good,

00:57:04.612 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that the will towards
existence is positive?

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.720 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people aren't so sure.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.495 align:middle line:84%
Because they say, well, look,
you know, there's poverty.

00:57:14.495 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:90%
There's inequality.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.370 align:middle line:84%
There's environmental
degradation.

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.830 align:middle line:84%
There's fascism, and all
kinds of awful things

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:21.670 align:middle line:90%
happen in the world.

Nature has tsunamis

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.697 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very
dangerous place to be.

00:57:29.697 --> 00:57:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, life is a kind
of a dicey thing.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.946 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're going to get.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:44.650 align:middle line:84%
can happen, do happen,
will happen, have always

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.560 align:middle line:84%
been part of the process,
we're start-- suddenly

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.720 align:middle line:84%
we're not so sure that
to exist is too good.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.864 align:middle line:84%
We can say, well,
living-- to exist is good,

00:57:51.864 --> 00:57:52.780 align:middle line:90%
but then there's pain.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.345 align:middle line:90%
There's suffering.

00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:53.960 align:middle line:90%
There's death.

00:57:55.607 --> 00:57:56.440 align:middle line:90%
What about all that?

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.398 align:middle line:90%
Why is there suffering?

00:57:57.398 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
How could God exist as
long as there's pain?

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.410 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing, right?

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So what if, in the midst of all
this complexity and adversity,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:09.180 align:middle line:84%
if you knew without any
doubt that the urge to exist,

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:12.590 align:middle line:84%
which relates to the Big
Bang-- I interpret the Big Bang

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.157 align:middle line:84%
as the desire to exist
in time and in form.

00:58:15.157 --> 00:58:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So what if you knew without any
doubt that the desire to exist

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.471 align:middle line:84%
was overwhelmingly
positive, in spite

00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:21.720 align:middle line:84%
of all the terrible things
that happen in the process,

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.880 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of it?

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.667 align:middle line:84%
But if you knew that
the will to exist,

00:58:25.667 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:84%
which started with the Big
Bang, and which we experience

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.105 align:middle line:84%
as the sexual impulse,
as the creative impulse,

00:58:31.105 --> 00:58:33.840 align:middle line:84%
as creative inspiration--
that the will to exist,

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the will towards life, and
the will towards creativity

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.510 align:middle line:84%
is overwhelmingly
positive, without any--

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.197 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely
positive and good.

00:58:41.197 --> 00:58:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Would that change your

>>COHEN: Well, first, I
think, what we have to do

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:26.280 align:middle line:84%
is we have to realize that the
evolutionary process is always

And so a big part
of this shift has

00:59:40.114 --> 00:59:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to do with a shift of our
own consciousness, a shift

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of our own perspective
that we can see.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:48.070 align:middle line:84%
We feel that we're all part
of this trajectory, right?

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- It's a-- This
movement is happening

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.375 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the cosmos.

00:59:52.375 --> 00:59:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It's happening at
the level of biology,

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening at
the level of culture.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.560 align:middle line:90%
We're on a moving train.

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.780 align:middle line:90%
We're going somewhere.

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.382 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all
about change, too.

00:59:59.382 --> 01:00:00.840 align:middle line:84%
We can't go somewhere
unless things

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.830 align:middle line:90%
continue to change, right?

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, evolution
is really about emergence.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
notion of emergence,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.657 align:middle line:84%
which originally came to us from
biology, is-- reveals to us,

01:00:12.657 --> 01:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
really, the mystery of
the creative process.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is, how can
greater complexity

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.100 align:middle line:90%
emerge from lesser complexity?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.095 align:middle line:84%
And this is when there
are these leaps forward.

01:00:22.095 --> 01:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a sud--
Suddenly, something

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.670 align:middle line:84%
emerges that, from a
human point of view,

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.995 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have previously
imagined would be possible.

01:00:29.995 --> 01:00:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like the internet--

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: For example.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --for example.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.595 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah,
yeah, for example.

01:00:33.595 --> 01:00:34.400 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But why this is very-- the
whole notion of emergence,

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
how that relates to the new
evolutionary spirituality

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is that once we
have-- once we've

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
realized a level of wealth
and material comfort

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and abundance that the
luckiest people that are ever

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
born already have, what is
the purpose of our existence?

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Are we here merely just to--
so we can achieve a greater

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
level of comfort, so
that we can consume more,

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
so we can experience a greater
level of peace and well being?

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Are we here just to consume?

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.779 align:middle line:84%
And I think that once we
to the point where we're

01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
no longer living at
the level of survival--

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and for most of human
history, most human beings

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:16.445 align:middle line:90%
have been doing that.

01:01:16.445 --> 01:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But once life isn't
about survival,

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.430 align:middle line:90%
it becomes about creativity.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Less about consumption
and more about creativity.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.745 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it begins to take
on a religious-- or religious

01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual-- a religious or
spiritual sense of purpose.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The creative process
begins to take

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
on a religious or
spiritual magnitude for us.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
is my relationship

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to life inherently creative?

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Am I--

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is, we have
to understand that evolution

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
used to happen at an
unconscious level biologically.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The evolutionary process
happens at an unconscious level.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.659 align:middle line:84%
But now at the level
of human culture,

01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we
think about our future,

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
where we're going at
the level of culture,

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of our shared culture,
depends upon the choices

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
we make, the actions we take.

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we're--
so the future,

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of culture, is
only going to happen through

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:09.945 align:middle line:90%
our conscious--

01:02:09.945 --> 01:02:11.487 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Conscious
decisions, actions.

01:02:11.487 --> 01:02:13.278 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah, but our
conscious aspiration

01:02:13.278 --> 01:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to go to places at
the level of culture

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
that we've never been before.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And so are we-- because
where we are now culturally,

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:24.225 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be in a cul-de-sac
at the level of culture.

01:02:24.225 --> 01:02:25.360 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.385 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to know at
this point for a lot of people,

01:02:28.385 --> 01:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
well, what is the
purpose of the--

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
what is the purpose of my life?

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:32.900 align:middle line:90%
If we have a--

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, I know you have
a young daughter.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
If I was to have a young child
today, what would you say?

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.461 align:middle line:84%
Well, you should-- the reason
for your life is so that you

01:02:40.461 --> 01:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
can make-- you get a good job
so you can make a lot of money

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
so you can give your
kid a good education

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.722 align:middle line:84%
so, when he or she grows
up, they can, you know,

01:02:48.722 --> 01:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
they can get a good
education, they

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
can get married and give their
kids a good-- Is that why

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.290 align:middle line:90%
we're here?

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:53.831 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So when we realize that
the evolutionary process is now

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.577 align:middle line:84%
really dependent upon us, and
it's not happening consciously,

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that the future is going to
be determined by the actions

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.820 align:middle line:90%
we take and the choices we make.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.005 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about our lives
and when we think about choices

01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and we think about
what we're doing,

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
does it relate to the
unmanifested potential

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.170 align:middle line:90%
that there is in the future?

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Do we-- do we see
that we could be

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.876 align:middle line:84%
catalysts to new potentials
and new possibilities

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
for human beings at the
level of culture that

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist before?

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Do we imagine?

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the capacity
to imagine and relate

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.324 align:middle line:84%
to life with that
big a perspective?

01:03:28.324 --> 01:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what I'm
trying to get people to do.

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is
very important, yes.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Because my nine-year-old ask
me, what is my purpose in life?

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She was just kicking the
soccer ball around asking,

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.760 align:middle line:90%
what is my purpose?

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is such an
important question to ask

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: What did tell her?

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I said, to help others.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
That's ultimately
what I-- I'm going

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to model through my purpose.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And my purpose here is
to impart information,

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to help people get to this
next state of evolution

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.519 align:middle line:84%
in their practical
everyday lives.

01:03:57.519 --> 01:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I bring it down to
a practical level.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But think about
teenagers and adolescents

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that are hitting that age where
there's the rites of passage

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
are gone.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's not so much
of a ceremony or tradition

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
around any longer into
this modern tradition,

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.110 align:middle line:90%
modern society, that we're in.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:14.240 align:middle line:90%
All of that's disappeared.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So how do you teach
this evolution,

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
modern practical evolution, to
a nine-year-old, to a teenager,

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
to a 30-year-old?

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, what we need to
do for children and adults is

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to awaken them, to point out to
everybody that, hey, everybody,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
we are all products of a cosmic
process that's going somewhere.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And human beings are the eyes
and the ears and the heart

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.782 align:middle line:84%
and the mind of the
cosmos, of this process

01:04:41.782 --> 01:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
that's going somewhere.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.406 align:middle line:84%
That there-- We realize
now that there's

01:04:44.406 --> 01:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as some
kind of spiritual being

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that exists outside the process
that's somehow affecting change

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
in the process, that the energy
and intelligence that gave

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
rise to the creative process,
the energy and intelligence

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that created the universe
and is creating the universe

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.650 align:middle line:90%
is inherent in the process.

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
That energy and intelligence
is awakening to itself in us

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
when we realize,
oh, my goodness,

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.255 align:middle line:84%
I am the cosmos awakening
to itself in human form.

01:05:09.255 --> 01:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, when
we look at the future,

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
it's we are the energy
and intelligence that

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.009 align:middle line:84%
created the universe awakening
to what we've created

01:05:17.009 --> 01:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and looking towards the future.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.716 align:middle line:84%
And then we realize,
this is mine.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
When you asked me before
about non duality--

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary non
duality means I am,

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you are, that singular
energy and intelligence

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that chose to take
that leap from nothing

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to something, from
being to becoming,

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:32.876 align:middle line:90%
from formlessness to form.

01:05:32.876 --> 01:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Because before the universe was
created, there was only one,

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.610 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning,
when you see

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that this is one
creative process,

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
that the creative motive in
the universe is a singularity,

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.957 align:middle line:84%
and when you experience
the creative motivation

01:05:49.957 --> 01:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, you
experience what I experience,

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.690 align:middle line:90%
which is ecstasy and urgency.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Ecstasy and urgency
is the experience

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.915 align:middle line:90%
of the evolutionary impulse.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so interesting
coming from someone like you.

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But do you recommend
to other people

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:05.960 align:middle line:84%
seeking spiritual teachers,
seeking outside themselves

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
for this sense of
enlightenment if you're

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
saying that that
all is within us?

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Then it begs the question
of religion and morality.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we look inside
ourselves for that?

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I got to ask you.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.426 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, no, sure.

01:06:19.426 --> 01:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, when we want to
learn about anything that we

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
don't know a lot about, we
tend to look for guidance

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
from individuals that have a
lot more experience than we do.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So we want to learn
about physics.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.550 align:middle line:90%
We might read about physics.

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And we might go
to somebody who's

01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:35.360 align:middle line:90%
a master of the discipline.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And so internal development
and internal evolution

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
is also-- some
people have journeyed

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot farther in terms of
eternal-- internal evolution

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:45.780 align:middle line:90%
development than others.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And so historically, when
someone has wanted to evolve

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
internally, they've sought out
the guidance and the direction

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of individuals that have gone
a lot farther than they have,

01:06:55.890 --> 01:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that have demonstrated that they
seem to have access to a level

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
of depth of
consciousness, cognition,

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and understanding and higher
development that a lot of other

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%
people don't.

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And so historically,
human beings

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
have sought the
guidance of other people

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that have gone farther
than they have.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the spiritual journey
is the journey from the gross

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
to the subtle, and so-- and
then from the subtle to the more

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
subtle and the subtle
to the even more subtle.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So there are rare individuals
that have awakened completely

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
on their own without any
help or guidance whatsoever.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're the exception
rather than the rule.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
remember, we live

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in the me culture
and the I culture.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is nobody
tells me what to do.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there-- In
the narcissism there

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
is-- if I'm permitted to
say such a thing-- there's

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the arrogance of
already knowing.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I think I already
know everything.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we want
to develop spiritually,

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
we have to be able to
cultivate humility.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
willing to understand

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.429 align:middle line:84%
there's an enormous
amount that we don't know.

01:07:54.429 --> 01:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well there has
been a drifting away

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.404 align:middle line:84%
from organized
religion as a society.

01:07:58.404 --> 01:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
organized religion.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.236 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
talking about is--

01:08:01.236 --> 01:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
are the traditional
religious paths.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.060 align:middle line:90%


01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the issue there
is because they're

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
based upon-- they're
mythical traditions.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They're based upon
great myths that

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
with the Western enlightenment,
with the birth of science,

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
there was a recognition that,
you know, some of these--

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.898 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't make sense.

01:08:19.898 --> 01:08:21.689 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, yeah,
some of the assertions

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
of the great traditions
just aren't true.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what's important
now is that we

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:33.550 align:middle line:84%
embrace a rational spirituality
and a rational mysticism,

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:38.509 align:middle line:84%
one that will not
contradict science,

01:08:38.509 --> 01:08:40.790 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to be accepted
at a level of culture.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where your
teachings and understanding

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:49.189 align:middle line:84%
more about evolution and
enlightenment come into play.

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And you teach-- there's
five tenants that you teach

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
about getting people-- if
you're looking for those steps,

01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
or where to start now, or
a place to-- an entry point

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to get into what it means to
explore your own purpose here

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.521 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:06.979 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through some of those
that you teach in your book.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.688 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: OK, so
the first one has

01:09:08.688 --> 01:09:10.479 align:middle line:84%
to do with becoming
very clear about what's

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.029 align:middle line:84%
more important than
anything else in life.

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
the most important one.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's a question a lot of
people don't ask themselves.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:20.002 align:middle line:84%
They say, what do
I-- what is more

01:09:20.002 --> 01:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
important than anything else?

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:22.792 align:middle line:84%
Based on my own life
experience, what

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
have I realized is more
important than anything else,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.569 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:27.649 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So getting clear
about something that's

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
more important than
anything in life.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The clarity itself is
what you're talking about.

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: What's going to
become the focal point?

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
What is it that we're
going to organize

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
everything else in
our life around?

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.910 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people drift.

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are just drifting

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.504 align:middle line:84%
through sexual
relationships and jobs--

01:09:42.504 --> 01:09:43.842 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --without an intention.

01:09:43.842 --> 01:09:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --and hobbies.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
You say, well, that's cool.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.344 align:middle line:84%
But what's the
bigger picture here?

01:09:48.344 --> 01:09:49.910 align:middle line:90%
What's your compass?

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:51.240 align:middle line:90%
What's your pole star?

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
What's the North Star?

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
well, I don't really know.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So the clarity of
intention here is

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
becoming very clear about
some big meta perspective.

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.554 align:middle line:84%
What's more important
than anything else?

01:10:01.554 --> 01:10:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is yours?

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, for me, the
evolution of the-- what

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Ken Wilber, the great
American philosopher,

01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
calls the interior
of the cosmos.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of the
interior of the universe

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
is what my life is
completely dedicated to.

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:26.055 align:middle line:84%
And I'm completely
committed to emergence.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.170 align:middle line:90%


01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Emergence is when something that
never existed before suddenly

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.580 align:middle line:90%
appears, right?

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I am committed
through the work

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing to leave
in my wake emergent

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
potentials in
consciousness and culture

01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that didn't exist before.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very kind
of bold aspiration.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And the whole-- this whole
notion of emergence, I think,

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is very key to giving the
luckiest people that have ever

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
been born a sense of purpose.

01:10:55.310 --> 01:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Because these emergent leaps
are all about-- evolution

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.330 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you say-- well, there's--
one writer recently said there

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
was not one big bang,
but three big bangs.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is how
did energy and matter

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
emerge from primordial
emptiness, no-thing-ness?

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.810 align:middle line:90%
That is a quantum leap.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example
of emergence.

01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
How did energy and matter
emerge from absolutely nothing

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever?

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The second big bang is
how does biological life

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
emerge from energy and
apparently dead matter?

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%


01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And the third big
bang is how does

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
mind-- how does
mind, interiority,

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and mind in culture
emerge from life?

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And so those are examples
of these three big bangs,

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
or these three leaps in
the creative process,

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.720 align:middle line:84%
these extraordinary leaps
that defy our understanding.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
These are leaps
that are-- they're

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
quantum leaps in complexity, in
developmental and evolutionary

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
complexity, that are
ultimately mysterious.

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
reali-- when we look

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
back from where we are
to see where we came from

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and we see that we're
a product of emergence,

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that we are emergence
in progress,

01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:13.502 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that the
future of the evolution

01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which
is going to happen

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
at the level of culture,
is going to depend upon you

01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:22.681 align:middle line:84%
and me, we're going to need
to assume a relationship

01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to the human
experience that's going

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to make it possible
for creative leaps

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.641 align:middle line:90%
forward to happen through us.

01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So that is your big,
very big intention.

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:32.190 align:middle line:90%


01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's an inherently
creative relationship

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to existence that's not just
about me becoming, learning how

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to paint or learning
how to write.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:41.871 align:middle line:84%
It's not only about my
own self actualization.

01:12:41.871 --> 01:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about the evolution of
the interior of the cosmos

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:44.990 align:middle line:90%
through me.

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And to me, when you get--
when we get this idea,

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the most exciting,
inspiring, thrilling

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
recognition of who I am and what
the purpose of existence is.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that takes you
to the second tenant, which

01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:59.155 align:middle line:84%
is that power of volition
to get you to that place.

01:12:59.155 --> 01:12:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So the first one, then, so then
my intention-- my intention

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.449 align:middle line:84%
then becomes, really, the
evolution of the interior

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the
evolution of the cosmos,

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.640 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of the world.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.747 align:middle line:84%
And my reason for existence
is for the evolution

01:13:12.747 --> 01:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of the world through
me, the evolution

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.246 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness
and culture through me,

01:13:16.246 --> 01:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
which is the evolution
of the cosmos.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.815 align:middle line:84%
So that shift means, if
you take that seriously,

01:13:20.815 --> 01:13:23.876 align:middle line:84%
if one takes that seriously,
it completely compels

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:26.250 align:middle line:84%
you to transcend the fears
and desires of the small self,

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
the small ego, which
is really worried

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:28.910 align:middle line:90%
about me and my little life.

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where the stress
is, where the stress is.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.136 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And suddlenly,
you're realizing, wow,

01:13:32.136 --> 01:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
this is about living the biggest
life possible for the biggest

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:35.630 align:middle line:90%
reason.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the first
tenant's all about.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
most important one.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.068 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It chunks up,
and it gets you out

01:13:40.068 --> 01:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of your current
level of reality.

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well you start
living big, you know?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You start living a big
life, not a small life.

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:47.612 align:middle line:90%
And that takes guts.

01:13:47.612 --> 01:13:48.320 align:middle line:90%
It takes courage.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.195 align:middle line:90%
It takes inspiration.

01:13:49.195 --> 01:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%


01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The law of volitionality
is all about choice.

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It basically says that we
have to transcend the victim

01:13:58.450 --> 01:13:58.950 align:middle line:90%
position.

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to get over it
radically, unconditionally,

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:03.220 align:middle line:90%
once and for all and forever.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.102 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, we
have to take responsibility

01:14:06.102 --> 01:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
for the consequences
of everything that's

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:08.660 align:middle line:90%
ever happened to us.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We've all been hurt,
wounded, traumatized,

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
victimized in some
way or shape or form.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Life is a bumpy ride, like
we were saying before.

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's full of nicks,
bruises, and scratches.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.554 align:middle line:84%
And instead of feeling resentful
and blaming other people,

01:14:20.554 --> 01:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we have to realize
that, you know,

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.444 align:middle line:84%
life is full of-- everybody's
doing the best they can.

01:14:24.444 --> 01:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Life is full of ignorance
and unconsciousness.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.401 align:middle line:90%
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And people made mistakes.

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I suffered.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:29.930 align:middle line:90%
You suffered.

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Other people have suffered.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The consequences of
all that's my problem.

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:35.530 align:middle line:90%
It's nobody else's problem.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
My karmic predicament is
my own karmic predicament.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.465 align:middle line:84%
I blame no one for my own
circumstances, number one.

01:14:40.465 --> 01:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And the law of volitionality
says that I also

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
have to take responsibility
for all of my own choices.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
My life is my own problem
and my own solution.

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I take unconditional
responsibility for the choices

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:50.800 align:middle line:90%
that I make.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I blame no one else for
my life circumstances,

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and I take full
responsibility for my failures

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and my victories.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all me.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.525 align:middle line:84%
And so this is fully
empowering, you know?

01:15:01.525 --> 01:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This is how we get
to a point of sel--

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.675 align:middle line:84%
It points us in the
direction of self mastery

01:15:05.675 --> 01:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
because we take a radi--
There's a radical sense

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:11.751 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility we take for
the totality of our condition.

01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would've
never gotten that

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
from the words, the
power of volition,

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
until you just
explained it that way.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Because volition really takes
you into a forward place,

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
momentum, moving forward,
rather than getting stuck.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, no,
but it also means,

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
once we take responsibility
for all that,

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.160 align:middle line:84%
we want to make the right
choices for the right reasons.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So if I say the most
important thing is

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
consciousness and culture,

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
then that would mean that
the big choices that I

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
make in relationship
to life should

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.460 align:middle line:84%
be expressions of
that big intention.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.810 align:middle line:90%


01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:42.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:45.086 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Then my choices
would be expressions

01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of that which I said
is most important.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then once you have
found out your intention

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and then move through with
the power of volition,

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
then you get into
the third tenant.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, OK, so the
third one, the third tenant

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is what I believe
is the ultimate form

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:01.960 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual practice.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And all mystical schools point
to the practice of awareness.

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
That's really-- All schools,
enlightenment schools

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
or mystical schools, tell us
that it's all about cultivating

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.290 align:middle line:90%
the capacity for awareness.

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So the third tenet
says, if you want

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to become an
enlightened human being,

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
if you are to be so bold as
to declare that you are going

01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to actualize the
evolution of the interior

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.467 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, you
have to make sure

01:16:28.467 --> 01:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're no longer
going to be acting out

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of unconscious motives.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to become an infinitely
more conscious person.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So the way you
become conscious is

01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
by paying a lot more attention
to what you're doing.

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's the
awareness of facing everything.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, when you face
everything and avoid nothing--

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.359 align:middle line:84%
because often, the
left hand doesn't

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
know what the right hand
is doing for many of us.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
We say one thing.

01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:49.060 align:middle line:90%
We do another.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how did I end
up in this situation again

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:52.170 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
When I thought I was going
here, I ended up there.

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And the question is because the
self is fundamentally divided,

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.440 align:middle line:90%
consciously and unconsciously.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
We're divided against ourselves.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
here is when you get

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:06.575 align:middle line:84%
behind this primary intention,
which is the first tenant,

01:17:06.575 --> 01:17:10.064 align:middle line:84%
you can unify yourself
around one motive, right?

01:17:10.064 --> 01:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when you take
responsibility for all of it,

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you can take responsibility
around this one motive.

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And then how you
stay on track is

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.746 align:middle line:84%
you start paying more
attention than most people do

01:17:21.746 --> 01:17:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to what you're doing
and why you're doing it.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.769 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize your
choices are important,

01:17:25.769 --> 01:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
to have consequences.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.876 align:middle line:84%
And if you care, not
just about yourself

01:17:29.876 --> 01:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and your own happiness, but
the evolution of the interior

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:33.916 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the
evolution of culture,

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
the world, you have

01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you
don't make big mistakes

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.386 align:middle line:84%
and that your choices
are a clear expression

01:17:40.386 --> 01:17:41.510 align:middle line:90%
of your highest intentions.

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that,
there has to be a greater

01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:45.645 align:middle line:84%
degree of awareness
that we bring

01:17:45.645 --> 01:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
to every single moment, not just
the moments when we're sitting

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
in meditation, but
the-- We always

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
have to be paying attention
to what am I doing?

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How are
we in relationship

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to what we're doing?

01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah, what am I
doing, and why am I doing it?

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we all--
we're all crazy.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.027 align:middle line:90%
The conditioned mind is crazy.

01:18:02.027 --> 01:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you mean
by that, we're all crazy?

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, because--
because if you-- all any of us

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
has to do is just monitor
the wandering mind.

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:13.145 align:middle line:90%
And we're all full of crazy--

01:18:13.145 --> 01:18:14.092 align:middle line:90%


01:18:14.092 --> 01:18:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thoughts.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --the crazy thoughts,
crazy desires, crazy fears,

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
ambitions.

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where does that
stem from, the egoic mind?

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it stems from
our biological instincts

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
compel us to have-- compel us
in certain directions, which

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is-- you know, which
is-- there is--

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
we have-- at least
men, especially,

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
have an unending
sexual aspiration,

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.000 align:middle line:90%
which stems from biology.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's one level which,
from a purely rational point

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.730 align:middle line:84%
of view, seems a

feelings of unworthiness.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.250 align:middle line:84%

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.235 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I mean, these
all come from childhood neuroses

01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and from-- And it's also
another cultural epidemic.

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.750 align:middle line:90%
So many people feel unworthy.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.666 align:middle line:84%
The luckiest people that
have ever been born--

01:19:11.666 --> 01:19:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and you have to appreciate the
irony of the luckiest people

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that have been born feeling not
good enough, feeling unworthy.

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a
lot that in my own life,

01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
as so many other
people have done.

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Then there can be unwholesome
people, the competitiveness,

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
a lack of compassion, a lack
of sympathy with other people,

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:30.800 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this stuff.

this is all part of
the human experience.

01:19:34.175 --> 01:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, we
want to get to the point

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.045 align:middle line:84%
where we're so awake
to our higher impulses

01:19:38.045 --> 01:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to bear
witness to this stuff

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.860 align:middle line:90%
without acting out of it.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you observe it.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:45.330 align:middle line:90%

>>COHEN: But don't
act out of it.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea
is we don't want

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.082 align:middle line:84%
to start acting out of this
stuff in such a way that's

01:19:51.082 --> 01:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%

consequences in the real world.

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to suffer.

01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
We and other people

01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to suffer the consequences.

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then that gets us
to the fourth tenant, which is--

01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But that third
one, the face everything,

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
is very-- it's challenging.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate practice
to face everything

01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:04.743 align:middle line:90%
without avoiding it.

01:20:04.743 --> 01:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I understand

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.831 align:middle line:84%

a little while.

01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The practice of
deep and profound awareness--

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.496 align:middle line:84%
the fourth one
we've been speaking

01:20:11.496 --> 01:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
about quite a bit
together today.

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
process perspective.

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's realizing--
that's realizing

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that I am and you are
and we all are products

01:20:22.090 --> 01:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of a cosmic process that
had a beginning in time

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
14 billion years
ago and that we--

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that there was this big cosmic
explosion of energy and matter

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that gave rise to life, that
gave rise to mind, that gave

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
rise to culture, that gave
rise to this body, this mind,

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and this personality-- is
an inseparable part this one

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:43.210 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And so then we begin
to see everything

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.862 align:middle line:84%
I experience in
ter-- everything I

01:20:46.862 --> 01:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
experience at the
level of biology,

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.099 align:middle line:84%
my physical experience,
my biological experience,

01:20:51.099 --> 01:20:53.265 align:middle line:84%
my psychological experience,
my personal experience,

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that everything happen--
my spiritual experience.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything we
experience internally

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and everything we see externally
that's happening in the world

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is all part and parcel
of this one process.

01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:06.562 align:middle line:84%
It's all one process
that's unfolding.

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So we see everything
from the perspective

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:10.150 align:middle line:90%
of this one process.

01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't see just
discrete events.

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:13.275 align:middle line:90%
My life is not a discrete--

01:21:13.275 --> 01:21:14.685 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the non duality.

01:21:14.685 --> 01:21:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:16.893 align:middle line:84%
In Mahayana Buddhism,
they have what's

01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:18.320 align:middle line:90%
called dependent origination.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the similar idea
that everything exists--

01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that exists depends upon
everything else that exists,

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.180 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything is dependent
upon everything else.

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the unenlightened
perspective

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is the false-- is
imagining falsely

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that I am a discrete event,
you're a discrete event.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.364 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
discreet about these events.

01:21:37.364 --> 01:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
These-- We're-- Everything is
intermingled with everything

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:40.280 align:middle line:90%

>>COHEN: --cosmic conscience.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, cosmic conscience
relates to this.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because what-- if live in the
world of your personal ego,

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:59.887 align:middle line:84%
your fears and your desires
relate to yourself personally.

01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And everything's about me.

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:01.590 align:middle line:90%
What's good for me?

01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:02.330 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:03.540 align:middle line:90%
What am I afraid of?

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

But when you have-- when
you awaken to evolution

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that my ego is
just a small part of who I am,

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.960 align:middle line:84%
when you grasp that, experience
that at a very deep level,

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
you begin to feel a sense

about where we're all going.

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%

01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:41.157 align:middle line:84%

We suddenly care desperately

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: That's what
I'm talking about.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely, yes.

01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a chunking up,
basically, to our--

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And so people will be
called to do things

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
like help children
in Afghanistan

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:40.225 align:middle line:84%
or going to different
areas to be of service.

01:24:40.225 --> 01:24:41.315 align:middle line:90%


01:24:41.315 --> 01:24:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: But not only that.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.523 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important
distinction you're making.

01:24:44.523 --> 01:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Because traditionally,
in, for example,

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in Christianity-- and
Christians really, I think,

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of all the traditions, have done
better at this than anybody.

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're a good Christian, you
express your love for Christ

01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:57.486 align:middle line:90%
through loving your neighbor.

01:24:57.486 --> 01:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to see
more Christians in Afghanistan

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and in Haiti and other
places than you're

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.400 align:middle line:84%
going to see Buddhists
or Hindus or Jews

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
or anybody else,
interestingly enough.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But also the-- in
Buddhism there's

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a whole notion in Mahayana
Buddhism of compassion.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, compassion,
or the selfle-- or healing

01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the wounds of existence,
become the expression

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment in the world.

01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:24.537 align:middle line:84%
And that's
traditionally been true.

01:25:24.537 --> 01:25:25.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's still true.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The biggest gurus in India
now do enormous amounts

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.659 align:middle line:90%
of social work.

01:25:29.659 --> 01:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Physically, not
just meditating about it,

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.324 align:middle line:90%
but physically.

01:25:32.324 --> 01:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, no, well they
medi-- but their movements have

01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
systems in place that do
enormous amounts of social work

01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:39.730 align:middle line:90%
that uplift the poor.

01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So-- But what I--
But the whole notion

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to help in an
evolutionary context shifts.

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're talking
about is healing woundedness

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and healing the
very real-- dealing

01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
with very many real problems
that we have in the world.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.537 align:middle line:84%
But there's another issue here,
which is where we're going.

01:25:56.537 --> 01:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to
have our attention

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
on that, which is giving
rise, as I've been saying,

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to potentials and
possibilities and capacities

01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
that don't exist yet.

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not-- So the future
is not only about healing.

01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
There's another emerging
expression of compassion

01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
which is all about creating
that which doesn't exist yet.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.366 align:middle line:90%


01:26:17.366 --> 01:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That right
there can be applied

01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:20.390 align:middle line:90%
to every area of your life.

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
That could be
applied to parenting.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
That could be applied to
your vocation in life.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
That could be applied
to your relationship.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
It's giving existence
to something

01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't exist
yet and creating

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:33.917 align:middle line:84%
from that space is a very
powerful place to be.

01:26:33.917 --> 01:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, yeah.

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the
thing is that, Lisa,

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that culture are shared
agreements and shared values.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So what culture doesn't
exist out there;

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
it exists-- When we agree about
what's most important in life

01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:50.624 align:middle line:84%
and about what's real, we
create culture together.

01:26:50.624 --> 01:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we talk about
creating the future,

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we're actually talking about
creating new shared agreements,

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.710 align:middle line:90%
creating new values.

01:26:56.710 --> 01:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
culture is going

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:58.930 align:middle line:90%
to look like in the future.

01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's work that's
very urgent that we need.

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.589 align:middle line:90%
Because where are we going?

01:27:03.589 --> 01:27:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is talking about
technology, of course,

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:08.345 align:middle line:84%
as leading the w-- as
shaping culture now

01:27:08.345 --> 01:27:12.514 align:middle line:84%
and having a very big effect on
the way we're relating to life

01:27:12.514 --> 01:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
or the way we're
relating to each other.

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But technology is merely
the ways and means

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.950 align:middle line:84%
in which we're
sharing information.

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
affect our values.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:21.990 align:middle line:90%


01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't affect
our shared agreements

01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
about what's important.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unless we can infuse
our values into the technology.

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: The new values.

01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:30.235 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
create them first.

01:27:30.235 --> 01:27:33.075 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- That's
the big work at hand.

01:27:33.075 --> 01:27:34.470 align:middle line:90%


01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:36.310 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
really creating culture.

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:38.134 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or there could
be a lack of that.

01:27:38.134 --> 01:27:39.050 align:middle line:90%
There could be a lack.

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: There is a lack of it.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There could
be a lack of values

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
going into the internet
and a lack of culture.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, no.

01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I think there are--
the values that

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
are there are what has
already been there.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:56.056 align:middle line:84%
But what we're talking about
creating new values based

01:27:56.056 --> 01:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
upon some of these
big ideas that we've

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
that are going

01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to help to shape
what human life is

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.324 align:middle line:84%
going to look like
in the future.

01:28:01.324 --> 01:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
unless we consciously

01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:05.907 align:middle line:84%
do that, we're just
going to be taken

01:28:05.907 --> 01:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
by the speed of
information, and we're

01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.323 align:middle line:84%
going to be more and
more overwhelmed by it.

01:28:09.323 --> 01:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And we want to become,
in a sense, not

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:12.980 align:middle line:90%
masters of our own destiny only.

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But we want to become masters
of our collective destiny.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the big spiritual
challenge for us at hand

01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:19.290 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean that, to me, is
really the biggest question.

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have done a great job

01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of guiding us to
ask those deeper questions

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and, really, to get us to
a place of possibilities

01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and potentials that can,
again, be created out of-- out

01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
of this conversation right here.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.830 align:middle line:90%

01:28:38.670 --> 01:28:39.990 align:middle line:90%
