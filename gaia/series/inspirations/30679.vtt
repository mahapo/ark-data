00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:10%
Inspirations," coming to you
from our beautiful Los Angeles

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:10%
studio.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:10%
So what would it
be like if we could

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
all work together in the name
of consciousness and community?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:10%
What would it be like if we
really knew the deep meaning

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:10%
of oneness, and we approached
our lives from that perspective

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
all the time?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, these are the views
and the mission of the award

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
winning producer director Mikki
Willis, founder of Elevate,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:10%
a transformational
company designed

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:10%
for socially conscious media.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to the show, Mikki.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for being here

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for having me.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you have an amazing story of
how you came about all of this.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:10%
What was the kind of
pivotal moment in your life

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:10%
that really got you
started on your path?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, the full story
really was that in 2000,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:10%
I directed my
first feature film.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:10%
And I was in New York
working out a distribution

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:10%
deal for that film.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:90%
So you already were in media.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I've been in media
for quite a while.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
I was in front of the camera.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I was an actor, and
then an acting teacher

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:90%
From a pretty young age, yeah.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And then I started directing.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I had a theater just
right around the corner

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
here, in Los Angeles,
that I directed and built

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.876 align:middle line:90%
when I was 23 years old.

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:34.875 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, you're kidding!

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was a really,
really incredible experience.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:90%
In NoHo.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
In North Hollywood.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I found myself,
in 2000, finishing up

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:90%
my first feature film.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2001, by the
time that it was completely

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
finished, we were
traveling around

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:90%
to secure a distribution deal.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And that led me to New York.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, I
had a meeting on 9/10/2001.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:90%
You can kind of--

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: September 10, 2001.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%
---imagine what was coming up.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the World Trade
Center for the first time

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:90%
as a tourist on 9/10.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Now this was after a friend
of mine, a producer friend

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of mine-- we had dinner
on 9/9, and suddenly

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
found out that I
had never visited

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:90%
the World Trade Center before.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And he became totally
obsessed with having

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
me go to the World Trade
Center before I left New York.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I was scheduled to
fly out on 9/11.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So much that it literally
ruined the dinner.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's all
he would talk about.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:10%
He wrote down a map of
what subway to take.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:10%
And he was just completely one
track mind, the whole time.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Not even listening or having
fun with any of the stories,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
but just kept reminding
me all dinner--

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
are you really going to go?

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to go see
the World Trade Center?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Really?
-Yeah.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: How bizarre.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally said,
Doug, why do you care if I

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:90%
go to the World Trade Center?

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And he said one of the
most bizarre things

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:10%
that, now in retrospect, that
I can imagine him saying,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:10%
which was, he said, go up and
look at the view from the top

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and do the tourist thing.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty extraordinary.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to look at the
buildings from the ground.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to
just understand

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:10%
what an incredible monolithic
structure this is, built

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:10%
by man, and what a joke it
was that they tried to take

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:10%
them down a few years ago.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
This is what he said to me.
This was his exact words.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if you remember,
there was a bomb

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that had gone off in the
basement of the World Trade

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Center a few years before.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just started-- I
laughed, and I said, why

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:90%
do you want me to-- OK, Doug.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Would you have to change your
flight in order to do that?

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:10%
No, I was scheduled to
head to fly out about one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:10%
o'clock that day, on the 11th.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so as a tourist, I went
to the World Trade Center,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and then I stood at the bottom,
and I took a picture of me

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
just to prove to
Doug that I actually

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:84%
went to see this
incredible spectacle that

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:90%
was the World Trade Center.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
I was actually

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
staying at Doug's house.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:10%
The next morning, he woke me
up by slapping me on the foot.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my eyes,
and I looked at him.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And he was just pale white.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, wow.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And he was pointing to the TV,
which he had just turned on.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:10%
So it was just turning on.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:10%
And he said, they bombed us.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:10%
They bombed us.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm thinking,
wait a second here.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Doug produces the Howard Stern
Show, which I didn't mention.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Howard Stern is a
big practical joker.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:10%
Doug wanted me to go into
the World Trade Center,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:10%
would they be doing
something crazy like this.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:10%
And so I said, I need proof.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:10%
Let's go on the roof.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:10%
Went to the roof
of his building,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.251 align:middle line:10%
and we could look at it
and see what was happening.

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh my god.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, to
make a long story shorter,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:10%
I said, I have to go down there.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:10%
How did you say that?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, most people
would have run--

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:10%
and most people did-- run
the opposite direction.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, I think
a lot of people

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:10%
would have done what we did.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's pretty much
what caused my awakening,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:10%
was to see how the human spirit
really reacts under something

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.757 align:middle line:10%
that's so much bigger than
all of our-- the stuff

00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:10%
that we're trapped in.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:10%
The identities,
and the addictions,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:10%
and all the stuff that
we think is important,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:10%
that when you have an
experience like that,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:10%
you realign with reality
in a new way, such

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:10%
that you start to really focus
on what's really important,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:10%
which is our relationships,
and our families,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:10%
and that's the only stuff
that really counts, right?

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, we went down.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:10%
Doug said, I was just
thinking the same thing.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And we went down to Ground Zero.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And he had these media
badges that just confused

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the authorities that were trying
to figure out who belongs there

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and who doesn't belong there.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.491 align:middle line:10%
And they looked at our badges
and went, oh, OK, come on,

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:10%
come on in.
Do your thing.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:10%
And so we spent 72 hours
first, feeding firefighters

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:10%
and washing out their
eyes, and taking care

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:10%
of all of the rescue squads.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:10%
And then, when the
Red Cross came in,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:10%
they allowed us to suit up and
to continue doing the search

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:10%
and rescue efforts
and body recovery.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:10%
It didn't-- wow.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:10%
It didn't matter who
or where you came.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:10%
If you were willing
to help, you were--

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS:
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:10%
Oh my goodness.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:10%
And what happened for me,
in that experience-- up

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:10%
until that point, I could say
that I was pursuing a pretty

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:10%
ordinary path, which
was, I was in Hollywood,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:10%
and I was working
very hard to make it.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And making it means trying to--
whatever it takes to get there,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:10%
even if that means
trampling on someone else,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:10%
or your fellow filmmakers.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you really
want to be on top.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was a part of
me that had that drive,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%
that drive to be the best.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very selfish
pursuit, actually.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened to me
was, after our first 50 hours

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
or so of being in
this experience--

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Wait, dive into
that for a second.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.801 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're in--
you're recovering bodies.

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.
That's right.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:10%
What was that like for you?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is
obviously something

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:10%
you've never done before.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
You were picking up
bodies out of the rubble

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and bringing them into an area?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were-- it was kind
of a chain gang of people.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:10%
So we would pass them down,
and they would be put into body

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:10%
bags and taken to the morgue.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And so as you can
imagine, it's-- not

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to downplay it at all.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:10%
It was an extraordinary
experience, and one that,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:10%
when we were finally
told to go take a nap,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:10%
because everyone had been
up for a couple of days.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And the people that had finally
taken charge of the area

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:10%
were aware that it was dangerous
to have anyone sleep deprived,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:10%
working around heavy machinery.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:10%
And so I went to take my
first nap in two days or so,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:10%
and I had a nightmare.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I probably was sleeping
for five minutes,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.771 align:middle line:84%
and I had a flashback, a
nightmare of the first body

00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that we found.
-Of course, that's traumatic.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I woke up,
and my heart was racing.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up, and
my heart was racing.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:10%
And the words came through
me that kind of startled me.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And that was just this voice
came out of nowhere that said,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:10%
this could be your Vietnam, or--
and it just left me hanging.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, wow,
what does that mean?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: There's "or."

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:10%
And I sat there for a little
while, and I thought, oh wow.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:10%
My experience of
Vietnam vets had

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:10%
been that the ones
that I had witnessed

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:10%
were on street
corners with signs.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, had I
experienced too much already?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:10%
Does this damage my physical
body somehow, that I will

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:10%
never be able to recover from?

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:10%
Like, should I be here?

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I shouldn't be
doing what I'm doing here.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I said, so
what's the "or"?

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
So that's one possible choice,
but what's the "or" mean?

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And so now my whole
system is racing,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:10%
and I just decided,
I can't sleep,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to go back
out into the rubble,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to find
out what that means.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And as I rounded the corner,
by the time I was taking a nap,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:10%
they had erected a new
football stadium lighting

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:10%
that had been brought in.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm a cinematographer,
and I love light.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I rounded the corner,
and my first thought was,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:90%
like, wow, this is beautiful.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And then it just hit me.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:10%
I thought, I can't
say that about this.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Can I call this
situation beautiful?

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:10%
And I stopped just long
enough to consider that.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.265 align:middle line:10%
Can this be beautiful?

00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:22.065 align:middle line:10%
This is the most horrific
thing I've ever experienced.

00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:22.764 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:25.134 align:middle line:10%
But that moment got
expanded in your mind.

00:09:25.134 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Just by
asking myself that question,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:10%
is it OK for me to look at
this situation as beautiful?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:10%
It's anything but that.
-Right.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:10%
And I stood there,
and then I suddenly

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:10%
became aware of something
I hadn't thought of up

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:10%
until that point, which was,
the entire world right now, most

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:10%
of it, is thinking about
and focused on the very spot

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:10%
in which I'm standing.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, this idea
of this grand world,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:10%
this disconnected world,
I saw how possible

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:10%
it was for us all
to get connected

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:10%
on a singular thought, or
a moment, or a location,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:10%
by our awareness.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, how lucky I am
to be standing in this location

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:10%
where so many people would
love to be right now to help,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.259 align:middle line:10%
to be part of this.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:10%
And I somehow landed
here for some reason.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a
reason to destroy me.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:10%
So what's the other--
what can I make of this?

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.904 align:middle line:10%
Because you were still
standing at that point--

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: I was still there.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.136 align:middle line:10%
---and you're having
this epiphany.

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and instead of
cursing, like there

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:10%
was something dark
that led me there,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:10%
what could be the
bright side of it?

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:10%
Literally.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:10%
And just that thought alone,
that consideration of,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:10%
is that even possible,
brought tears to my eyes.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I started looking at
all the people, and I thought,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.761 align:middle line:84%
these people are
breathing asbestos.

00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They know it.
The reports went around.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We all heard it.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:10%
And they haven't slept.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I watched men and
women cry when we

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
were able to save a rescue dog.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:10%
They released,
because it was like,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:10%
oh, we were able
to save something.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Something.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, this
is the human spirit.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:10%
This is what we're about
when something so much

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:10%
bigger than our own
identities and egos

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:10%
and all that stuff happens--
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:10%
---that it forces us together
as one human organism,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:10%
in the name of something good.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:10%
And I just, in
that moment, I was

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:10%
clear that the rest of my life
was going to be about this.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to do my
best to never forget this.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Was going to be about that
moment, of that connection,

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:10%
that oneness, that feeling.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:10%
It's as if you're describing
a near death experience.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly
what it is, really.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Right, where all consciousness
is connected in one.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:10%
So at what point did
you realize that that

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:10%
was your mission in life?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how did you connect
all of that together?

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:10%
How long did you stay there?

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:10%
I was only there
for 72 hours, but it

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:10%
seemed like it was months.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Literally months.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:10%
But then I was stuck in
New York for a while.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.989 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:10%
They put us up, and gave
us a cell phone, and said,

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:10%
you can't leave for
another two weeks

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:10%
or so, that we were
kind of stuck there.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't really
occur fully to me

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:10%
for-- it started to unfold over
the course of the next year.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I came back to Hollywood
where I had been living.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I put everything
I had in storage.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:10%
And I went to live in a friend's
guest house in the Napa Valley.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:10%
And I had secured a
writing job to write

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:10%
a sequel to an iconic classic.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:10%
So it gave me money
to survive for a year,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:10%
and to really contemplate.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
There was part of me that
was rejecting my industry.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Because I had a very successful
career as a music video

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:10%
director, and I looked
back at that body of work

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:10%
that I had done, and I
was so clear that I can't

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:10%
sell these products anymore.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:10%
I can't support these
musicians or people

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:10%
that I don't necessarily
think are putting the best

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:10%
messages out in the world.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:10%
I can't degrade women
in these videos anymore.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:10%
I can't do any of this anymore.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:10%
And I don't want to represent
anything that's misinformation,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:10%
or that creates more fear and
disconnection in the world.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, what
do I do though?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where to
go in my industry--

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.726 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What do
I do instead, yeah.

00:13:21.726 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
---to actually serve
this higher purpose.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And it took me a year or two.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Because it hadn't been created.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It had been created, yeah.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:10%
And so it took me a
year to really create

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:10%
a game plan of how I would
reenter Hollywood and put

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:10%
really the bat signal out
in the sky for everyone else

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:10%
who was feeling the way
I felt, to say, let's

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:10%
come play together.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:10%
And that was really
how Elevate was born.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:10%
That's what created elevate.
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:10%
And so I want you to take
a look at this trailer

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:10%
to get an idea
from what the story

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:10%
and the founder of
this company created,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:10%
and what it looks like now.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this trailer.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:02.381 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:05.363 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:05.363 --> 00:16:22.538 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:23.237 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:10%
So after you created this
incredible company, or idea,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:10%
concept, when you came
back to Hollywood,

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:10%
did you encounter resistance?

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:10%
Did you encounter,
are you crazy?

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:10%
What are you thinking?

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:10%
There's no market for that.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:10%
Were you told there's no market
for consciousness in media?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, I kind of
knew at the time

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:10%
that there really
wasn't anything that

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:10%
was-- there were a lot of
channels that were attempting

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:10%
to go in that direction.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:10%
But the particular style that
I was into, none of those

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:10%
really spoke to me.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something that would
speak to the mainstream, that

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
was still sexy and edgy and cool
and hip and all of that stuff.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So you
brought in that.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't-- well, I
wouldn't take credit for it

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
myself, but I
certainly helped rally

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
some of the pioneers that were
also wanting the same thing.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And we came together, and we
created Elevate Film Festival.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
That was the-- so Elevate
Film Festival started first,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and then the film company
started after that?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
No, actually the film
company started first.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:10%
And I was supporting really the
work I was doing as a director,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:10%
as a filmmaker.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:10%
But after I came back into
Hollywood and decided,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:10%
it's really time to
bring-- I had experienced

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:10%
other communities, these counter
cultures that were also very,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:10%
very positive, that
were developing new ways

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:10%
to really live together.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:10%
New ways of collaborating
and not competing

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:10%
from company to company.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Different, you know, from
the Burning Man communities,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of other tribal
councils that were starting

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to bring in some
ancient modalities

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
into the modern
world of business.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And so within all of these
different organizations,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:10%
there are some really
extraordinary people with a lot

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:10%
of new techniques that
would allow for us

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:10%
to operate and to utilize
some of the standard industry

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood practices,
but to really not

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:10%
be at the mercy of the system.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:10%
So to answer your question,
no, I really didn't receive

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:10%
much resistance, you know.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:10%
It's a matter of
not trying to force

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:10%
or change the existing system.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Like Bucky Fuller
said something cool,

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that I'll try to slaughter it
if I really try to quote him.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:10%
But it was pretty much
along the lines of,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.487 align:middle line:10%
instead of trying to shut
down an existing system,

00:18:51.487 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:10%
just build something
over here that's

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:10%
so much better and
works so much better

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.241 align:middle line:10%
that people start to
get attracted to that.

00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Right?
I slaughtered that, I know.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:10%
That's what you did, though.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:10%
But that was really
the method of,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:10%
let's just create
something that's

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:10%
so fun, that feels so much
better and so much more

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:10%
fulfilling to be
part of, that people

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:10%
will start to migrate over.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.294 align:middle line:90%
And that's what--

00:19:10.294 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's what the
festival became, right?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
festival became.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:90%
So what was the festival?

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:10%
Explain that.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.985 align:middle line:10%
Because it was a
great, great concept.

00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:10%
A lot of fun.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Thank
you, thank you.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:10%
That's how we met.
-Yes.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Really.
-It is, yes.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:10%
And it goes beyond.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you a story in a sec.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:10%
So you asked people, in a
way, of kind of an award

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:10%
show type of feel, right?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.731 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it was an
international challenge.

00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Challenge.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:10%
And it really
came from a desire

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:10%
to find out what's
right with the world.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:10%
Because when I came
back, I was kind of glued

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:10%
to the television,
because I wanted

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:10%
to watch all the reports that
were happening around 9/11.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:10%
And there was so
much misinformation.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Having been there, there were a
lot of things that had come up,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:10%
that suddenly became "truth"
through the mainstream news--

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's interesting.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:10%
---that was not really
the way it went down.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:10%
And so I thought,
wow, how interesting

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:10%
that is, that a
rumor gets started,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:10%
and every station
just adapts to that

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:10%
and starts to parrot
that information,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:10%
when it has no grounds
in reality whatsoever.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Like what
was an example of that?

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh, just time frames
of when things happened,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and when the Red Cross
came in, and who did what,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and all of that,
which was not the way

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:90%
we remember it happening.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And so there was really
this feeling inside,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:10%
of like-- and also, more focus
on the war against terror

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:10%
than the heroes, the amazing
humans that were there, doing

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:10%
extraordinary feats of heroism.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't seeing
enough of that

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:10%
on television to really see
how neighborhoods in New York

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:10%
were coming together.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was extraordinary, and
it was beautiful, actually.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this sense
of really wanting to find out

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:90%
what's right with the world.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the network news shows
humanity at its worst, really.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: What's wrong.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.279 align:middle line:84%
Right.
And the fear.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:10%
It does feed very fast.
It's like a frenzy.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: It
really is, yeah.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.324 align:middle line:10%
So it was really a call
to say to filmmakers

00:21:05.324 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, show us
what's right with the world.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:10%
What's right with your
community or your culture?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
What is a stereotype that
needs to be broken that you can

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:90%
give us another viewpoint of?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And so Elevate Film Festival
was this call internationally

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:10%
that we would send out,
and we would produce

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:10%
20 to 26 11-minute films.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:10%
And we'd fly these
filmmakers in,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:10%
and we'd show their
movies back to back

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:10%
in a large amphitheater,
like the Kodak theater,

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:10%
or the Nokia.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And 6,000 people
would show up to see

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
what's right with the world.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:10%
And it was so inspiring
for people to walk away

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and to actually see that
our future has the potential

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:10%
to be truly, truly amazing.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:10%
Oh, and the human nature
that came out in these films.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:10%
It was people helping people.
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:10%
It was dealing with
adversity and overcoming it.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:10%
It was so powerful.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:10%
And that they had
seven days to make it.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS:
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And it had to be seven minutes?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.037 align:middle line:10%
Well, seven to 11 minutes.

00:22:07.037 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Seven to 11 minutes.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:10%
Seven to 11 minute short film.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And then we broadened it to
music videos and commercials,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and really every form
of media that we thought

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:10%
needed to be really elevated.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:10%
And it was an incredible
experience, that ultimately

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:10%
brought together a lot of the
communities to be in one place

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:10%
together, to
acknowledge that it's

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:10%
really time to start
utilizing media

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:10%
in a powerful, positive way.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, that was a huge
vision, and it stuck.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And people were
excited about it.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:10%
And it did elevate people.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:10%
And it showed the best side
of human nature in all ways.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Of the people making the
films, and how they would

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:10%
collaborate together,
and the breakdowns,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:10%
and the breakthroughs.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:10%
All the way down to the
showing of the films.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:10%
And it winds up that one
of the people in the films

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:10%
was my neighbor.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And so it was great,
the way-- I didn't even

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:10%
know that person the way
that they were displayed

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:10%
in the film, because he
never really let me see

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:10%
that side of what he was doing.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: I
didn't know this.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I know.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:10%
I never shared that with you.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Of what he was really truly
doing in the community.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:10%
He was building cars
for short people

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:10%
and bringing up the
pedals so that they

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:10%
could drive in cars that were
refitted for shorter people.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I never knew that.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:10%
And I had to go all the way
to Film Festival to see that.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS:
Yeah, that's right.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:10%
It was great, though, just to
see all the things that were--

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:10%
so you brought about,
and we actually

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:10%
have a clip of some of the
films from Elevate Films,

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:10%
the festival, so that you
could really see and get a feel

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:10%
for what it was all about.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:50.509 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
too, because they don't

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
get the script until
the morning that they're

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.325 align:middle line:90%
starting production.

00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:56.897 align:middle line:84%
We have a celebration
of individuality here.

00:23:56.897 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to make you cry.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make you laugh.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make
you contemplate life.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are all of
my favorite things.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Hey, John.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.416 align:middle line:10%
Why 2012?
-Its secret?

00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:19.846 align:middle line:84%
It can give you
anything you want.

00:24:19.846 --> 00:24:20.818 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:24:20.818 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Shelley Berman is
teaching poetry?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.676 align:middle line:10%
He's a comic!

00:24:24.676 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:10%
We have a biofuel Hummer
here at Angel's Nest.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:90%
We worked as a team, together.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We didn't care about who's
the Jew, who's the Muslim,

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:90%
or who's the Christian.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.976 align:middle line:90%
We're not just filmmakers here.

00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We're the mouthpiece of
tomorrow making changes today.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And I got to be a judge at
one of those film festivals

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:10%
here at the Ford
amphitheater, and that

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:10%
was such a great experience.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:10%
What a great experience
of community.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:10%
And now, you can't very
well do all of that

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:10%
and not bring in all
that you're talking

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:10%
about into your company.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:10%
Because you have to walk
your talk, ultimately.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:10%
You can't produce a film
festival about consciousness,

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and oneness, and all of these
community focused issues,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:10%
and then turn around and trash
the planet and your families.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can't do that.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:10%
And that's actually a
very clear distinction.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:10%
Because not many people
would take it into the homes

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:10%
and into the families.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:10%
And you do.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:10%
You've made a very
conscious deci--

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:10%
is that part of the vision
and the mission of Elevate?

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it really is.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:10%
It's really about
implementation,

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:10%
so that all of these
concepts are more than ideas

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:10%
and more than the latest fads.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:10%
But all of us really, it's
time for us to start walking

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:10%
the talk in every single way.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we're
doing our best.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
We still have, I
would say, a ways

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to go to be a total
green company,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and to reduce our
waste and everything,

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:90%
our footprint on this planet.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:10%
But the idea that
you have about,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:10%
you all live in a
community, basically.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, basically we do.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, my family and I,
we moved just across the street

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
from the community, because we
have a 1 and 1/2 year old baby,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and we were just
feeling that we needed

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more privacy.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But that was part
of the commitment.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:10%
We had offices in downtown
LA, and three years ago we

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:10%
moved an hour and 20
minutes outside of LA

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:10%
to a quaint little
valley of 8,000 people.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:10%
And we started to-- we got
four homes on four acres,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:10%
and so we were living and
working together, and really

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:10%
experiencing, through
an experiment,

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:10%
you know, this thing we always
talk about, which is community.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:10%
What does it really mean?

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Growing your own food--

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Growing our own food.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:90%
---and meals together.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And learning about composting,
and all of this stuff.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:10%
And also, I would say, the
most important element,

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:10%
as far as I'm concerned, was the
interpersonal dynamics of, how

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:10%
do we live together as people?

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:10%
Because, you know, we're not
really good at it, in general,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.641 align:middle line:10%
It's a real challenge for us
to even be with our own family

00:27:31.641 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:10%
sometimes.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:10%
There are so many jokes
that comedians tell about,

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:10%
if you want to know how
enlightened you are,

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:10%
go home for the holidays.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, but that's real!

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is that
that keeps us at odds

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and disconnected or constantly
frustrated with each other?

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And so we all came together
in this experience of saying,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:10%
how do we work every day
together, live together, have

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:10%
dinners together, do what
we call the inner work

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:10%
together, which is really the
evolution of our own awareness.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:10%
To have conscious
clearings with each other,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:10%
instead of gossiping.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Or holding things
against each other.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll get together
and say, you know,

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been really
hanging onto this thing.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I need to really let go.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's this thing you
do, and maybe it's all me,

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
but we need to really
put this out in the open.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:10%
So it's not this hidden thing
that continues to separate

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:10%
us and harm our friendship.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: And it was
intense and wonderful.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:10%
Really wonderful.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:10%
And then on top of that,
you brought in speakers,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:10%
and you would have little
events there, and--

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.069 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: That's right.

00:28:34.069 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:10%
---shamans, and people
that really were

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.421 align:middle line:10%
there to contribute to
raising the consciousness

00:28:37.421 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:10%
of the environment.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.331 align:middle line:10%
So then that carried
through in your work.

00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:10%
We would invite the connected
communities to come in

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:10%
and to join us, so
that we weren't just

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:10%
this little exclusive
group on its own island,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:10%
but that we were constantly
intermingling, at least

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:10%
once or twice a month, with
other communities to see how

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:10%
they're living, to
show how we are living,

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:10%
to just really talk about it.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:10%
What are we learning
from each other?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:10%
And what can we do
in our workspace

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:10%
to transform our environment?

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Because we spend more than
half of our lives at work.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And so many people
are miserable at work.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.939 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:10%
How do we become
more creative such

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.160 align:middle line:10%
that we can make our livings
that we need to make,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:10%
so that we can pay
for the things,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:10%
that we really don't need, but
that we have, and be happy?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Be happy people.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And then a film
came out of that.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:84%
A kind of movement or
environment of free energy.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:10%
There was a whole conversation
that you were in about creating

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:10%
free energy, and there has
been an ongoing conversation

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.179 align:middle line:10%
about that.
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:29:35.179 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:10%
So tell me about that video.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:10%
What is that about,
the free energy video?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.740 align:middle line:10%
We did a music video with our
friends, The Luminaries, which

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:10%
are a conscious hip hop group.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
An amazing group
here in Los Angeles.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when there is information
that we want to get out

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:84%
to the world, particularly
younger audiences,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:90%
we devise ways to do that.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:10%
You know, we can sit down
and have some talking head

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:10%
talk about it, which is boring.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:10%
Or we can put it into a song.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And so we've done three or four
songs now with The Luminaries,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:10%
where we'll give them pages of
research on a particular topic,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:10%
and they'll write an
incredible song out of it,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:10%
and they'll go into the
studio and record it,

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll
produce a music video.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh!
-And we'll release that.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And it'll bring awareness
to, in this particular case,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:10%
it was the free energy
video, was really

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:10%
about all of the patents
that have been locked away,

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:10%
that hold the secrets to
inventions that have been

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:36.690 align:middle line:10%
either recently created
or decades ago, That

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:10%
hold the potential
to literally solve

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:10%
our power issues in this world.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It can completely
end our need for oil.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:10%
For everything right now
that we're struggling over,

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:10%
and even really
creating war over.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.060 align:middle line:10%
There are these devices by
using, generating the power

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:10%
of our organic systems,
generate all the power that we

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:10%
will ever need on this planet.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is, then why
have they been so suppressed?

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, greed and all
the stuff that has suppressed

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:90%
all good information forever.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And why would you
put that valuable information

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:90%
into a rap song?

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, did it translate?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
MIKKI WILLIS: It did, yeah.
LISA GARR: It did?

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.675 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Well,
I'll let the people

00:31:18.675 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:10%
decide that on their own.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yeah, well you have.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's the key to
our future right there.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, is how to you
bring awareness to that.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:10%
I guess you do need awareness
in many different forms.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:10%
In documentaries, in
music, in conversation.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:10%
And what you have done is
you've brought it to people

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:10%
in many different ways.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Why do you put, and I've
noticed this in your company,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:10%
such an important
emphasis on social media?

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:10%
What is the mission behind that?

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Well actually, in 2008 we
stopped the film festival.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:10%
I went on a really
tremendous journey to Peru,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:10%
and spent some time
with a tribe up

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:10%
on the very top of the Andes.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:10%
And I had another
awakening in my life.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Life, our growth, is a
series of awakenings.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And it can be stimulated
by deaths, or wonderful--

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.105 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Transformational
moments, yeah.

00:32:12.105 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
That's right.
Peak moments.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had one of
those peak moments.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was shortly after
our last film festival,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
in October of 2008 which
was a strain on our company,

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:84%
because the economic
collapse and everything that

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
had happened, a lot of
our sponsors pulled out.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.150 align:middle line:10%
And it was the first
time that we had actually

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:10%
lost money on an event.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:10%
And we were really
questioning, how do we do this?

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:10%
How do we bring
this to the people,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:10%
and also not go bankrupt,
and stay alive here,

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:10%
and have the life that
we choose to have?

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Peru, just to kind
of get clear on all of that.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guidance that I received
from that, from some very deep

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:84%
meditations, was to stop
the film festival for now,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and to get involved
in the internet.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.387 align:middle line:10%
That the internet
had been created--

00:32:58.387 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: You got
that from Peru?

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.814 align:middle line:90%
I did, I did, yeah.

00:33:00.814 --> 00:33:01.680 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's amazing.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:10%
That the internet
had been created

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:10%
as this incredible world
wide web of information,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:10%
that is one of the
only things that exists

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:10%
right now that's uncensored.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.510 align:middle line:10%
That the people, we can
share our information,

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:10%
and our truths,
without-- it's not like

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.817 align:middle line:10%
a network that's owned by--

00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: No,
it's people driven.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:10%
---a bigger company.
Totally people driven.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:10%
And we can reach people on
the other side of the world

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:10%
with the click of a button.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And it became clear
that we weren't doing

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:10%
enough work in the internet.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And so we developed
some technologies

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:10%
that would help some of
these conscious media--

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:10%
these projects, to
get out to the world.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:10%
And we really decided to focus
on social media at that point,

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:10%
so we could reach more people.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:10%
And you being at the
forefront of that,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:10%
have you noticed that the
trends have moved now--

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.050 align:middle line:10%
have tipped to the
side of social media,

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:10%
as opposed to traditional
media in this genre,

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:10%
in the consciousness genre?

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.939 align:middle line:84%
I think so.
Yeah.

00:33:55.939 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone
sees it as a way.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
We're all hoping that television
will catch up someday.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, that's why I
support shows like this,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:10%
that also have your freedom to
talk about subjects like this,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:10%
which the people are so hungry
for, without being interrupted

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:10%
by a commercial for McDonald's.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Right?
LISA GARR: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm witnessing that now,
when I'm letting my little one

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:84%
watch, you know, Disney
Jr. And the show's amazing,

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.389 align:middle line:84%
but then it's interrupted by
some propaganda commercial.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Here we have yoga commercials,
and Deepak will say something.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.299 align:middle line:90%
So important.

00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it keeps it
all on the same--

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:84%
MIKKI WILLIS:
Really, so important.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.880 align:middle line:10%
But I do see that
there are a lot

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.469 align:middle line:10%
of-- even television is trending
towards a massive shift.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:10%
And will it ever,
within our lifetimes,

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:10%
be completely transformed?

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't even
matter, because the people

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:90%
are voting with their dollars.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.699 align:middle line:10%
And they're starting
to spend more time

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:10%
in choosing what they want.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:90%
And it's commercial free.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It's uninterrupted.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:10%
They're choosing to watch the
movies they choose to watch.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And gradually, they're
understanding the impact

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:10%
of everything that
we put in our bodies,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:10%
from information to our
food, literally creates

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:10%
our experience of this life.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:10%
And so it's our responsibility
to literally feed ourselves

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:10%
the best, and only the best.
-Yes.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And I love the fact that Elevate
and what we're doing at Gaiam,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:10%
it's so well aligned.
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Because you're coming
from a conscious place.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:10%
You're consuming
conscious media,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:10%
and you're also putting
out conscious media.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's the whole point.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.060 align:middle line:10%
And if we could have more
companies like yours,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:10%
and Gaiam, and
others, it just will

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:10%
grow the entire genre of this.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:10%
And before we know
it, it'll be tipped

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.580 align:middle line:10%
into the side of
bringing consciousness

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.501 align:middle line:10%
into everyone's living room.

00:35:45.501 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: And it's
a really big thing.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:84%
MIKKI WILLIS: Because
what I realized

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago was this.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a point I kind
of became an activist,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and was angry at
my own industry.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, Hollywood
is just a store.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:10%
And stores put on the
shelves what sells.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.090 align:middle line:10%
That's all it is.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And as long as we keep ordering
the kind of programming

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.400 align:middle line:10%
that the masses are
ordering out there,

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.950 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood's going to
keep providing it.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:09.649 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But the moment that those
products stay on the shelves,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and people aren't
ordering them, they'll

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:90%
start ordering more of this.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
gradually happening.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would say rapidly
happening right now.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.276 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It is, yeah.

00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:10%
People are going,
I didn't even know

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:10%
I wanted this kind of a
show, but I saw an episode,

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:10%
and it made me feel good.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Which is what people want at
the core, is to feel good.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.950 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes, absolutely.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
MIKKI WILLIS: And so it's
happening, which is amazing.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Well there's a film that
came your way which I think

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.741 align:middle line:10%
is a perfect example of what
this whole conversation is

00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:10%
about.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's this movie
called "Be Brave."

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: That's right.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to explain
how this came into your life.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.411 align:middle line:10%
And this story is
absolutely chilling.

00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:10%
I have been waiting
for a movie like this

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:10%
for a number of years.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I took 4 and 1/2 years
off of my directing career

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to create a distribution
platform that I

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:90%
thought would take a year.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But it took 3 and
1/2 years to create.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I just started to
open up to the possibility

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:90%
of directing another movie.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But everything that
was coming my way

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.620 align:middle line:84%
was-- I had made
a comment one day.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't want
to direct a movie.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to direct the
movie every time.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not just
here to make movies.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:10%
I want to say what I really
want to say out there.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:10%
Something that I
can say, that was

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:10%
the top of my point of
my personal consciousness

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:10%
at that moment.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:10%
That's what I wanted to say.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't find anything
that really lit me up.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:10%
And lo and behold, the moment
I really announced, this

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:10%
is the next leg of my adventure,
to direct the movie that I

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:10%
really want to share with
the world, a friend of mine

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:10%
got a hold of me, and he said,
I have stumbled upon a pretty

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:10%
interesting story
that I think is

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:10%
right for you and your company.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:10%
And the long and
short of it is this.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:84%
There is an aspiring
filmmaker out of Canada

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:90%
who documented his entire life.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Self portraits.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, like, I don't
know anyone who's ever

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.990 align:middle line:84%
documented their life
like this young man named

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.739 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Northcott.
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:21.230 align:middle line:10%
He would set up the camera
while he was-- from a distance,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.950 align:middle line:10%
it may look like
vanity, but the kid

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.820 align:middle line:10%
knew exactly what he was doing.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:84%
He would just be shaving,
and he'd set up the camera.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:84%
He would be in a
conversation with a friend,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.531 align:middle line:84%
and he would just set
up a camera or two.

00:38:30.531 --> 00:38:32.611 align:middle line:84%
It pulls you in.
I mean, it was like a witness.

00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:84%
-That's right.
-Yes.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:10%
You don't notice the camera
when you're watching--

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: That's right.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.800 align:middle line:10%
---the clips.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And his passion in
life, his mission,

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:84%
was to prove that the
world-- prove to the world

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:90%
that people are interconnected.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And that becomes such
a cliche, but there's

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:10%
a science behind it.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:10%
And there's a science
that actually proves

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:10%
that even though there's
physical space between us,

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:10%
that we are
energetically connected.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:10%
And so he started
to travel the world

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:10%
to meet with
indigenous cultures,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:10%
and just really learn about
humanity at 20 years old.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:10%
For nine years he travelled, and
went to 42 different countries.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:10%
And along the way,
he would pick up

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:10%
some memorabilia, just
to remember each culture

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:10%
that he was visiting.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And it could be a pot
handle, or a piece of stone,

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.700 align:middle line:10%
or a piece of wood.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
His journey-- the last
leg of his journey

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.260 align:middle line:84%
took him to a Mayan cave
in the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
on footage, on tape.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
He was being guided
by a Mexican guide,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and his friend was
translating Spanish.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They got hours into this cave,
and they came to a Mayan burial

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
site, where the bodies
had been left that were

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:90%
sacrificed to the gods.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:90%
So mostly women and children.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And they came on
a pile of bones.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And the kid was
obsessed with circles.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Northcott was
obsessed with circles,

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:84%
because he realized that
from the cells and the atoms

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, to the spherical
nature of the universe,

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.320 align:middle line:84%
for the cosmos and
all of the planets,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are these circles
within circles, that have

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.430 align:middle line:90%
trapped ourselves within boxes.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Within cubicles, and homes,
and we need to be out in nature

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with
the source, right?

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So he found this
little perfectly

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:90%
round bone in this Mayan cave.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And he told the guide
that he wanted to take it.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the guide went on for
15 minutes to tell him,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.067 align:middle line:90%
do not take that.

00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Don't take these.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Super dangerous.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.270 align:middle line:84%
You will get sick, and
your family may get sick.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Please listen to me.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And the kid just kept--
he actually later

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
said it was like Gollum, from
Lord of the Rings, saying,

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
my precious, take me.
LISA GARR: He can't.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't.
He was obsessed with it.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.303 align:middle line:84%
It was like an
energy was coming--

00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:84%
He's on camera saying, please
tell him, I want it so bad,

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and tell him why, and tell him
I have a bond with the gods,

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and they'll understand.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guide said,
do not take it.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:middle line:90%
He took it.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And took this little round
bone, and a little bit later, he

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.620 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed with bone cancer.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And he documented his
entire death process,

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
up until the final
days of his life.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And so the family
got a hold of me--

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And he put
together it was the bone.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah, at one
point he put it together.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He realized, oh my god, I have
cancer of the bone marrow.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:90%
I have leukemia.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I took a bone from a Mayan cave.
Oh my god.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.011 align:middle line:84%
And he told his family
where to find it.

00:41:35.011 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Go get it.
Take it back for me.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:84%
He was too sick at that point,
but he wanted to take it back.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And they had a search party that
looked for it, and it was gone.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after his death,
the family-- it just appeared.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It reappeared.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: I want to have you
guys take a look at the trailer

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.240 align:middle line:10%
here, because this
shows the story of what

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Mikki has been talking about.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:10%
It's definitely chilling.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this
"Be Brave" trailer.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:84%
At 29 years old, a Vancouver
filmmaker was told he

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:90%
only had months left to live.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But instead of putting
the camera down,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:90%
he turned the lens on himself.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:10%
This is the story of
my brother, Daniel,

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:10%
his extraordinary
adventures to 42 countries,

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:10%
and a choice he
made in a Mayan cave

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.100 align:middle line:10%
that may have ended his life.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Dan was an aspiring filmmaker.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Over a 10 year period,
he documented just

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
about every moment of
his incredible life.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:84%
His video camera was
like a microscope

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.450 align:middle line:84%
through which he studied his
two favorite subjects, nature

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and humanity.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He saw all living things as
one brilliant and beautiful

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:90%
organism.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.132 align:middle line:84%
You are made of a
trillion trembling orbs,

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and each one of them is
made of a trillion more.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:90%
So is the galaxy.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:90%
So is the ocean.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.714 align:middle line:84%
So is the one you
love and long for.

00:42:56.714 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into
their eyes, what is

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:90%
this truth that you will see?

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.411 align:middle line:90%
Circles in circles.

00:43:02.411 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
He's about three or four years
old, and it starts to rain.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:90%
He's turning in circles.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.851 align:middle line:84%
He's going, Mommy, Mommy,
the stars are kissing me!

00:43:14.851 --> 00:43:17.514 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-This kid was a star child.

00:43:17.514 --> 00:43:18.496 align:middle line:90%
He was connected.

00:43:18.496 --> 00:43:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.380 align:middle line:84%
As a way to remain connected
with each new culture

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:84%
he explored, Daniel
always collected

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.146 align:middle line:90%
small pieces of nature.

00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:34.150 align:middle line:84%
A stone, a shell,
a fossil, a bone.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.390 align:middle line:84%
In April of 2007, his journey
led him deep into the darkness

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.970 align:middle line:90%
of a Mayan cave.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It was there, among the remains
of an ancient burial ground,

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that my brother made an
immeasurable mistake.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.682 align:middle line:90%
It's a joint or something.

00:43:51.682 --> 00:44:02.316 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.316 --> 00:44:04.855 align:middle line:10%
They say that people have
taken these bones home,

00:44:04.855 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:10%
and as soon as they get
home, they get sick.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:13.245 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.245 --> 00:44:14.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the history.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.036 align:middle line:10%
I want it so bad.

00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:23.012 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.012 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
The moment he came
in contact with it,

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.532 align:middle line:90%
he knew it magnetically.

00:44:26.532 --> 00:44:27.945 align:middle line:90%
He wanted it.

00:44:27.945 --> 00:44:29.358 align:middle line:90%
He needed it.

00:44:29.358 --> 00:44:32.042 align:middle line:84%
He knew the gods
would understand.

00:44:32.042 --> 00:44:34.196 align:middle line:90%
He felt they had a bond.

00:44:34.196 --> 00:44:35.630 align:middle line:84%
This would just
make it stronger.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Not long after my brother
Daniel took a bone from a Mayan

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.408 align:middle line:84%
burial site, he was
diagnosed with leukemia,

00:44:47.408 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:90%
a bone marrow cancer.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.176 align:middle line:84%
The average person would live
about three to six months.

00:44:56.176 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I want to stay and love!

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:10%
It's not time.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.035 align:middle line:84%
So if you were sitting
on this side of the desk,

00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:04.885 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:45:04.885 --> 00:45:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that removing such
an object from a sacred site

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.716 align:middle line:84%
was wrong, Daniel wanted
to return the bone.

00:45:14.716 --> 00:45:16.690 align:middle line:90%
He looked everywhere for it.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.160 align:middle line:90%
But he just couldn't find it.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It was as if it had disappeared.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.340 align:middle line:84%
After a fierce and painful
battle with leukemia,

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.246 align:middle line:84%
my little brother made his
transition at 29 years young.

00:45:29.246 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
After Daniel's death,
as we were going

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:38.900 align:middle line:84%
through his personal
belongings, the bone reappeared.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Out of respect for
the Mayan people,

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I will retrace my brother's
steps to the cave in Mexico

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to return the bone to its
rightful resting place.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:10%
This new footage will be
used to thread together

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.070 align:middle line:10%
my brother's epic adventure.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:47:06.276 align:middle line:90%


00:47:06.276 --> 00:47:09.264 align:middle line:90%
Gonna walk the earth.

00:47:09.264 --> 00:47:11.754 align:middle line:90%
Gonna walk the earth again.

00:47:11.754 --> 00:47:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.310 align:middle line:10%
When you called me
and said, take a look

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:10%
at this short video, and
I went and looked at it,

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.870 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't speak.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I had that, oh my god, this is--
so many things came flooding

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:90%
into my head at one moment.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But just the idea that prophecy
is so real and intentionality

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.020 align:middle line:84%
is so strong, that it will last
generations upon generations.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:10%
And to actually cause
a death of somebody,

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.470 align:middle line:10%
if you break into the prophecy,
is so incredibly powerful.

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There's so many directions,
but how did you then

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.380 align:middle line:90%
get in contact with the sister?

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the friend
who brought it to me

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.370 align:middle line:90%
was in contact with the family.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.767 align:middle line:90%
And as soon as I saw--

00:48:04.767 --> 00:48:05.500 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.590 align:middle line:84%
He gave me the
pitch, and I thought,

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.590 align:middle line:90%
this can't be that amazing.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
there's some existing

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:90%
footage you should see.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And he sent it to me, a link.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I watched 40
minutes of footage,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and I cried, and I was just
dumbfounded, and I said,

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.940 align:middle line:90%
this is my next movie.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I need
to meet the family.

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a long letter to
the family that he forwarded.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, this is
what I've been waiting for.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And I relate to Daniel so much.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Where he comes from,
and everything-- really

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:90%
everything about him.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.100 align:middle line:84%
There were so many parallels
between myself and Daniel,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.430 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my
20s particularly.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I knew him,
just from my first glance of him

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and the first word I heard
him speak, I thought,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I know this young man.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And so I met with the family.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.810 align:middle line:84%
They flew in from Canada, and
we spent several days together,

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and I fell in love with
both Daniel's sister Erin,

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:90%
and his mother Tanya.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And then later, I flew to
Canada with my wife and child,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and we spent a week
there with them, just

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:90%
getting to know each other.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And just in January of this
month, we-- one of the things I

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:19.250 align:middle line:84%
said to the family before
I solidified our agreement,

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:23.240 align:middle line:84%
was I said, well for
me, I said, first

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:90%
of all, where is this bone now?

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's
buried off of an island,

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:90%
just off of Vancouver.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the
bone has to go back.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.460 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you're willing
to take it back,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the backbone of
this movie, of us completing

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.160 align:middle line:84%
the circle, and
undoing what your son

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and brother did, the circle that
he broke, the sacred circle.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you're willing
to do that, I'm in.

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they're super
courageous women.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Amazing women.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said, totally.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in January, we
actually took five cameras,

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and we went back to
the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and the family returned the
bone to the burial ground.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They had to actually go through
this totally treacherous cave.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Did you find the
shaman that took you in?

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.990 align:middle line:90%
The guide?

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We ended up with
exactly the same guide.

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.880 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of synchronistic
magic happened.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The moment we pulled
up to this little town,

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.730 align:middle line:84%
a young man came out and said,
hey, what are you guys doing?

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we're
going to the caves.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, my
father leads a tour there.

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll have him come
and lead you guys.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And he shows up,
and it's the guy.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And we were like, whoa.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And once we got into the
cave, we knew that that was

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.480 align:middle line:90%
big enough of a story to tell.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:90%
But the story expanded.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he saw this
object, he said, I remember.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember, four years
ago, telling that young man

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.477 align:middle line:90%
not to take that object.

00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:47.610 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And was
he shocked when

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.790 align:middle line:90%
you told him that he had died?

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:84%
He was shocked and
not surprised at all.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.930 align:middle line:84%
But he said, let me tell you the
mythology behind this object.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And he started to break
out this amazing story

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient relic that was
planted by the ancient Mayans.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ultimately
what came out of this

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.730 align:middle line:84%
was that it was more powerful
than any of the bones

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.300 align:middle line:90%
in the burial ground.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
relic that was planted

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:90%
to protect the burial site.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And they have a name for
it, and a history behind it,

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:10%
which we're going to wait until
people see the film to actually

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.070 align:middle line:10%
discover what it is.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And then we spent--
oh, the other thing

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.740 align:middle line:10%
that happened in the cave,
as he's telling the story,

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.230 align:middle line:10%
was Daniel's dying words never
made sense to the family.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.740 align:middle line:90%
They were pretty obscure.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And they always said, well,
maybe he was on chemo,

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and who knows where
that came from.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But as this man is
telling the story on film,

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Erin goes, oh my god,
Daniel's dying words.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.210 align:middle line:90%
They made perfect sense.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.150 align:middle line:84%
They connected with
this mythology.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel knew nothing
about this mythology,

00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.590 align:middle line:84%
but he somehow downloaded
it right before he died.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.770 align:middle line:10%
And then we spent a week
traveling around meeting

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.610 align:middle line:10%
priests and shamans to find
out if this mythology was

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:10.000 align:middle line:10%
accurate for this Mayan culture.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And everyone
corroborated the story,

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:90%
told us deeper details about it.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
spooky, really powerful.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it had a lot of us,
which were, I would say up

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to that point, there
were a lot of us

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that were skeptical about--

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:29.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Healthy skepticism.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Healthy skepticism.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But we were kind of like,
look, if you believe

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.400 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause
cancer, then it can cause--

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.580 align:middle line:90%
anything can cause cancer.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.480 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, interesting.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But it could just
be a rock, or a bone.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's not put too
much energy into it.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.370 align:middle line:84%
After meeting with these elders
and these people, the way

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:47.660 align:middle line:84%
they broke it down from a
place not of superstition,

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:84%
but a place of
understanding that energy

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.590 align:middle line:84%
can be infused into
these inanimate objects.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were really feeling
like the people of the West,

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.230 align:middle line:84%
particularly, need to really
understand the sacredness

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:00.020 align:middle line:90%
of these objects.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We all left with a new
respect for the possibility

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps this
item, thing, actually

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.290 align:middle line:84%
did create the cancer that took
the life of Daniel Northcott.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.894 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very possible.
-That's what I got.

00:53:15.894 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what I got from it.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:10%
And how powerful and potent
these prophecies are.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And, if you take it
down to our level,

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.920 align:middle line:10%
any intention really,
really can be,

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:10%
when you see the manifestation
of it in that way.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.050 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: It's wild.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:29.990 align:middle line:10%
It's incredible.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And then you created a
social media campaign

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:10%
so that you could
raise money to complete

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.830 align:middle line:10%
the film, which I witnessed.

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely incredible.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.083 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: More
than witnessed.

00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:10%
You helped by putting
us on your radio show.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for all
of your continued support

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.190 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.749 align:middle line:84%
I believe in it.
Yes.

00:53:45.749 --> 00:53:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I do think this
movie needs to get

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:90%
out and get made and so forth.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And it shows, also, the power
of story and social media,

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.240 align:middle line:10%
and when you connect
it all together,

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.641 align:middle line:10%
how it really does work.

00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:56.540 align:middle line:10%
MIKKI WILLIS: That's right.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:03.000 align:middle line:10%
We raised $184,000 online
to complete "Be Brave."

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And we did it through a
crowdfunding platform.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
heartwarming to feel

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.830 align:middle line:84%
all of our connected family
and friends and community step

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.600 align:middle line:84%
forward to say, this
film has to be made.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes, it does.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is it
a-- it's a perfect vehicle

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring this kind of a message
to the mainstream audiences,

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of like
a Blair Witch meets Into

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:28.764 align:middle line:90%
the Wild, meets Indiana Jones.

00:54:28.764 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right,
yeah, that's you.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You could do all sorts
of things with it.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Because it's a compelling
mystery, but at the same time,

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.660 align:middle line:10%
the underlying message
is to respect the sacred,

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.870 align:middle line:10%
to complete the circles in our
lives that have been broken,

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:10%
and to really
consider how connected

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.040 align:middle line:10%
we are with each other and
all that is, all of nature.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.140 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly what
your company is about.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.770 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly the message
that you put out there.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly what
we've been talking about.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.490 align:middle line:10%
The power of oneness,
and to really

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:10%
live in that place of
connectivity and community

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:10%
through any way.
MIKKI WILLIS: Yeah.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:10%
It could be through humor.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:10%
It could be through media.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:06.660 align:middle line:10%
It could be through story.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.900 align:middle line:10%
All of that.
MIKKI WILLIS: That's right.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:08.966 align:middle line:90%
And it could be through family.

00:55:08.966 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to show this
quick little piece of you

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:90%
and your little baby son.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:10%
Of you in this pure state
of connection and love.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this video.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to show this,
because I'm a mom.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.922 align:middle line:84%
Going on a tour with
my best friend Azai.

00:55:28.922 --> 00:55:32.815 align:middle line:84%
We haven't done this
in a little while.

00:55:32.815 --> 00:55:33.918 align:middle line:90%
Can I have a kiss?

00:55:33.918 --> 00:55:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a kiss!
AZAI: [LAUGHS]

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.638 align:middle line:84%
That's our newest thing.
Mwah!

00:55:43.638 --> 00:55:45.114 align:middle line:90%
We love it!

00:55:45.114 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.080 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.544 align:middle line:84%
Mwah, yeah!
Mwah!

00:55:54.544 --> 00:55:58.456 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.456 --> 00:55:59.615 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:59.615 --> 00:56:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:03.010 align:middle line:90%
That was a wet one.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.935 align:middle line:90%
Let's go see the water, buddy.

00:56:04.935 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's go see the water.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:09.400 align:middle line:10%
I just had to show
that, because it

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:10%
is so important for us
to laugh at ourselves,

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:14.100 align:middle line:10%
and to make fun of
everything that we do.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Because laughter alleviates
energy, and elevates energy.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much, Mikki.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Lisa, it's
been my pleasure.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much.
-Absolutely.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.360 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for sharing
the time with me,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.190 align:middle line:10%
and all that you share in
the world and the alignment

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:10%
that you have with the
mission of Gaiam as well.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.910 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Just what you've been doing
for years, I want to say.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Way before it was popular.
Thank you.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.920 align:middle line:90%
You got that right!

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, Mikki.
MIKKI WILLIS: Thank you.
