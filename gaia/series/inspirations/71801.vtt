00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And today's story is one of
courage, acceptance, surrender,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of inspiration.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
At six weeks old, Karen
Kain's baby, Lorrin,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
had an adverse reaction to her
one and only DPT vaccination,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and the vaccine
attacked her brain,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
leaving her with severe brain
damage, blind, nonverbal,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and a quadriplegic
with daily seizures.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And she only had the ability
to blink to communicate.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Karen Kain is the
courageous mother of Lorrin,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and she published a memoir
called "A Unique Life Fully

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Lived," a loving tribute to
her daughter, who passed away

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 15.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you or anyone
you know is part

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of the ever-growing
percentage of families today

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
who are raising
special needs children,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Karen Kain has become a beacon
of light and inspiration,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
sharing the life
skills that she learned

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and that Lorrin is teaching
her about surrendering

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and how to embrace life's
journey, which you have fully

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN KAIN: Thank you.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored to be here.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, tell us a little
bit about when you-- I mean,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
were you always a
pioneer like this?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Have you always been one
to carry the torch forward

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and to be a beacon of
light to many people?

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Was that always who you were?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: No.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I really had no idea what
I wanted to do in life.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I always knew I
wanted to be a mother.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And someone told me that
of every species when

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.835 align:middle line:84%
a baby is at risk,
the mother goes crazy.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what happened to me.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I loved Lorrin and I just
wanted to do everything

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I could possibly do
to take care of her

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.452 align:middle line:84%
and give her the
best life possible.

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you never
felt like you went crazy.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe there was moments
where you felt, of course,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that you were going
to lose it completely.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're here today
with so much strength

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and so much courage.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.495 align:middle line:90%
And did you ever feel like that?

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever feel
that there were

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
moments where you were going
to just lose it completely?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It was
really hard, and yes.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.197 align:middle line:90%
And I think every parent does.

00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
With Lorrin, because
everybody gave me

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
such bad information
about her, I had no hope.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So the good thing is I didn't
have any rules, so I just

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.231 align:middle line:90%
made up my own.

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I just loved
her and the more she

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
went through adversity,
the stronger she was.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always kind
of learning from her,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and I really was piggybacking
on her strength and her courage.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then she taught me
really to be separate

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and be alone and
take care of myself.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I just needed
her to do her soul agreement

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and let me do my soul agreement.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.868 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:53.155 align:middle line:90%
You have learned so much.

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take it
back to the beginning.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have a picture here of
Lorrin when she was a baby.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Now is this particular
picture, in the purple blanket,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
was it before or after
she had the vaccine?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: It was right after.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it was right after
one of her hospital stays.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:90%
She was very, very young.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
She was just a couple
months old and she

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
had a reaction at
six weeks of age

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to her one and only DPT vaccine.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So she had a seizure two
hours after the vaccine,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and then she had another
seizure after that.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Both of those seizures
were five minutes long.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very long time
to watch and hold my baby,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
convulse and shake and
scream, out of control.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you do?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Where did you take her?

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.064 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I just held as far away
from me as I possibly could.

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I was so afraid.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.126 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, but
where did you go?

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to the hospital?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.219 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I went back to the
pediatrician's immediately.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was in
the pediatrician's office,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.392 align:middle line:90%
she had another seizure.

00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just started screaming
at the pediatrician, you know,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:90%
make it stop.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Make it stop.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was very calm and then
I was really afraid of Lorrin.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
She sent me back
to the hospital,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and then we spent
a couple days there

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and ran all kinds
of tests trying

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what it was.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:84%
No one was talking about
vaccine injury at the time.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They just kept saying babies
sometimes have seizures.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.042 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of my life changing forever.

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we have
a picture here of her

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital going
through some of these tests.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you relate
it back to the vaccine?

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It was so
obvious, because two hours

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:90%
after the vaccine.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But because nobody talked
about it, this was back in '94,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.187 align:middle line:84%
there was no internet,
I was all alone.

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I really hoped
that she would just

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.027 align:middle line:90%
stop having seizures.

00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And that did not happen.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They say kids
grow out of them.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Right.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
She was three months old
when the doctors really

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.006 align:middle line:84%
told me to go home,
prepare for the worst,

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
there was something
really wrong.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
She had nine five-minute
seizures in one day

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:84%
at three months of age, and
her body was just lifeless.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was just no
answers to be had by anyone.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
We kept doing test after test.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I met a doctor
and he told me

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that he thought it was a
classic vaccine reaction.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
researching and talking

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
about vaccines, the
old-fashioned way,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, via phone
and em-- not emails,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:90%
but just writing and calling.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And we learned that
children have injuries

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and there was a compensation
program called the Vaccine

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.475 align:middle line:84%
Compensation Program
that was started-- well,

00:05:12.475 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
it was changed in
1986, and Lorrin

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
qualified because
of the reaction.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And her vaccination
actually had 30 seizures--

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
kids had 30 seizures
or worse with that lot.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And then with the surrounding
lots, there was 10 deaths.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With that particular
batch of vaccines?

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Mm-hm.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The surrounding lot from her
vaccination had 10 deaths.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot-- we don't get to
ask how many is in a lot.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The government protects the drug
companies from telling us that,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
but with Lorrin's lot and
the lots surrounding it,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
there were 10 deaths
from children.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, we immediately-- the
government immediately agreed

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:90%
that Lorrin was vaccine injured.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the drug companies?

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Was there any responsibility
taken in any way?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: They don't have
to be responsible at all.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The government has protected
them for many, many years,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.115 align:middle line:90%
because-- it's very complicated.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In 1960, the drug companies
wanted to stop making vaccines

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.334 align:middle line:90%
because he kept getting sued.

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So they started pulling
out and the government

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.041 align:middle line:84%
stepped in and said,
you make the vaccines,

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and we'll make a program
up to protect you.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot sue your doctor
and you cannot sue the drug

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you buy the vaccine,
they tax the vaccine.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So the money that goes to
vaccine injured families

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:90%
like mine is from tax.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come from the drug
companies or the government.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It comes from,
basically, the taxpayer.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
a vaccine court.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And vaccine court, most people
don't know anything about it

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want you to know.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's very private.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:84%
When we went to court,
there's no due process.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So in America-- this is
the only area in America

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you do not get due process, and
that's the Vaccine Compensation

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Program, where they
have special masters.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, they
had 11 special masters

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and we had one picked
for our family.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we went
into a little room

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.199 align:middle line:84%
and had our court time held
with just about six people.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't really
want you to go to court

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and get a judge and a jury.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's not a judge.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:90%
There's not a jury.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that they are

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:90%
well-suited to take care of.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
There's an overhead for it.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a court system for it.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
There's governmental
protection around it.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.616 align:middle line:90%
So this is obviously a problem.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It's a huge problem,
especially for-- well,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.884 align:middle line:84%
for vaccine inured
families like myself,

00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
they immediately said
she was vaccine injured.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
find your own attorney,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and back in there was only one.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a great video that Rob
Schneider does about vaccine

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
court because the attorneys
for the government

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
have an endless amount of
money, and for the individuals,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:90%
you know, you're very limited.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
They only pay the
attorneys so much

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's very-- they make
it as difficult as possible.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I felt very bullied.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.514 align:middle line:84%
They tried to prove
me a bad parent

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
at one point, the
first time I met them.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They did?

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yes.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed our
award off as long

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
as they could because
they were expecting Lorrin

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.045 align:middle line:84%
to die because
she was very sick.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my God!

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.268 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And I was devastated.

00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was broken.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And I just thought--

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course!

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.139 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -they were
there to help me,

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and I found very quickly
that they were not my friends

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were not there to
support my family in healing.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:90%
They wanted us to go away.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're dealing with
the trauma of your baby, who

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
was obviously having
seizures and you

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
were challenged by
that, and you were

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:84%
dealing with this court
system at the same time.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Did you have
support from anyone?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Anyone?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: At that
time, we had just

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:90%
moved for my husband's work.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.239 align:middle line:90%
At that time, I was searching.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:31.751 align:middle line:90%
I joined some support groups.

00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I connected
with a parent or two

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:90%
that had a child with seizures.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of thrown
into it, and I was really

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:84%
isolated from everything I
knew because my daughter was

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
very sick.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.935 align:middle line:84%
And people-- when you
have chronic illness,

00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to keep your
family intact and your friends

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
intact because not
very many people really

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.192 align:middle line:90%
want to be near you.

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And today, it's better
because you have the internet.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
connections on the internet.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And I always just
felt at that time,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.909 align:middle line:84%
that's when I got
through all this,

00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:03.491 align:middle line:84%
that I would give back and try
to help families that are going

00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
through this and share
my story to support them.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's what
you're absolutely doing.

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So after this whole
process and you

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
realized that this
was a challenge,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
this was-- she was
truly vaccine injured,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
how did you start
to hear her voice?

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.645 align:middle line:84%
What did-- how did the
communication begin?

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It was
really interesting

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.644 align:middle line:84%
because in the
beginning, everyone just

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
said, go home and
prepare for the worst.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So every time I went to the
doctors, I got bad news.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was devastated.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But there was that inner
faith or that inner heart

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
string I think
every parent has--

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intuition.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Right.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, Lorrin was
about three months old

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the first time someone
told me that she

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.383 align:middle line:84%
had come to them
in a dream and she

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:90%
had talked to them in a dream.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- I actually went
in to purchase something

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.535 align:middle line:84%
and then I went
back the next day

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and the women just
said, matter of fact,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.535 align:middle line:84%
your daughter came to me
in my dream last night.

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was she psychic?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Or was--

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: She was.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And so I asked
her, I said, well,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:90%
what did she say about me?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, oh,
we were just talking.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of planted
a seed for me.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, what's going on?

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And I just became more drawn
to alternative medicine,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, because modern
medicine was not giving me

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
any support or any good news.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.343 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I just
started opening the doors

00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to alternative healing.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, I
really wanted to heal Lorrin.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted her to be
a healthy baby girl,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
so I started doing
everything I could possibly

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
do to get her healed.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And in that process,
I really learned

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that I needed the
healing and that Lorrin

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:90%
was perfect the way she was.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: We built sweat lodges.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I did drops and tinctures.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Craniosacral therapy,
acupuncture, macrobiotic diets,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:90%
juicing.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything--

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.678 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course, yes.

00:10:41.678 --> 00:10:44.544 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -that you could think
of alternative, I tried.

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Part of the journey.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.841 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutley.

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you also did develop
a communication style with her

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
around the blinking,
around-- how did you

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.469 align:middle line:84%
teach her to communicate
through blinking?

00:10:55.469 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I knew she
was in there and I

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
could see she didn't
like certain things

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.117 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't like the
taste of certain medicines.

00:11:03.117 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And she was very forceful.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:90%
She loved to eat.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just had felt
that she was in there.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew when we came
home, she would smile.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And she would smile
at certain things.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
any better, so I just

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
treated her like she was normal.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And then when I cooked
all her food and pureed

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
it and she would
like certain things.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So I basically started
with things like chocolate

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.887 align:middle line:84%
and said, if you want
chocolate, you have to blink.

00:11:25.887 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
getting green beans.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just an
intuition that you came up

00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
with or had you learned of this?

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.263 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: I just could tell.

00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- it's just kind of when
you're around someone who is

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:90%
intuitive, it's not a word.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%
You just get that feeling.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And I got that feeling from her.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was really baby steps.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.932 align:middle line:90%
One thing led to another.

00:11:44.932 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I would meet someone
and they would

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
come up and be really
drawn to Lorrin.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it was because
she was exuding love.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
We would walk in the room
and people are afraid of it

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:90%
or they're drawn to it.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, love is
very powerful thing

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and Lorrin just
was a ball of love.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And people just
started talking to me

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.404 align:middle line:84%
and telling me about
their experiences.

00:12:03.404 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And because I was
desperately searching,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I was asking anyone who would
listen how to help my child.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So I kept meeting people who
were gifted and communicating

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
telepathically or
energetically, and I just

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do what
they were doing.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know she could
do something special.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, well,
I'm a regular person.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an intuit.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And so if you-- you need to
communicate with me by blinking

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
or a thumbs up.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, it
was certainly blinking.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.376 align:middle line:90%
So I just started bribing her.

00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
You can have chocolate or
you can have green beans.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you blink, I'll
give you the chocolate.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- and a lot
of times, I think,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
she knew that I knew
what she wanted.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started
meditating and I started

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
listening to my
inner voice, and so

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.872 align:middle line:84%
she would look at me
knowing-- you know,

00:12:47.872 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:90%
she'd give me that kind of look.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.601 align:middle line:90%
You know what I want.

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
people at school won't know

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and other people that
aren't intuitive won't know,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
so you need to really
participate and communicating

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:90%
the best you can.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And it started with chocolate.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm shopping--
Lorrin loved fashion.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So certainly by the
age of five, she really

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:90%
had an opinion on fashion.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you know?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.028 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Well, it was really sad.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
One day we were at
the Disney Store.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you
know, loved Disney,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
so I was looking
at a Tigger outfit.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything was
Tigger and it was so cute.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing there and
I was just looking at her

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.552 align:middle line:84%
and she just-- just
blank, nothing.

00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, what's going on?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, you don't want this?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And she just kind
of looked at me.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.889 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, are
you too old for Tigger?

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:33.555 align:middle line:90%
And she blinked.

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:37.067 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, but
we just walked out.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of one
of those things where

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I was really glad that
she was communicating.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I was embarrassed
and I was like,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.333 align:middle line:84%
OK, then we just walked
and I just kind of had

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:90%
to sit with that.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think really
what she taught me

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the most is that everyone's
always communicating,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:90%
they just do it differently.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look
for those subtle signs.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.024 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wasn't
this big thing.

00:13:55.024 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It was just looking
at the subtle things

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.546 align:middle line:90%
that were happening.

00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But at
the same time, you

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
don't have to be born
with a gift of mediumship,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that you could actually develop
this sense of intuition,

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:90%
as did Lorrin.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:90%
She had-- this was her strength.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what she developed
because the other faculties

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:90%
were not available.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.497 align:middle line:84%
So she developed her strength
of intuition and then

00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that-- you followed
that lead and got

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.979 align:middle line:84%
a chance to develop
that with her.

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When did you start
communicating through dreams?

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.014 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: She communicated to
other people in dreams a lot,

00:14:29.014 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:90%
probably more clearly.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was probably
really sleep deprived.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So she was communicating
and other people

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:90%
would talk to me more.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started really
diving into meditation

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and quieting my voice
and really trying

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to just listen and then trust.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.482 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
everyone says, you know,

00:14:45.482 --> 00:14:47.637 align:middle line:84%
you think about that
person and the phone rings.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It was the
Celestine Prophecy time--

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -you know, in
'94, so I read that.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.425 align:middle line:84%
And I started
reading and started

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
meditating and I just-- I
knew other people could do it,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:90%
so I wanted to do it.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I just kept
practicing and then listening,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and asking her, you know,
and demanding of her,

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm feeling this way.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And she would look at me
or come from that end.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.654 align:middle line:84%
It was always-- it's
never cause and effect.

00:15:10.654 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
always simple, and I

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
think we have to be
really open when we go in

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:90%
to communicating with someone.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most important
thing is trusting my gut

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and taking care
of my spirit so I

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
can listen to what is
happening in my inner spirit.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, did she--
you said that she

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
was very strong into fashion.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So did she start to tell
you what she wanted?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.962 align:middle line:84%
We graduated out
of Tigger, so now--

00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
did she start to tell
you that she wanted

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.715 align:middle line:84%
to go to things like
school functions and dances

00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:43.715 align:middle line:90%
and wear pretty dresses?

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Did she tell you all that?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
As she became a young
teen, as she-- by the time

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
she was eight and nine,
I was much, much better.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.531 align:middle line:84%
It was really a process
of learning to let go.

00:15:56.531 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I had to, in the
very beginning, let

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
go of my dreams of being a
parent of a healthy child.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And that was devastating
for me, devastating.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- the more I resisted
things, the worse they got.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I just kept reading
and meditating and surrounding

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
myself with people who
were on the spiritual path.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think the strongest time
with me in an intuition time,

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we put her in a coma twice
to stop the seizures.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.295 align:middle line:90%
And that was very, very scary--

00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:24.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:24.795 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -because, I mean,
I just never thought

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:90%
that would be my kid.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Putting her in a coma to
stop-- to flatten her brain.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I was very scared.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I showed up with my drops
and aromatherapy, radio, all

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:90%
her cute blankets.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I sat by her side
and I did reflexology

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and I massaged her and did
oils, and just read to her

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:90%
and read to her and prayed.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it
was just an a-ha moment.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this kind of shift
and I don't know if I heard--

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.477 align:middle line:84%
I kind of am intuitive where
I just feel and I just know--

00:16:58.477 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I just
thought, OK, Lorrin.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to just accept
you the way you are.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.404 align:middle line:90%
I cannot fix you.

00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
You obviously aren't here
to be in a healthy body.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to quit expecting
you to be well and just

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:90%
love you the way you are.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready
to go, you can go.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.449 align:middle line:84%
And if you're here to stay,
I'll take care of you.

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.949 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I think on that day,
I became such a better partner

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:90%
to her.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.086 align:middle line:84%
Putting all that pressure
on her to get well when--

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And yourself.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And myself.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if she wasn't
feeling sorry for herself,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
who am I to feel
sorry for myself?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of a big step--

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: -for me.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was at three.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And she was
about nine years old?

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: No, that was at three.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.756 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Three years old, OK.

00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: So at three,
I kind of went on now.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.002 align:middle line:84%
But still, you know, it doesn't
mean that I woke up the next

00:17:45.002 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and everything's great.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I mean,
I still am human.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:90%
She's who she is.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still a
woman, a mother, and I

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
have ideas about how I
would like life to be.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.385 align:middle line:84%
And once I really just
kind of let go of that

00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and connect with
her, we just started

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
enjoying everything we could.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.415 align:middle line:90%
And part of that was shopping.

00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So I would take her
shopping and I would just

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
get everything out,
let her see everything,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and then encourage her to blink.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
If you want this,
you have to blink.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you knew
Lorrin, she loved fashion.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And we would do the Build A Bear
and with foods and with trips.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Any opportunity of something
she would love to do

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
was a great opportunity
for her to communicate.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was preparing her for
when she was away from me

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
at school, because
I wanted people

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
to be able to ask her
a question and then

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
her be able to
communicate with them.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if you see it,
then you believe it.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
a process with me.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And there were times, especially
as she was nine years old,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
she started liking
rap and all of that.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was just-- I was in the
car one day and I looked at her

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and I just had this
kind of a hint I guess.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.512 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you like rap?

00:18:46.512 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And she blinked and
kind of scowled at me

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.409 align:middle line:90%
and I was like oh, OK.

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So then I just started buying--

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course, I do.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.061 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yeah.

00:18:52.061 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I just started
buying her rap music,

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
but I always tried to
be age appropriate.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really, really important

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.687 align:middle line:90%
for parents to understand.

00:18:59.687 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times,
especially with kids

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
like Lorrin where
they're nonverbal

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're not mobile, we
really bring the world to them.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we-- I think
for me, if I'm

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
listening to Disney
her entire life,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.024 align:middle line:84%
I think she would
have just shut down.

00:19:14.024 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But I shifted, you know,
when she got out of Disney,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
then we-- you know, you just
shifted age appropriate.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
She was a teenager, so
she wanted the same things

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
all teenagers do and
that's the school dances.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:90%
She was in a beauty pageant.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And just keeping
the carrot out there

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
for fun and age
appropriate and stimuli

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
knowing that she can do
anything she wanted to do.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then she developed
great friends at school

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
as well, where the
other kids embraced her

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and invited her for
sleepovers and fun things

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.139 align:middle line:90%
like that as well?

00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: That was the best part.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:90%
That was the best part.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.375 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Well, we
started every January

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:90%
and we started setting goals.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because once I realized that
Lorrin had a soul agreement

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and I had a soul agreement
and we were together,

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
but she was here to do her thing
and I was here to do my thing.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was the able-bodied
person, so, of course,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I can make my stuff
happen all the time.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
respecting her

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and what she had
come here to do,

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that she was here to
be in a body that wasn't going

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to work, then I just kind
of let her do her thing.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I had my ideas
what I wanted to do.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.479 align:middle line:90%
So we'd sit in January.

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:20.228 align:middle line:84%
I would take her to
the beach and I'd just

00:20:20.228 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
bring pen and paper and
I'd pray and I'd meditate,

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was what do we want
to bring into our life?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we did the vision board,
but it starts with a goal.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'd write a couple
goals down, just a few.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.952 align:middle line:84%
Not a ton because it's crazy
to say all the things that I

00:20:34.952 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
wanted her to do.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
We just focused on what we were
going to make happen that year.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And friendships came up.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.342 align:middle line:84%
She had friends and she
had kids that were unique

00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:45.925 align:middle line:84%
and her cousins and
everything, but it

00:20:45.925 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
was like that best friend.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.217 align:middle line:84%
Every mother wants their kid
to have that best friend.

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And every kid, I think,
wants to have that friend.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:52.841 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.926 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: So we applied
for a service dog.

00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of work into
that and we got that

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.424 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like we
had won the lottery.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time
in middle school,

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
she had a nurse
named Debbie that

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
started going to
school with her.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And no one expected
Lorrin to go to school.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They all thought
that she would never

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:84%
show up because she
would be too sick.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
Lorrin and I said,

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you get sick
this year, they're

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
going to pull you out
of school and you're not

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
going to be able
to go every day.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they always
pull kids that

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are severely disabled
out of school

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:90%
during the cold and flu season.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you get sick,
you can't go to school

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.994 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to be
able to get friends this year.

00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:90%
So she kind of looked at me.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't miss
one day of school

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
that year for being sick.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I just told her, I
was like, you can't get sick.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And Debbie started
taking her to school.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
She went to school
every day with her.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I told Debbie, we
really want friendships.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.952 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and it's
all in the book.

00:21:41.952 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I worked really, really hard
with a bunch of teachers

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:90%
getting her in a regular class.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked the teacher
if we could have a party,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:90%
so we did that.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse came
home and she just said,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%
it's not really working.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
The kids aren't connecting.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a hard
age, middle school.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, give
me two more weeks.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So in that time, they
started a trimester.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the new trimester started
and Debbie took it upon herself

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and she got up in front of
school in the class and said,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:90%
this is Lorrin.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:90%
She has a vaccine injury.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:90%
She has brain damage.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:90%
She has seizures.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But she loves chocolate,
she loves shopping,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.054 align:middle line:84%
she loves Disney Channel,
and she loves everything.

00:22:18.054 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The same things
all the kids like.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all they want
to know is what does she do?

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:90%
How does she do it?

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is she like me?

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Exactly.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.399 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:24.399 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And adults.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:90%
We all are curious.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
So a boy said, can she walk?

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Can she talk?

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And then, can she see?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, not really.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And someone said, is she
the worst disabled kid ever?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.979 align:middle line:84%
And Debbie said, well
maybe at this school.

00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But come in her class
and you can say hello

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:90%
to her and her classmates.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And then on that day, two groups
of kids came in Lorrin's class

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and they came in every single
day for the next two years.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.432 align:middle line:90%
They came in before school.

00:22:49.432 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
They came in to see
what she was wearing,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:90%
to see if she was awake.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They came in at lunch and they
applied to work in her class.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And it just started
this huge thing.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And then my cell phone that
was for the 9-1-1 emergency

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
became the cute
question of the day.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So she started
calling me and saying,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
the kids want to know this and
they have all this questions.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.365 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
the kids want to know

00:23:10.365 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:90%
if she ever had a sleepover?

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:12.326 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they want one?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I think they do.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So the kids kind of just started
this relationship with Debbie.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:90%
And then we had a sleepover.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
another sleepover.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And it just was completely the
best part of Lorrin's life.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.656 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a picture
here of Lorrin in her--

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
in her dress, in her prom
dress, which is very beautiful.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was, you know,
a gorgeous floor

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to ceiling-- not floor to
ceiling, to the floor dress

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and she must have
had a wonderful time.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:90%
That was the prom dress?

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: This is her Quinceanera
dress, but she did go--

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, Quinceanera.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.009 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -she went to--
she went to a high school

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:90%
dance, the homecoming dance.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:90%
This was her Quinceanera dress.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.561 align:middle line:84%
And this is another time where
Lorrin in 2009 in January,

00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
she came to me in a
dream, and she told me

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:90%
she was ready to go.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I had made that
promise to her her whole life.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stay,
I'll take care of you.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.115 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready to
go, I'll make sure

00:24:02.115 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that you will be
comfortable and I'll

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
do everything I can for you.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.545 align:middle line:84%
And so it was always her
choice, and it took the pressure

00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:08.452 align:middle line:90%
off me.

00:24:08.452 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And we started doing
this about after she

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
was five, or three to
five, I'd always tell her

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you're really sick and if
this is your time, I'll be OK.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I always told her that.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And then in January, she
told me she was ready to go.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Before her 15th year?

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yes.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Three months before
her 15th birthday.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We were in ICU and she had
had a seizure for about a week

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't stop.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that
her body was changing.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But as a mother,
you know, I always

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
had hope and everybody
had been rallying for her

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and she just had
all these friends.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, I just sat
there and she blinked.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I made her blink 100 times.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're ready to go?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to die?

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.943 align:middle line:90%
You're going to leave your body?

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to make sure
that I understood her.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.432 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
thought, well, what

00:24:51.432 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:90%
are we going to do with this?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
focus on her dying,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and so we planned a
party for her birthday.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:90%
So we had 100 people.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And--

00:24:59.180 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -we just totally
focused on the celebration.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.044 align:middle line:84%
And I had a purple dress--
we went on the internet

00:25:05.044 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
because she was too sick
at that time to shop.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So I went on the internet
and I picked out a dress

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'd put Lorrin in her chair
and we'd get on the computer

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:90%
and we'd look and look and look.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: It was purple.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:90%
And Lorrin was just nothing.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was like
forcing, are you sure?

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:90%
You sure?

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And then one night,
I had a dream

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and I saw this big coral dress.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up and
I told Carissa,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's not
purple, it's coral.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So I called the bridal shop
and I said, we're coming in,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:90%
show me your coral dresses.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I just said show me
what you have in coral.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Lorrin picked
the most expensive dress,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and the most elaborate dress.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
just like, I knew.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- it was just one
of those little tiny things.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like
Lorrin was telling me

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.587 align:middle line:84%
the day she was going
to die or all of this--

00:25:48.587 --> 00:25:49.545 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The fun things.

00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: She was coaching me.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And she always--
if you were to say,

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.162 align:middle line:84%
did she always have a
positive outlook or spirit?

00:25:57.162 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: She was always happy.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Always happy.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: She was always loving.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:90%
She never complained.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
When she was sick, she
was sick, really sick,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and things were scary.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But when she was
better, she was on.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And she loved life.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
She loved being a girl.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:90%
She loved her friends.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.162 align:middle line:90%
And it's magical.

00:26:13.162 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a picture
here of one of her friends.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Is this one of her
friends from the school?

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: That's her best
friend, Sarah Rivera.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.557 align:middle line:84%
That is the person who just
changed her whole life.

00:26:23.557 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she made a lot
of different friends.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:84%
In her first sleepover,
there were five girls.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But Sarah and Lorrin really
connected for a long time.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.345 align:middle line:84%
And it's not anything
I could make up,

00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I just really set the tone
and allowed it to happen.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.739 align:middle line:84%
And one of the cutest stories in
middle school one time, Debbie

00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
went to school with
her all the time.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And Lorrin only breathed
out of the hole in her neck,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
so she very medically fragile
so she could occlude her airway

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
if she fell forward at any
time and it was very scary.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.044 align:middle line:84%
You just had to
be really on her.

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And one time Sarah
ran into school

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.417 align:middle line:84%
and she said, Debbie, I need
to talk to Lorrin by myself.

00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So Lorrin was sitting in
a sleeping bag and Debbie

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.184 align:middle line:84%
kind of backed
off just watching.

00:27:00.184 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And Sarah was over
there and she's

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:84%
talking and talking and
talking and they were about 12,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and Lorrin's blinking,
blinking, blinking.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And then they kind of
did whatever they had to do.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.473 align:middle line:84%
She left and she
said, thanks, Debbie.

00:27:10.473 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to talk to
her alone for a minute.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.779 align:middle line:84%

>>KAIN: Lorrin
traveled all over.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.356 align:middle line:84%

00:27:31.356 --> 00:27:32.105 align:middle line:90%
We went to Mexico.

We went to Canada.

We went to New York.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
-When I look at
Lorrin's soul agreement,

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
reasons why she came here

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and the reasons she picked
this body, and the reasons

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:84%
she did what she did, it
made a lot more sense to me.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because had she walked and
had she talked and had she not

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
been injured by the
vaccine, my life

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:84%
would have been
totally different.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
But because of all
those circumstances,

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
because I went
through so much pain

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
being her mother
in the early years,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I can sit with
someone else's pain.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I learned
about judgment,

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.275 align:middle line:84%
I really think I'm pretty
good at not passing judgment.

00:28:57.275 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And because I went
through so much turmoil

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
with her and so much
loss and, you know,

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I really felt that I
had lost everything

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that I ever hoped
my life would be.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can kind
of help any parent

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
with the keys of reminding
them that there's a great love

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that happens and there's a
great opportunity for growth.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
great-- a great joy

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that can be had in life
when your child isn't

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:84%
perfect or isn't normal
or comes out different.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:84%
If we could look at our
children and, if in prayer

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
or meditation, if we take
that moment and we reach

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
them and we ask them, what
did you come here to teach me?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
What are my lessons
in life about having

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
a child with a disability
or with 50 disabilities?

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, what am I to learn
about living in the hospital?

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I really just had to kind
of become an observer,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
as in watching a
movie and see things

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
how they were playing
out and decide

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:84%
what I was going
to take from that.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Was I going to change the
way I responded to people?

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Was I going to become more
compassionate towards people?

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Was I going to pass judgment?

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Or was I going to
grow and learn?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, when people wanted
to be spiritually educated,

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
they would go in a
monastery and they

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:90%
would spend 17, 20 years there.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It's my belief that my daughter
came here to teach spirituality

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and to teach love and to teach
compassion and forgiveness.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And my 15 years
with her was really

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
just an education of
a different thinking.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we're
coming to a world

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that we don't look at someone
like Lorrin and think,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:84%
you don't belong or
you're not in there

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:90%
or you're not important.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.999 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a time we
will look at all individuals

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and know that they're important,
and know that they are

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
teachers, and know that
they have spiritual reasons.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's very powerful.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very important
that we look at each other

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and know the every single
person's important.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was an honor
being Lorrin's mother, having

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
her teach me these
little bits and pieces.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.147 align:middle line:84%
And it couldn't
come the first year,

00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:16.730 align:middle line:84%
because the first
year I really wasn't

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
even able to deal with
anything except my feelings

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and my emotions and survival.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And it really didn't
even come the fifth year.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It basically has been just a
process of learning from her.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
we give ourselves

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to learn compassion,
it's a very powerful thing.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
She was teaching
other people, too.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It was another moment
that I had to realize

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't all about me.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Lorrin didn't come
here just to teach me.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:90%
She taught all kinds of people.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:84%
She actually would
teach anyone who

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
would show up to listen or
maybe to observe and give her

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:90%
a moment.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a quite
powerful thing for someone

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
to decide to come in a body
that was riddled with pain,

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
filled with drugs, that people
would basically reject her

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
just for being her because
they were afraid of her

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and afraid of the way she
looked and afraid that she had

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.420 align:middle line:84%
a trach, or they would make
fun of her for being different.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
This little girl chose
this body to teach people

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:90%
love and compassion.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, she has
my great respect.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
parents could understand

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.409 align:middle line:84%
that if your child happens
to be a little bit different,

00:32:25.409 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that they're
not going to be important.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But their job really
is even more important

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.170 align:middle line:84%
because they have the
courage to show up for us

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and they love us enough
to teach us strength

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and to teach us those lessons
in life that could possibly

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
be sometimes gentle lessons,
and sometimes really

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:90%
difficult lessons.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I hope this helps you
as a parent, a teacher,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
or a caregiver of someone
who's living a unique life

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.340 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Know that what you're
doing with your child

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful thing, and
our children who are unique

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:58.035 align:middle line:90%
are magnificent.

00:32:58.035 --> 00:33:09.787 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.953 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've certainly gained
an enormous amount of insights

00:33:12.953 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to share
some of-- you know,

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
if you could kind of
encapsulate some of your tips.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have a sheet
here of your tips.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:84%
These are spiritual
tips, but I just

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
want to ask you before
we go through those,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:90%
can you hear Lorrin now, today?

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you hear her throughout
your daily walking life?

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: I feel her all the time.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I hear her also, but I kind of
feel-- she told me one time,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.330 align:middle line:84%
she said, if I told
you everything,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:90%
it would take the surprise away.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.604 align:middle line:84%
So I try to just
ask for her energy.

00:33:45.604 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, sometimes
I'll be like,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.478 align:middle line:84%
you know, I need
help here, Lorrin,

00:33:48.478 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
or-- I know she's
in an amazing place.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.182 align:middle line:84%
I've never worried
about her ever.

00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Has she
communicated that to you?

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yes, yes.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.901 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I knew before.

00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:90%
She said--

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where is she?

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I think
she's everywhere.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.136 align:middle line:90%
I think she's everywhere.

00:34:00.136 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But when you say
she's in an amazing place,

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:90%
does she describe it?

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: She said
one time, clearly,

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.845 align:middle line:84%
she said, if you could
see what I see, mom.

00:34:08.845 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:84%
I think she was like--
and when she was here,

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I think she was in
a physical body,

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:84%
but I think she also
had the capacity

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to be in that spirit realm.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To travel, mm-hm.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Just to be completely
away from her body.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that about her,
so it would make me mad

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
that she had the capacity to
pull herself out of her body

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and then I would be
here caring for it.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, get
back in your body.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.332 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I know you're
out gallivanting,

00:34:31.332 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to
clean up this mess.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes things were a little
messy her last year of life.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the
most profound things she

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:84%
said to me recently when I was
at the AutismOne Conference,

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.360 align:middle line:84%
because that is-- my
heart is with children

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:90%
who are vaccine injured.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
All children-- all
children who are unique

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.679 align:middle line:84%
are here just to do exactly
what they're here to do.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, I'm
very sensitive speaking

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to children who are
vaccine injured.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm always asking
her, and usually she says,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:90%
make it fun, mom.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And that day, she said, mom,
tell them it was worth it.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And it just came
so clear to me--

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -and so strong and
it just-- that's Lorrin.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
She just is always
full of love and I

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:84%
want to really
remind parents first

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
to take care of themselves.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We can't do anything--
we can't be spiritual,

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:84%
we can't be good parents, we
can't be good to ourselves

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.490 align:middle line:84%
if we're exhausted and not
taking care of ourselves

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and everything falls apart.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.807 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's typically
what mothers don't do.

00:35:27.807 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: First, they
do everything else.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And because they think
that's-- and I did the same.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.685 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was a martyr.

00:35:33.685 --> 00:35:34.865 align:middle line:90%
I was beating myself up.

00:35:34.865 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I was exhausted and I
couldn't hold it together.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make life
and death decisions

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.054 align:middle line:84%
because I just-- I
was barely breathing.

00:35:41.054 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So I want to remind
parents and families

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
themselves first.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.346 align:middle line:90%
And make it fun.

00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You made an
interesting comment

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
before the show about 95%
of parents with children

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:84%
with disabilities
don't stay together.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a very high number.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:84%
What could you contribute
to allow that statistic

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.774 align:middle line:90%
to go down?

00:36:02.774 --> 00:36:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I think a
big part-- well,

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, grief-- everyone
grieves differently.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And kids, you
know, siblings and couples,

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:90%
we grieve differently.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
difficult thing,

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.851 align:middle line:84%
because typically we're
always somewhere else.

00:36:16.851 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how smart you are,

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.149 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter how educated
you are, or spiritual.

00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Everybody
does that differently.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I think communicating
and reminding

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that the couple,
the family together,

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.460 align:middle line:90%
has to be taken care of.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, especially
I did, everything was Lorrin.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.807 align:middle line:90%
Everything I did was Lorrin.

00:36:33.807 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And the coping skills?

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get married
and think that we

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
would be deciding if
we're going to pull

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:90%
the plug on my daughter.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.038 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: That is
not anything I ever

00:36:43.038 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:84%
thought I would be
making a decision on.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:90%
So-- and it's stressful.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I lived in the hospital
for two years with her.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It's high stress.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.659 align:middle line:90%
And not having rules.

00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And back then, there
was no internet.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get on
the internet and say,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:90%
does anybody feel like me?

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.406 align:middle line:84%
Now, at least there's
tons of families,

00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
there's tons of
parents out there

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.107 align:middle line:90%
connecting and supporting.

00:37:02.107 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
together because there's

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot more awareness
around it now.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the past, maybe the other
parent felt alone completely

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yeah.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's something that--
do you talk about this as well

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.329 align:middle line:84%
in the conferences when
you go to talk to--

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -the AutismOne
and so forth?

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.031 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I think first and foremost,
we take care of ourselves.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think then
it kind of opens

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.570 align:middle line:90%
the gateway for the intuition.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I always try
to remind parents

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that our children are here doing
exactly what they need to do.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And parenting children
who are unique

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
is the most important job
that you'll ever have.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
The Native American community
totally holds these kids up.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They know how important and
how magical these children are

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and how wise that they
came here to teach us.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Because with
Lorrin, I think, she

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.059 align:middle line:84%
came here to do a
really tough job.

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:49.475 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
would look at her

00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:51.308 align:middle line:84%
and say, why would you
ever want to do that?

00:37:51.308 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But look what she has
done and the power

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of her and her belief
in God and her faith

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to trust me as her mother and to
go out and be in the community.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm doing my half of
my soul agreement, I hope.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.096 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's more,
but that's my commitment

00:38:06.096 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to Lorrin because I
think she came here

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
to do exactly what
she needed to do.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.322 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is to communicate?

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: To communicate.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
To change, hopefully, the
vaccine program, the way we

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.120 align:middle line:90%
treat families.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.830 align:middle line:84%
To remind parents that children
who are unique are valuable.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Every soul is important,
no matter their ability.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
To remember that we
can look into the eyes

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.249 align:middle line:90%
and see the soul of somebody.

00:38:27.249 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to communicate.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to walk.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And to not discount any of us
because some are able-bodied

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and some aren't.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Everybody's important.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think creating
our own reality,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really had to
change my perspective when

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering and
I felt there was

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.820 align:middle line:84%
lack in Lorrin, that's
what I would get.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.525 align:middle line:84%
And when I accepted
her and saw that she

00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:52.390 align:middle line:84%
was perfect the way she was,
then I would see the magic.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And the more magic I felt,
because she always was magical,

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
then the more magic we
brought into our life.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.936 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was one of the
tips that you have here,

00:39:01.936 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:84%
is that the world
that we live in

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.979 align:middle line:84%
is a projection of
our own thoughts.

00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you
felt lack, then

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.670 align:middle line:84%
you would accept-- that's what
you would attract is lack.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.059 align:middle line:84%
And she taught you this
in some way, right?

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And my friend told me,
he says, if you ever

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.336 align:middle line:84%
wonder what you
believe, just look

00:39:21.336 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:84%
what you've surrounded
yourself with.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.623 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:23.623 --> 00:39:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: And I believe
that there's magic

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that I
can do anything I want.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, I'm here with
you talking about the story.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I just felt-- and I
felt very much as her parent,

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.200 align:middle line:90%
but I was in school.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like-- you
know, Lorrin always said,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:90%
like is but a coffee break, mom.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.544 align:middle line:90%
Get over yourself.

00:39:41.544 --> 00:39:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She said that?

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Oh, she was just
very whatever with me

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
because I was always drama.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:84%
She's just, you know,
get over it, mom.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Because she just had this
amazing belief and confidence

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.727 align:middle line:84%
and trust and she
always exuded that.

00:39:55.727 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That everything
was going to be all right?

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.492 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Mm-hm.

00:39:58.492 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, she still
loved fashion and chocolate

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to shop.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But she always-- she was so
loving, at her funeral someone

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
said it so perfectly that
Lorrin made people feel safe.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's so strange
because you really

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:90%
had to experience it.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And I knew when she
was crossing over,

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that would be what I
missed the most in my home.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I know she's still there
and all that, but just

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
walking into a house that is
filled with love and trust.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I just held
her up and just

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
really wanted to learn
everything I could from her.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt if you've
come here to be in this body

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting
up with all this,

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I need to really
learn my lessons

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:90%

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%

that-- those lessons

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:84%

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:90%

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.309 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot more that

00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: I'm learning every day.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.729 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -and I challenge
myself every day.

00:40:55.729 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- you know, Lorrin
certainly wants me to tell

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.024 align:middle line:84%
everybody that I was

I did a lot of things wrong.

I went in kicking and
screaming and crying.

without crying.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.950 align:middle line:84%

We have to know
that's true and we

Not with our minds and not

with our hearts

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.910 align:middle line:90%
and hearing these children.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.819 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, I look
at them all the time

00:42:39.819 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and I see their eyes and I see
into their soul and it's like,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
everything they're saying.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But I know they're
communicating.

>>LISA: So tell me a little
bit more, if you can,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%

she describes.

And you said that if you

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
you would understand
that she's fine.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Has she ever given you
descriptions of that

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
or feelings or anything that
you could communicate to us?

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: It-- a long time
ago when I would meditate,

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing this
bright, bright light.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that
she was showing me

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
her light, which
was also my light.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
She would just-- you
know, I would see this.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.955 align:middle line:84%
I would meditate
and I would just

00:43:24.955 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:84%
feel this enormous presence and
love and energy and perfection

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:90%
and just power.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And then she would
say, mom, this is you.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You see it in me because
this is who you are.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:35.520 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have had
times where I just

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.412 align:middle line:84%
feel this unbelievably powerful
feeling of love, of course.

00:43:41.412 --> 00:43:42.995 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
go, and it's like, I

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:90%
want that back, you know.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to be physical
here right now.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm still physical.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
When she comes in-- after she
died-- at first I just saw her.

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I
see her in my car

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.210 align:middle line:90%
and I yell at her in the car.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.126 align:middle line:84%
That's where I, like,
yell at her all the time

00:43:58.126 --> 00:44:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and just have that-- I yelled
at her when she was here, too.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like, just whatever it is.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Like mothers, just
like where are you?

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Or what are you doing?

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Or what's this about?

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Just like, I need a sign,
a big sign, you know.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I just always yelled
at her when she was here.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.713 align:middle line:90%
It was like, what are you doing?

00:44:12.713 --> 00:44:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We'd argue and she'd just look
or laugh or just roll her eyes

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.114 align:middle line:84%
at me, because I'm
very verbal, obviously.

00:44:19.114 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But she puts the fire
alarms off a lot,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and I asked her one time
before she died, I would just,

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, how will I
know where you are?

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, when you see love
and magic and light in nature,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.790 align:middle line:84%
in anything
beautiful, I am there.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's sweet and not very
specific, but I have to trust.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I have to-- I trust in her.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And so how do I--
where is she at now?

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.750 align:middle line:84%
She comes to me now and she
comes to me as a perfect

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.542 align:middle line:84%
person, a perfect body,
which really throws me off

00:44:52.542 --> 00:44:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's really hard
for me because I'm--

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Standing and--

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.113 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Just-- yeah.

00:44:56.113 --> 00:44:58.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of-- she comes to
people all the time dancing

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.859 align:middle line:84%
or ice skating, a
beautiful ballerina.

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes she
comes to different people,

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying to
a lot of different--

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
she'll come in eating all
kinds of different foods.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.065 align:middle line:84%
Like olives and chocolate and
this and just popping food.

00:45:09.065 --> 00:45:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I see her running around
all the time, just really busy.

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm meditating, she
comes in-- she'll come to me

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and she'll hold my hand and
she'll look into my eyes.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.074 align:middle line:84%
And she has a crooked eye,
and she just does this.

00:45:20.074 --> 00:45:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I know
it's like serious.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.146 align:middle line:90%

feel like when I sleep,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- because we
slept together all the time,

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.000 align:middle line:90%
so I feel her energy.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's more
of a feeling than a vision.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But when I do see see her
and she comes in perfect,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.169 align:middle line:90%
it throws me out of meditation.

00:45:36.169 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just say, I love that
you have this perfect body,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's hard for me
because like part of you

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.359 align:middle line:84%
was the crooked feet and the
eye crooked and the arms.

00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:90%
But she still comes in with it.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.774 align:middle line:84%
You know, she's going to
do what she's going to do.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.289 align:middle line:84%

I don't feel-- I feel like we
have many lives, or you know,

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.690 align:middle line:84%
she said really
they're parallel lives,

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.331 align:middle line:84%

confusing to really talk about.

>>LISA: No, it's actually not.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.530 align:middle line:84%
That is a question that I have

know the she's taken
care of me, absolutely.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Because I have no idea
what their soul journey is.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
their lesson is.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And who am I to say anything?

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I just say this is what I
did, and if it calls to you.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are we all
fulfilling that soul lesson?

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.772 align:middle line:84%
Are we all discovering
it as we go along?

00:47:15.772 --> 00:47:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I did-- I think
that's what we're here to do.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most important thing.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remind myself every day
because most of what I do now

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is communicate with families
and travel and talk to families,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:90%
and it takes a lot.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just remind myself,
life is but a coffee break.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I die, whether
it's tomorrow or today or 10

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.777 align:middle line:84%
years from now or
whatever, I just

00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:39.360 align:middle line:84%
want to look back
and just feel like I

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.620 align:middle line:90%
did what I came here to do.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's my soul purpose,
and in honor of her

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.880 align:middle line:90%
and all of our children.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And so what you came
here to do and when

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
you go to the conferences and
you speak at the AutismOne

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.195 align:middle line:84%
Conferences and write books
and in your second book

00:47:54.195 --> 00:47:58.920 align:middle line:84%
is more lessons, what is it that
you feel you are here to do?

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I think I'm
to remind parents

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:90%
that everybody's perfect.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:05.499 align:middle line:84%
The children are perfect
the way they came in.

00:48:05.499 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
For some reason
there's a lot-- well,

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:84%
right now, 50% of our
children have chronic illness.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I would love to be
part of that change.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I would like to learn a
lesson in an easier way.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I was so
unaware 20 years ago that I

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:21.360 align:middle line:84%
had to really learn this
lesson in very difficult ways.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.255 align:middle line:84%
It was very painful
letting go of what

00:48:23.255 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
going to be like.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And then acceptance.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So really I think I'm here to
remind parents if I can do it,

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.820 align:middle line:90%
anyone can do it.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Went through a really difficult
time and I'm still full of joy.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.740 align:middle line:84%
After she died, it took
a while, of course.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.852 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: And it's very difficult.

00:48:39.852 --> 00:48:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The physical touch
part is, as I can imagine,

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.269 align:middle line:90%
the most challenging--

00:48:44.269 --> 00:48:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Letting go.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:45.601 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:48:45.601 --> 00:48:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: But my faith tells me
that she's fine where she's at.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm here doing the work
that I agreed to do.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to do the
best job possible.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.059 align:middle line:84%
I miss her, but I don't feel
like she's ever far away.

00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I would love
to have her sitting here.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.183 align:middle line:84%
Then she would just want
me to be quiet, I'm sure,

00:49:00.183 --> 00:49:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and her talk.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to do my best
to communicate the message

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.832 align:middle line:84%
that she came here to teach, and
it's an honor and a privilege.

00:49:07.832 --> 00:49:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not the life I
thought I was going to have.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
it's a bad life.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.061 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: It's a good life.

00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It's an important life.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's an honor to be able
to be on the other side.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to remind parents
that you can get through it.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, let's talk a
little bit about the vaccines

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and do you coach
parents who are looking

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.160 align:middle line:90%
at vaccinating their children?

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Are you a voice in
that movement at all?

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: I used to-- I
used to say educate.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm a lot more concerned.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.510 align:middle line:84%
53% of our children
have chronic illness.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:45.760 align:middle line:84%
People do not understand
what is in the vaccinations.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.410 align:middle line:84%
We're giving our kids 49
vaccines by the age of five.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I talk to parents all over the
US and it's the same story.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 49 vaccines.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: 49 vaccines by the
time they're age of five.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.840 align:middle line:84%
That vaccine schedule
has never been tested.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Our kids are sick.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.550 align:middle line:90%
We have a huge rate of SIDS.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And another terrible-- a
couple terrible things.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I travel all over
and I meet families

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of more than one
vaccine injured child.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.041 align:middle line:90%
It used to be one.

00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.513 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -I was
speaking in Sacramento.

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:16.830 align:middle line:90%
There were 50 people there.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:84%
There were six families who
had multiple kids with vaccine

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:90%
injury.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.970 align:middle line:84%
We are-- pe-- the
drug companies are

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:90%
trying to take our choice away.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.750 align:middle line:84%
They're vaccinating
six vaccines at a time.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.895 align:middle line:84%
They're giving eight
vaccines into a little baby

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:90%
that you can't feed a banana.

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not tested.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:90%
The kids are sick.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a new thing that's
happening where there's

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.380 align:middle line:84%
a warning now to children who
are babysitting to not babysit

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:84%
after the kid has been given
a vaccine because parents are

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.590 align:middle line:84%
getting accused of
abusing their children.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:54.170 align:middle line:90%
This is becoming very rampant.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that again.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Well, the vaccine--
kids have vaccinations, right?

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They give them eight vaccines.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden something

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:90%
happens to the child--

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -and then the
child gets brain damaged.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the parents
are being blamed

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.000 align:middle line:90%
for shaken baby or something.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is becoming
a new epidemic

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:84%
of parents being accused
of abusing their children.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As you had
experienced a little bit of.

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.289 align:middle line:84%
They actually tried
to blame it on you?

00:51:17.289 --> 00:51:17.830 align:middle line:90%
The seizures?

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: No, they didn't.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.069 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:21.334 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in
a doctor's office

00:51:21.334 --> 00:51:22.500 align:middle line:90%
two hours after the vaccine.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: But this
is sometimes where

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.297 align:middle line:84%
it happens days later or hours
later where all of a sudden

00:51:27.297 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a healthy
baby, and then they come

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.963 align:middle line:84%
and the baby is really
sick or brain injured

00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:33.477 align:middle line:84%
and the government is
blaming the parents.

00:51:33.477 --> 00:51:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The parents.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Or the
babysitter or anybody.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:41.149 align:middle line:84%
And so parents are getting
arrested for abusing their kid.

00:51:41.149 --> 00:51:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Yeah, it's crazy.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.269 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:43.269 --> 00:51:45.989 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do instead?

00:51:45.989 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: Well, I think
we need to figure out

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:84%
why we're giving
so many vaccines

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and why are we doing a hepatitis
B vaccine the first day of life

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and is that necessary?

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it is.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't give six
vaccines to anybody.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And to really look at
it, it's just a fear.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.147 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors are
bullying parents.

00:52:02.147 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was different
when we were young.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.527 align:middle line:84%
There was only about five
or six when we were young--

00:52:06.527 --> 00:52:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Maybe five or six, yeah.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -adults-- that
adults went through.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.610 align:middle line:90%
And now there's almost 50.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Right.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.720 align:middle line:84%
There's 49 vaccines now and,
of course, they want more.

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're not liable for
what happens to the kids

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors
are kicking parents

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.540 align:middle line:90%
out for not vaccinating them.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you,
I see healthy babies--

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the healthiest babies I see are
breastfed and not vaccinated,

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.902 align:middle line:90%
and they're thriving.

00:52:31.902 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And the kids that are
vaccinated have the same story.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:84%
They were vaccinated,
then they get sick,

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and then they're on
antibiotics, and more vaccines,

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:90%
more antibiotics.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The doctor keeps telling the
parents that this is fine,

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
they're really sick.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's also
the emotional disorders.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.694 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that this is linked,

00:52:47.694 --> 00:52:50.520 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't necessarily
have to be infections.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:55.570 align:middle line:84%
It could be anxiety, depression,
schizophrenia, anything

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with emotional
or mental disorders as well.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I have read that
there are links,

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but there isn't-- there's no
way to be able to prove anything

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.310 align:middle line:90%
like that at this point.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: We have-- we
have a sick society,

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.204 align:middle line:90%
and this is a huge concern.

00:53:09.204 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We have 1 in 68
children with autism,

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and that's a very low figure.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more than that.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Our kids have diabetes,
they have chronic illness,

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.960 align:middle line:90%
they have seizures, asthma.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, even if there's
no way to directly link

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:27.141 align:middle line:84%
and if there is-- because
it's-- there's no emphasis

00:53:27.141 --> 00:53:29.640 align:middle line:84%
on the direct link, there's not
enough research that's being

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.820 align:middle line:84%
done about it, those
studies won't be funded.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that we
can do is to raise awareness

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and to do your own research.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.029 align:middle line:84%
And you have brought
that for the one person

00:53:40.029 --> 00:53:42.070 align:middle line:84%
that has never heard of
this before in their life

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing this show
right now for the first time,

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.170 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go tell
someone else watch this.

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this lady
before you consider

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:90%
vaccinating your child.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Do your research,
ask your doctor,

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:55.300 align:middle line:84%
find a doctor who
doesn't vaccinate and see

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:90%
what their opinions are.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There's so much--
there's such a long road

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go on,
which is a very good road.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:02.989 align:middle line:90%
It's a much needed road.

00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Absolutely.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Much needed.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: We're putting toxins
into our kids and our kids are

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.858 align:middle line:84%
sick, and then everyone is
was walking around blaming

00:54:08.858 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
the parent or-- you know,
it's always back to blaming

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.299 align:middle line:90%
the parent and--

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: -we need to start really
raising awareness and talking

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.940 align:middle line:84%
about it and demanding
research to be done.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I want
to end on the note

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:84%
of a few of the spiritual
tips that you do tell us

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
gathered from all this.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have so much
more to say, but one of them

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is each soul has something
to contribute, yes?

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Make it fun.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.390 align:middle line:84%
What you do on an
individual level

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:84%
affects your surrounding,
your children.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about that as
much, but what do you mean?

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.724 align:middle line:84%
What you do with
yourself affects--

00:54:43.724 --> 00:54:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: I think everything--

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
mirroring constantly.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAIN: How we feel and
who we are, And it's

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.270 align:middle line:84%
like all the little things
kind of make up the big things.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm walking around
really angry and unloving,

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure my child or
anybody doesn't really

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.810 align:middle line:90%
want to be around me.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:54:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.246 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:00.246 --> 00:55:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
the world that we

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.780 align:middle line:84%
live in is a projection
of our own thoughts.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And finally, that we're part
of a greater whole connected

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in a fundamental way, and
what I do to you affects me.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is a beautiful
way to live your life,

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.910 align:middle line:90%
even if you have a child or not.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:21.660 align:middle line:84%
What I do affects
you and affects me.

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's a beautiful
way to wrap up.

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:26.040 align:middle line:90%
You're amazing.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.761 align:middle line:90%
I could talk to you forever.

00:55:27.761 --> 00:55:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Thank you.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.218 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you for
being so courageous

00:55:30.218 --> 00:55:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and being such an inspiration.

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:32.680 align:middle line:90%
You're incredible.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KAIN: Thank you.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.439 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:33.439 --> 00:55:34.182 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:55:34.182 --> 00:55:35.640 align:middle line:84%
