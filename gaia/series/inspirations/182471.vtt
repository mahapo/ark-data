>>LISA GARR: Have
you heard the phrase,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:84%
you can create your own reality,
or the law of attraction?

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
What does that really mean
on a quantum physics level?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:84%
As fast as the
world is changing,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be helpful to
learn new ways of thinking

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and how to think
on a quantum level?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Joining me to break this
down in relatable terms

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:90%
is physicist Dr. Fred Alan Wolf.

Dr. Quantum, as he's
affectionately called,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
he has the unique ability to
communicate the complex topics

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics into
more understandable terms,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%

Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:59.337 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:10%
It's a pleasure to
be on this show.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:10%

>>LISA: Well, I'm really
excited to have you here.

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:10%
So can you tell us how
quantum physics can

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:10%
help us understand the rapid
changes that we're experiencing

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.792 align:middle line:10%
in the world today?

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:10%
Help us cope with it
a little bit better.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:10%
>>WOLF: OK.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:10%
I'll try.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have to try
to grasp, what is this thing

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.372 align:middle line:90%
called quantum physics?

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't mind, I'm going
to paint a kind of picture.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Tell you a little bit of a
story, if that's OK with you.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: All right.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, when we
first came out of the caves

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and the uga-boogas were all
around us, we needed something.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
We were afraid.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were going to be--

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survival.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:10%
So we started trying
to figure out,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:10%
what is this thing we're in,
this nature that we're in?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And as the years went by,
we began to see, well,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:10%
we can control fire.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:90%
We can control air.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:90%
We can control water.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We began to learn about the
nature of things by the things

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that we could get our mitts
on, how we control them.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're going to
jump thousands of years.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And as we jump
thousands of years,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
we get into a kind of
mechanical world view.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is a world
view in which everything

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%
is viewed as being mechanical.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a machine.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
We have a little bit
of that even today,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
in today's thinking, which I
don't necessarily subscribe to.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
that was the thinking

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
during the time of Newton
and Galileo and Bruno,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and a number of
people who were around

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:90%
during this period of time.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Descartes.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I won't get into all that.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But all I want to
get into with you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that since
everything was a machine,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
we looked at things
mechanically.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.738 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
do with machines?

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take them
apart, and you put them

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:90%
back together again.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing
is, can we take apart

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
the universe or the
things we have around us

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and put them back
together again?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, pretty well.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
We did very well until about
the turn of the 20th century.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we began taking
things apart so well

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that when we tried to put
them back together again,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
they didn't fit.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Nothing made any sense.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We needed a kind of
new physics, a new way

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to bring things
back together again.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.583 align:middle line:84%
And that gave us
some way of thinking,

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:90%
a new way of thinking.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.493 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are we
actually trying

00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%
to build in the first place?

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
What are the things
we've taken apart?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
What are the things we're trying
to put back together again?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And what arose from all
that was a picture of things

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
being atoms and molecules
and then electrons.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we began to even take
apart the nucleus of atoms.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we have pictures
of quarks and anti-quarks

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and gluons.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.363 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:56.363 --> 00:03:56.736 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.536 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: We're so much
into thingyness, so much

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
into taking things apart,
so much into things

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:90%
have to be really thingy.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics keeps going
and waving its finger at us

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to say, (SINGING) na,
na, na, na, na, na, you

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:90%
don't have it right yet.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the
case, because it's not

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:90%
a question of thingyness.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.847 align:middle line:90%
It's more a question of mind.

00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to see
what quantum physics is

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
telling us is that things
are not made of things.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They're made of what we
think they are made of.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what we
think things are made of,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
trying to build a picture which
is consistent with what we more

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
or less think we
understand leads us

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
into the whole picture
of pictures of atoms

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
as being little marbles.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.008 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I like that
so much better,

00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
because you say
you like machines

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to take apart and put
back together again,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.675 align:middle line:90%
and scientists do that.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm the type of
person that wants

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:90%
to push it and make it work.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
I just want it to work.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the world's
like that, especially

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
now in this day and age.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:10%
So it's interesting, because
there's a combination of two.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Pushing it and make it work
is kind of the quantum.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, underlying
the technology of today,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
including the filming
of this show--

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but the word filming is no
longer the right word anymore.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
been done is done

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of kind of
pictures that are really not

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
pictures or dots, pixels.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting into the whole
idea of quantum dots, quantum

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
pictures.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything has been pixelated
into small and small, small

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and smaller things.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're dealing
with no longer thinking this

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
as much as we are with idea-like
substance, idea-like things.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They're not really things,
but idea-like things,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
which turn into virtual
reality, television

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.237 align:middle line:84%
shows right now where the
picture you see on the screen

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is even brighter than the
picture you see when you

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
walk outside of your own house.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And it's just
amazing how we are

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
into creating our own reality.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
quantum physics has led us.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we began to
realize what it was telling us

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and we began to let go of
marbles and billiard balls

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- which are OK if
you're playing with marbles

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:90%
and billiard balls.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But while we're playing
with pictures and ideas

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence and
artificial intelligence

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of pixellation that
goes into making a television

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
show like this one,
we're no longer

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
dealing with marbles
and billiard balls.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
quantum comes into view,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
makes your desire

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to have it come
into view by pushing

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
that button become what it is.

00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture I
had the other day.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
We're like blobs.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
We're big blobs,
and we have a thumb.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:90%
And the thumb is on a screen.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We press the screen,
and the pictures appear,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and the blob goes--

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING NONSENSE]

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And we press the button again.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now I don't like that.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll press the button again.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.115 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
changing because we're

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:90%
controlling our reality.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're learning more and
more from our technology

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.817 align:middle line:84%
what it means to
create our own reality.

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is such great news.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
This is such great news from a
physicist that what we're doing

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:90%
is working now.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can work with
it more than ever.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And we're
just at the bottom

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
rung of what that means to
create your own reality.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Physicists could see it
happening in experiments

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that they did, but
these were experiments.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
These were very technical,
very difficult to explain

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:90%
in a layman's term.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it
is the same thing.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It is creating your own reality,
and we saw it happening.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we no longer
have pictures--

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we deal
with quantum physics,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
we're not dealing, as I said
before, we're thingyness.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
idea-like things.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Concepts, right?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Concepts.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Right.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So if you're
in a situation-- say

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:10%
you're going down
a specific track

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:10%
or there's things that are
happening in your life,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:10%
you don't necessarily like them,
can you use quantum physics

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:10%
to really jump into
a different reality,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:10%
to create on a different level,
and not create the same story

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:10%
over and over?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The thing
which is interesting is

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing that, even
though we don't recognize

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing that.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The thought or
the idea which has

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
you frozen in a
particular way of thinking

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
is being created,
recreated, recreated.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
It becomes re-creation,
recreation.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It becomes your way of dealing.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're so much caught
in that circle or that web

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of entanglement which keeps
you making the things appear

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you feel
most comfortable with, even

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
though what you
call comfort for you

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.645 align:middle line:90%
may be hell for somebody else.

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:90%
We're constantly doing that.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And then we can work together.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
We're not only just individuals.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:90%
We can share reality.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And each time we share reality,
the reality that I'm in

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and the reality that you're in,
even though we're sharing it,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:90%
it's not the same.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
We're in different
realities even right now.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem like it.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We may have
things in common,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.677 align:middle line:84%
but we have totally
different realities.

00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: We agree to
have things in common.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's what we agree on that
makes a universe appear

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to us as being out
there, independent of us.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But it never has been out
there, independent of us.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:90%
We're creating it all the time.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And the habits we
get into by the way

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
we do that creation creates the
situations we're in right now,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.613 align:middle line:84%
including all the chaos that's
going on in the world today.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
such an interesting--

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.638 align:middle line:90%
so let's take two examples.

00:10:15.638 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
One's going to be simple, and
one's going to be more complex.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:90%
So take an example of a red car.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.992 align:middle line:84%
And you see the red car,
and I see the red car.

00:10:22.992 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And the red car's on
television, and somebody's

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
advertising the red car, so
a collective group of people

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:90%
see the red car.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Does the red car really exist?

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It exists
in the way it's

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:84%
being observed by
every individual,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the same red car.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Could be slightly
purple to someone.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: In fact, the
red car that you see--

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
if we were to map out the
wavelength range over what

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
you call red, that you
call your red vision

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and compare it with
mine, you would

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
see that we're not
seeing the same red.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Even red is different.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
The sounds we make--

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:84%
as I get older, my ability
to hear high-frequency sounds

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
has diminished quite a bit, so
I don't hear the same sounds

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:90%
that I did when I was younger.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different perspectives.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So my reality of
sound, my sound reality

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.995 align:middle line:84%
is very different from,
say, your sound reality.

00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:19.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Because you're
much younger than I am.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's different
perspectives, different-- yeah.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's a perspective.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's also how we allow
the processes which

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:90%
are taking place to occur.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.023 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
mysteries here.

00:11:38.023 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say I've
got everything explained.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's quantum physics.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But there's
still big mysteries

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
that need to be explained.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then we go to the
more complex example, which

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is chaos where
we're experiencing

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
the news or the politics
or different things that

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
are being said.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a different
perspective on that.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
However, events
are still occurring

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that are being observed
by the collective

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
where you see a natural
disaster or you see a war zone.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Those are being experienced
by the collective,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
so they're actually
happening, right?

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: They are.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We are seeing them.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But the extent of those pictures
and how much they are actually

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
occurring in contrast
to the rest of the world

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
or the rest of even that
state or the rest of even

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that country is
still a small part.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It's devastating
that we're seeing it,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
but we're seeing
it much enlarged.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it
much more exploded,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and so we are more affected
by the vision of it.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But you would think that
would make us care more,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
but it also has the
opposite effect.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It makes us more
indifferent to it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.397 align:middle line:84%
It's so much that, oh,
well, you know, all right.

00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
So another guy got killed.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And that is also occurring.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.147 align:middle line:90%
So we're getting into--

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
some people are more
caring, but some people

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
are quite more indifferent, just
because we see it every day.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so here's
where I'm going with this.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Can we change it?

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: We can change it.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite clear how
to go about changing it.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Darn.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: So--

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Get on it.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:90%
We've got to figure this out.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.317 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But the one thing is
that the way I would change it,

00:13:25.317 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the way I believe
we have to change it

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is through compassionate
understanding.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And that means instead of
looking at the person that

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
has a viewpoint opposite
to you as being an enemy,

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
you look at it as,
how can I understand

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:90%
that person's point of view?

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Can I put myself into that
person's point of view?

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Just the thought of being
in another person's shoes

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and looking out through their
eyes with the understanding

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that they're not enemy,
but they're actually

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to see the world, see
the world as they see it,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to see the
world as they see

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
it will give you
a more compassion

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
what is going on.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unless that person is
doing something to harm you,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
then it's hard to
have compassion.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: You know, it
works even if somebody

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:90%
is trying to harm you.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is bigger than just
only one thing, but not this.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You can be compassionate
for this, but not for that.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is bigger
than all that.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And the big thing that
quantum physics tells me

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is that reality is
observer-created.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So we are creating
reality through the way

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:90%
we go about observing.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you can change the
way you observe somebody

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
who is antagonistic
to you, you can

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
change your way of looking
at that person, that person's

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:90%
viewpoint can also change.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They're opportunity because
see, there's the illusion

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.375 align:middle line:84%
that we're each separate kind
of minds, but we're really not.

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
We're really not that separate.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a field
of mind, a mind field.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And each of us through
the participation,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
through all the various
different mechanisms

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that come into
evolutionary wisdom

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have called
bodies, we have

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
produced an illusion
of separateness,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:90%
but we're really one.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.542 align:middle line:10%
I love this slide
that you have about

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:10%
that quantum physics
is like a wave.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:10%
And as you just explained,
you can either ride it,

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:10%
or you can resist it.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said is
a perfect example of that.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
You can ride the
wave of consciousness

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and be the observer
and the observed,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and really be a part
of this quantum soup.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can fight it and resist
it, and then what happens?

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, you get
washed to the side.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or suffer.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.455 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Unfortunately,
you suffer

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
more than you need to suffer.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot of
people are doing right now.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So true.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.625 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is true.

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So how then do you
really understand and go

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
on to the top of
that wave, Fred?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And how do you go with the
flow of quantum physics?

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The only way I know is
through compassion, that one

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
has to develop a compassionate
way of being in the world

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
with everybody that you
come in contact with.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what the situation
you are finding yourself in,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
you become compassionate
with the situation.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way I
know of dealing with it.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there is another
way of dealing with it.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I love your perspective
on compassion,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and I love your perspective on
how we can leap into compassion

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and become the observer
all at the same time.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to learn
about this next slide

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that you have on something
called complementarity?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.728 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Complementarity, yes.

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.312 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a
little bit about it.

00:17:09.312 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful concept.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that how and
what you choose to observe,

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
how you go about
making the observation,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics has
shown us that when

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:84%
we go about making
an observation,

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
the way we choose to
make that observation

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
creates a reality for us at
that moment, which is cut off,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
chopped off from all of
reality, other than just

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that particular
moment of observation.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
If we decided to
do that observation

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:84%
from a different perspective,
not trying to pin it down, not

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
make it into thing, but make it
into something complementarity

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to thingness, which would
be compassion, for example,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
then we go into
that mode of seeing.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And once we're in
that mode of seeing,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the choppiness into particleness
or into little objects

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:90%
is no longer present.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They're complementary to each
other, wave and particle.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Get on the wave, you're
not on the particle.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Get on the particle,
you've lost the wave.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole idea
of what the principle

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
of complementarity
is really all about.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to exist
in many, many places.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:90%
It's in our thinking.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We more or less intuitively know
what things are complementary

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.615 align:middle line:90%
and what things are not.

00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Jungian psychology was one
of the first to develop,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, a way of
thinking about that

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:90%
in terms of Jungian functions.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.415 align:middle line:84%
This is psychological
talk, I know, but we can--

00:18:59.415 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do
you mean by that?

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.095 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: I'll get into that.

00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
There are four basic functions
of mind, according to Jung.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Feeling, thinking,
sensing, intuiting.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
These are the four functions.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And Jung often
noticed that people

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
seem to be developed more
or less with two of the four

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:90%
strong and two of the four weak.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, it's
been suggested,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
although it's not
true today, but it

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:84%
used to be suggested that
women were feeling intuitives

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.247 align:middle line:90%
and men were sensing thinkers.

00:19:45.247 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
(GRUFF VOICE) I want to
know what this is made of.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.197 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:48.197 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I've got to
think about it somewhat.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Whereas women,
intuitively, well, they

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:90%
can see into the future.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
They kind of feel
their way through it.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.463 align:middle line:90%
They're feelers.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Doesn't
really matter what

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.047 align:middle line:84%
it's made of, as long as
you have a good time on it.

00:20:01.047 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So sometimes
we've isolated and called

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that the feminine versus
masculine point of view.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But today, there
are plenty of women

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:84%
that are quite adept
at sensing and thinking

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and quite a few men that
are feeling intuitives.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the things have
kind of switched around.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a question of sex
that determines these things.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of choice
and how one behaves.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would even
say that there are

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:90%
many of us that have all four.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: There are.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing about them

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is that they are in
complementary pairs.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:84%
You can more or less feel
and intuit at the same time,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:84%
but you can't feel and
think at the same time.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
You could try, but the
minute you start thinking,

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.275 align:middle line:90%
your feelings go out.

00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I use the analogy
of making love.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
You're making love and you're
having a wonderful time.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The feelings are whatever,
senses and feeling.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you think about,
oh, this is a wonderful thing.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
[GASP]

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And it suddenly stops because
you put it into thought.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That happens with
intuition and meditation.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
You can go have a great journey,
and then all of the sudden,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of
the body and you--

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --get sucked back.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the complementarity
that we are used to.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
We're used to it.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's where
these old cliches

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
about feeling and intuiting
versus sensing and thinking

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:90%
began to develop.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're used to the
concept of complementarity.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we find that it's not
only true for the way the mind

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and the body work,
but it also is

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:90%
true for principles of physics.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's really
about the observer,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's about perspectives,
again, I'm going to say.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But perspectives
isn't a word that's

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
used a lot in quantum
physics, is it?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, it is
in a certain sense.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.475 align:middle line:90%
It's what you bring to bear.

00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The perspective you take depends
on how you go about looking.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So how you decide to look at
that particular whatever, how

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:10%
you choose to observe
is called a perspective.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:10%
And you can imagine
up a picture where

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:10%
you're looking up
at a structure,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:10%
and it looks a certain way.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
From another point of
view, you're looking down,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:90%
it looks very different.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So these are different
perspectives.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you're looking, say,
from above like in a city,

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
looking down at a
big city, you're

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
getting a perspective
of the whole.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
individuals that you see

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.445 align:middle line:90%
look more like ants to you.

00:22:34.445 --> 00:22:35.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:35.245 --> 00:22:36.745 align:middle line:84%
Like from an
airplane's perspective.

00:22:36.745 --> 00:22:38.328 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's do this
little experiment.

00:22:38.328 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
great slide here

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that shows us
different perspectives.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: OK.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I love this.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.413 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain this to us?

00:22:44.413 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: What you
see on the screen

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
before you is what
you might call a box.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can see there are
two definite square faces

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
to the box.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:10%
There's a square face which
you might say is in front,

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:10%
and a square face which you
might say is in the rear.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:10%
Or you might look
at it another way.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:10%
There's a square face which
is lower than the square face

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:10%
which is a little bit higher.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:10%
But look at that
box for a while.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:10%
Let your mind sink
into it for a while,

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:10%
and then try to decide
which of those square faces

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:10%
is actually in
front of the other.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:10%
Is it the lower one in front
or the upper one in front?

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:10%
And for some people who are--

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I would call them more
sensing, thinker types--

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:10%
it gets frozen one way or the
other, and doesn't ever change.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But for intuitive feeling
types, it starts to jump.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's fluid.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It jumps.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It actually goes, dap,
dap, dap, dap, dap, dap.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch that, if you're
watching it on home right now,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
if you're watching
it right now, you

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.648 align:middle line:84%
can find out what you are
by watching that picture

00:23:49.648 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and seeing what happens to you.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.515 align:middle line:10%
I see the box fluid, coming
in and out, in and out.

00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:55.315 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:90%
In and out.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Fluid is more or less a flow.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:90%
This is pop!

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Pop!

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Pop!

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It's quantum leap.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a jump.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like pixelated.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like quantum dots.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It's digitized.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not smooth, flowing.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:90%
It's pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I call them pops, quantum pops.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And that's
what you're observing.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is, let's
say that you are seeing it

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
as a popping cube.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:84%
You're witnessing what would
be called a visual presentation

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:90%
of a quantum leap.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: This is what a
quantum leap is all about.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Now there's another
way of seeing this.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go to
a pure red screen.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: OK.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Now we're looking just red, OK?

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Now suddenly we see
a blue square, OK?

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Focus your mind on
that blue square.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Now a blue trapezoid appears.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe another blue trapezoid,
and then a third one,

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and then a fourth one.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a
bunch of trapezoids

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:90%
surrounding a square.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Focus your mind on all of those
as we change the background

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
from red to blue, but
only keep your mind

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
on the actual
geometrical flat figures

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned to you before.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And now even though
the background

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
may have changed
blue, you're still

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
focusing on just
those flat pieces.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
There is no jumping.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:84%
You're now in the
complementary space.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:84%
All you're seeing is flat pieces
pasted with a kind of red halo

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:90%
glowing around it.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Just focus on it that way.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're ready,
just say to yourself, jump.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you
say jump, suddenly

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:90%
it changes back into a cube.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.563 align:middle line:84%
And there it is doing its
jumping back and forth.

00:25:52.563 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is how
we can do this in life.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We can change our
perspectives that fast.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:90%
This is so important.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:10%
It's important for shifting
into different states

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:10%
of being, knowledge,
parallel universes,

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:10%
creating, creating
our own reality,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:10%
law of attraction, all of that.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the quantum
physics of it.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of focusing
in or unfocusing and looking

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:90%
at the whole picture.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And those are complementary.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can look
at any situation,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and you can see a quantum
jump from that situation.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
How does this work with
parallel realities?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
cube again, OK?

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The notion that
there's a quantum leap

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
can be looked at as me saying
that in parallel worlds,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
there are really
two perspectives.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you quantum
leap, in a sense,

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of jumping from one
world into a parallel world.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But you're going with
it, so you don't really

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
notice that anything
has changed,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because more or less,
everything else around you

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:90%
has kind of stayed the same.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at that
from a point of view.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you can merge
the parallel worlds

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
when you see just the blue
pieces on the red background.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you're looking at the
parallel worlds merged.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:90%
But the minute you go into--

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.530 align:middle line:90%
your jumping.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And every time you take
an option to choose

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:84%
one or the other or have one
or the other appear before you,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:84%
you've entered into
a parallel reality.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And we do this so much
that we don't even

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:84%
think of it in terms
of parallel realities.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics
has indicated to us

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that that is a way of
looking at what's going on.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
way of looking.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to necessarily
look at it that way,

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
but it may be
helpful to understand

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that each of us by
the choices we make

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
enter into our own realities
parallel with others

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:84%
where there's some agreement
as to what we can agree on.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And we may be able to
understand why there's

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:84%
so much disagreement
when we understand

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.165 align:middle line:84%
that we are looking at things
from different perspectives.

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Different universes,
practically.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Universes.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.717 align:middle line:84%
And there's an infinite
amount of them, right?

00:28:24.717 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: There's no ending.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.217 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
important part.

00:28:27.217 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So if there's an infinite
amount of parallel universes,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you and I could have a
conversation right here, right

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:84%
now, and then we can,
in a parallel universe,

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:84%
make a different choice,
a different decision,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and we will continue on
a different decision.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Say we decide to get
up and leave right now.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.535 align:middle line:84%
Yet there could
be this interview

00:28:45.535 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:84%
still happening in
a different reality?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Well--

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
--it's true, but the question
of how close those realities are

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to each other is so vast that
in each reality, the one where

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we separated from
each other, would

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:84%
be so distinct from the
ones where we're still

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
in conversation that we would
not notice that we left,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:90%
that we had the other option.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Once that option is made
on such a grand scale

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
as the scale of having
this show and doing

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.860 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing
right now, we wouldn't

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:90%
be able to see the connection.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
we do experiments

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:84%
where we really nibble down
to very fine distinctions,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's there that we can
see these parallel realities.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't really see them
very well in large--

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
what I call macroscopic.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do you do it in
a micro way in quantum physics?

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:90%
What types of studies?

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.405 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that's an
interesting question.

00:29:47.405 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's see if I can try
to explain it as best I can.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When you make an observation,
let's say of the cube--

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say we do
that observation.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:10%
One way of looking at that
is an observation is made,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:10%
and you see the cube with
the lower face in front

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.800 align:middle line:10%
and the upper face behind.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you had seen it
the other way around,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
you would see it with the upper
face in front and the lower

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:90%
face behind.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that those are
two parallel worlds,

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're in each
of those worlds.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that for a moment.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And now imagine that
your consciousness

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is able to grasp that both
pictures are possible,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:39.815 align:middle line:84%
and sees yourself holding onto
both pictures at the same time.

00:30:39.815 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like if they
were side by side.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: As if they
were side by side.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine that
you could see that.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Now imagine,
if you will,

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that you are able
to communicate what

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
you see to each of
your other alter egos

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:90%
in each of the parallel worlds.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the world where you're
seeing lower face in front,

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:90%
you're telling yourself, hey.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:84%
There's another viewpoint
that's also being seen.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know that.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:90%
There's another world.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's another
way of looking at this.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Hey, wait a minute.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I can change.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:90%
And you do that in both worlds.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the quantum
physics experiment,

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
we do something similar
to what I just described

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:90%
with atoms or molecules.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's more tricky.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we do it with what I
call qubits, quantum computers.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult--
it's more technical

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:90%
than I think we can get into.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's that
idea of communicating

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:84%
what is seen from the outside
to the individuals that are

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:90%
in the inside points of view.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they
have a memory,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
a memory of what is possible,
even though for them it's

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:90%
not possible.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't think it's possible.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But now they know
it is possible,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
because another
point of view exists.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's been introduced.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And that's
something we have

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.197 align:middle line:84%
to do in the reality
we're in right now.

00:32:07.197 --> 00:32:07.997 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:07.997 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Even though we
don't see it as possible,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
we have to-- that's what
I mean about compassion.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You begin to open up yourself
to the other point of view that

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is possible, even though you
don't have that view right now.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
There's another
voice telling you,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's possible.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's possible.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And this means that
the idea of you

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:84%
being just you has to
dissolve into there

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as just
a single I. Every I is

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:90%
the same I in each of us.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's complementarity.

00:32:38.975 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I love this,
because you have the quantum

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.353 align:middle line:84%
perspective, and I'm
going to bring it

00:32:43.353 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
to a life kind of example.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So say, for example, you're
in one financial bracket,

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and you know that there's a
possibility to make more money.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
You see people
making more money.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:90%
You see successful people.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
reality that you are not,

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and you can't pay your bills,
and you can't pay your rent.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.340 align:middle line:84%
You can go into
a quantum reality

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
where that exists, where you
are in that space of having

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
everything that you want and
being comfortable and being

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
taken care of and having that
financial abundance that you

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:90%
desire.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can constantly
overlap that

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and overlap, and really
share that reality.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
the judgment comes in?

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.693 align:middle line:90%
What does the judgment do?

00:33:26.693 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, let's
explain a little bit

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:90%
about what we call judgment.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is really a
voice which is telling us,

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:90%
you can't have that.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a negation of
the dream kind of thing.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that
quantum physics gives us

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:84%
not only the perspective
of, we can have something.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It also gives us the perspective
that we can't have something.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's not
only one thing or the other.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It's both and rather
than either or.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So you deal with it
as you would deal

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:84%
with any particular thought
process that you have.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
You simply say, OK.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I hear that I can't have it, but
I also hear that I can have it.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.699 align:middle line:90%
Both perspectives keep in mind.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And the old saying goes, you
feed the idea which feeds you,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.659 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't feed the
guy that's trying

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:84%
to defeat you, but feed the one
that's trying to support you.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:31.998 align:middle line:84%
So you go into the more positive
for yourself perspective.

00:34:31.998 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
visualization is.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's visualization.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:35.749 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:35.749 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
And you have a way of breaking
it down on how this all works.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We have another
slide here where you

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
have how we construct
the past, the quantum.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Right.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this
particular slide, we

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
have a particle of
light, a photon.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And it enters what is called
a half silvered mirror.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.980 align:middle line:90%
It's coming in, say, like that.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
according to quantum physics,

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it breaks up into
two possibilities.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say actualities.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't become two photons.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's only two photon
ghost possibilities

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that go on separate paths, and
then reflect off of mirrors

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and come back together again.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
half silvered mirror

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:90%
at the top of that diagram.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And if the two ghost
patterns are in phase

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
with each other, which
means they're vibratory

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, then
those two ghost waves

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:84%
will only reinforce
in one direction,

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get a picture of
the photon, a pop appearing

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:84%
in one of the collectors,
whereas if for some reason,

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
they're out of phase,
you can get one

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:90%
popping or the other popping.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.682 align:middle line:90%
You get either one popping.

00:35:56.682 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But if they're in phase, you
only get one of those popping.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:06.307 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Now if you for
some reason take the--

00:36:06.307 --> 00:36:08.640 align:middle line:84%
remember that you have a
mirror which splits them apart.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a mirror that's
on top which joins them.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If you take that mirror out
and then you have the particle,

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
the ghost particles, which
so far, as far as you know,

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
are still on two possible
paths, yet either collector,

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
either observer, either one
of those collecting plates

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
it will pop, but not both.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:90%
One or the other.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the question you
have in your mind

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:84%
is given that one of
those or the other popped,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way to
add things together,

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's no mirror
there to make that happen,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
then you'd have to
say, well, how did that

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
mirror to the right pop?

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The only way it
could have popped

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is that the photon must
have only gone on one path.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:90%
It didn't split apart.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So it reflected, and
then went on one path.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
if I put the mirror in,

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:90%
then it had to go on both paths.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.340 align:middle line:90%
So mirror in, it's both paths.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Mirror out, it's one
path or the other.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So now the question is,
the light enters the tube,

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and let's imagine the
tube is very long.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that light is coming
from Alpha Centauri, 4.3

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.590 align:middle line:90%
light years away, whatever.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And the two ghost paths are
around some star in between

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:90%
or something, whatever.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Galaxy in between so that now we
have two possible ghost paths.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's been traveling
4.3 light years, 4.3 years

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:90%
to get from where it left.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have a little
mirror, a little tiny mirror

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:90%
at the very end.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Put the mirror in, and it
has to go along both paths.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Take the mirror
out, it had to go

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:90%
along one path and the other.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So we at the moment have
decided what the past

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:90%
of that particle of light--

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you're
explaining the past.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you put this in
a real term example,

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:84%
like a real life example
of how that would work?

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, we
create the past.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Through our minds.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Through our minds.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Every day.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So we, by how
we choose to reflect--

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote,
"reflect--" about how

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
we got to where we got to
determines what possibilities

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.070 align:middle line:90%
were open to us, or not.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
If we choose that it
only was one way that we

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:90%
got to where we got to--

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:84%
(GRUFF VOICE) I got to where
I am by hard work and sweat,

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, and I don't
care about anything else!

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Then that's the only path
you had open to you, right?

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But if you begin to
realize that others were there

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to help you, and there were
other paths open to you,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and there were many, many paths
that got you to where you got

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
to, then you have what I
call a more compassionate--

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're right back
to that word again--

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:06.270 align:middle line:84%
a more compassionate view of
how you get to be where you are.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just you
that got you to be you.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of others
that got you to be you.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to see that,
you create a different path.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The path or the
past path, the path

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:90%
of the past that you create--

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
hard work, hard
work, hard work--

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%
puts you in a bind.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And that is your past.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what you see.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what you think
is your reality.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that tells
you that isn't true,

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you think they're crazy,
they're misguided, whatever.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, I got to
where I got to by my hard work.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.032 align:middle line:84%
But you can look at it--
you can come at it from two

00:39:50.032 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:90%
different perspectives.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And you create the past.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So along those
same lines, when we

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:84%
are creating an image
of the past, what

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:84%
happens when we're going into
the future and we have doubt,

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:90%
we have worry, we have fear?

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: OK.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at it from a point of
view of what we call a quantum

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%
field idea, OK?

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.680 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum
field theory, which

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the best theory we
have going right now to explain

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot of basic understanding
at the submicroscopic level,

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.150 align:middle line:84%
there are fields,
quantum fields.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we call
events or particles

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
are things that
pop in the field.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:90%
They're like excitations.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
They're like little bubbles of
froth on the ocean wave, OK?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And the picture we
have is that there

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:84%
are, between any two events
separated in space or time,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:84%
there are multiple
paths connecting those.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Many ways of getting there.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:04.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So that's basically
the quantum field.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of
our everyday life,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand that
both the past and the present

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or the present
and the future are

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:84%
from the point of
view of quantum fields

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.275 align:middle line:90%
already in existence.

00:41:25.275 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: They're already there.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
We're just finding out about it.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got to think of it as
time is like a river flowing.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's just flowing by,
flowing by, flowing by.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:42.885 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the river with
it, so we're flowing with it.

00:41:42.885 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we get out of the
river and stand on the shore,

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.880 align:middle line:84%
we can look ahead and see
where the river's going to be.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:90%
We can see where the river was.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.422 align:middle line:90%
We can see both the past and--

00:41:54.422 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field point of
view is being on the side,

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
past and the future

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of the river at the same time.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: OK?

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's the perspective.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens is that when
there is an idea, desire,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:84%
something that you want that
connects these two events,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is that not
only is there something which

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:84%
travels forward from your
point of view through time,

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
but there's also something
which comes back.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.798 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the thought,
I want to make this happen,

00:42:27.798 --> 00:42:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is good,
there's also the thought, well,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:90%
what if you don't do it right?

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So doubt is also a message
that you can receive,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.238 align:middle line:84%
because the movement
is both ways.

00:42:39.238 --> 00:42:40.280 align:middle line:90%
You can look to the past.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You can look to the--

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:90%
you can see both.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how we
create our reality.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So our realities
come into vision that way.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Now we can also do it
the other way around.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We may have the vision of
focusing, oh, we can't do that.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes back in
message, oh, yes, you can.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So doubt is always
going to be present.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Doubt is part of the parcel.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's part of a picture.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.630 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
whole bag of tricks

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:90%
that we have to deal with.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a question of,
let it be, because it's

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.520 align:middle line:90%
healthy to have doubt.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you go with the
doubt, you never do anything.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for fatalistic thinking
and people that really always

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
look at the worst
case scenario, they're

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.880 align:middle line:84%
going to create that,
because they never

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
have the opposite strain
or string that comes in.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: They stay always--

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:84%
they're in the
skeptical land view.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:90%
In the skeptical land view--

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
put their perspective--

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of
caught in the stream.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:43:44.905 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know
someone like this,

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and they constantly create
the worst case scenario.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: The worse case scenario.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So they're
always thinking

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:55.310 align:middle line:84%
about what bad things are
going to happen to them.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.232 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it always happens,
because when I say, why do you

00:43:58.232 --> 00:44:00.440 align:middle line:84%
always go to the worst case
scenario, they say, well,

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be aware.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.160 align:middle line:90%
You've got to understand.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know that these
things are going to happen.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.647 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
saying is, there's

00:44:05.647 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:84%
another reality
that can come in.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
It's good to be aware, but
enter in this reality of--

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: There's also the
opposite of the doubt.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So whatever you're
doubting, turn it upside down

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:84%
or around and see, what
is it that could happen

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:90%
that is not within the doubt?

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.487 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you're doubting.

00:44:25.487 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Byron Katie's
"The Work" I think of.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.880 align:middle line:90%
She has this turnaround.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.720 align:middle line:90%
So what if it wasn't that way?

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.520 align:middle line:90%
How would it be?

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
thing for visualization,

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.196 align:middle line:84%
to see things the way
you want them to be.

00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's seeing things
the way you want them to be.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's another very
important part of this.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.230 align:middle line:90%
We're in material form.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
pixelated dots, even

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:84%
though that's what we're
coming to in virtual reality.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.710 align:middle line:90%
But we have to get up and move.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:54.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Once we have the picture,
let's do something about it.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's not just sit there
and hope for the best.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Move along the path
which takes you there.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Walk your talk, so to speak.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.465 align:middle line:84%
Move along the path
which takes you there.

00:45:11.465 --> 00:45:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You can also move along
the path which you doubt.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I doubt it's going
to happen, so I'm

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
going to do everything I can to
make sure that doesn't happen.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.317 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
between how and who.

00:45:21.317 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it said,
well, how do we do this?

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.020 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Instead of moving into,
who can help us do this?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It takes the how
of the idea of the quantum,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and then it brings in
the action piece which

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
is, who can actually help
you do something or help you?

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is a
great conversation,

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.520 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
everything from quantum fields,

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.100 align:middle line:84%
parallel reality, string theory,
essentially, entanglement,

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: We haven't
got to strings yet.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, we haven't--

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.266 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about different--

00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Talking about
the quantum fields.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So now in the quantum field,
you can recreate your past,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.860 align:middle line:84%
essentially, by changing
your perspective

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.755 align:middle line:90%
on where the river has gone.

00:46:05.755 --> 00:46:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: In order to
do that, you have

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to come out of the
river, so to speak,

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:90%
and be able to look back.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's a question of how
you do that looking back.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:17.615 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: In other words,
the river's flowing.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you're
looking back, the past

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.233 align:middle line:84%
is constantly being
recreated all the time,

00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:90%
because the river's flowing.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It's flowing.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:90%
It's flowing.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.290 align:middle line:90%
What's back there?

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's back there?

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.780 align:middle line:90%
What's back there?

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.898 align:middle line:84%
Now how does string
theory relate to anything

00:46:32.898 --> 00:46:33.940 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about?

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I know that's not--

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:90%
--a slide.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, it is
the, I would say,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:47.920 align:middle line:84%
the last vestige of
the mechanical world

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.470 align:middle line:84%
view that we physicists
in particular

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.660 align:middle line:90%
are trying to develop.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The one thing about everything
we've talked about so far

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is we've left off the
most common thing we all

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:90%
experience called gravity.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you try to put gravity
and quantum physics together,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.600 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a mess.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't jive.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't work quite
together the right way.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:84%
People have been modeling
that with all kinds

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:84%
of interesting ideas, and
some of them are fascinating.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But the one that started
developing about 30,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:90%
40, 50 years ago--

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure exactly when--

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:31.152 align:middle line:84%
something called
string theory, which

00:47:31.152 --> 00:47:34.120 align:middle line:84%
said that there are
not point particles.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.380 align:middle line:90%
There are strings.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Each so-called particle
is made of strings.

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And these are not just-- they're
vibrating energy strings.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.090 align:middle line:90%
So they're energy vibrations.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.220 align:middle line:90%
So in a way, it's not particle.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It's energy vibrations.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But Einstein says
e equal mc squared,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
so energy and
matter are the same.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So if energy is there, there's
got to be matter there,

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.230 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's the basis
of string theory.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very complicated.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a great, great example.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've given you just
the real basic aspect of it.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are some interesting
things that come about.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, such that gravity
can be incorporated.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But it requires
extra dimensions.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.590 align:middle line:90%
I think 11, 12, 17.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many there are now.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm Yes.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Have they actually
been discovered?

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.955 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: No, because
they're too small.

00:48:33.955 --> 00:48:37.030 align:middle line:84%
These extra dimensions
are curled up.

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have spaghetti, and
you tightly wind the spaghetti

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.420 align:middle line:84%
around in very, very,
very, very tight curls,

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.535 align:middle line:84%
and they're so tight that
as far as you can see,

00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:84%
you can't see them
anymore, and it just

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.260 align:middle line:90%
looks like a straight line.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody wound
spaghetti up into a corkscrew,

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's so fine that it just--

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you can't see the ups and
downs of the corkscrew.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.650 align:middle line:84%
All you can see is
a straight line.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting,
because quantum physics

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.050 align:middle line:84%
explains so much of how
we live and what we do

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and how we create.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there are so
many great experiments

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.827 align:middle line:84%
that are done now that
explain the unexplainable.

00:49:15.827 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:10%
There are these
double blind, and they

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:10%
recreate these experiments
over and over and over again

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.645 align:middle line:10%
where you can
affect consciousness

00:49:22.645 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:10%
and different
localities, where you

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.420 align:middle line:10%
can have different tracks
going on at the same time.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.330 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
great experiments.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you involved in
anything right now?

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No, nothing like that.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.482 align:middle line:84%
Those are more, I think,
probably somebody else

00:49:37.482 --> 00:49:38.940 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
have on the show.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Dean Radin is a
fine scientist who's

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.560 align:middle line:84%
been investigating what is
formerly called, in the past,

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.762 align:middle line:90%
parapsychology.

00:49:48.762 --> 00:49:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what he
would call it today.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Might have a
different term for it.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are
your interests now?

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.678 align:middle line:90%
What are you moving into?

00:49:56.678 --> 00:49:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's a good question.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:58.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:49:58.770 --> 00:49:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.140 align:middle line:84%
What I'm interested in right
now is something called context

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.930 align:middle line:90%
duality.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The question is, is what we
observed, what we observe,

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.430 align:middle line:84%
affected by the background
in which it is observed?

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:21.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, is
there an objective--

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.130 align:middle line:84%
if I observe something
one way, is it always

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:24.750 align:middle line:90%
going to be that way?

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Or does my observation depend
upon what others have observed?

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So say we're
looking at this cup.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we want
to observe this cup.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
the field around it?

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The table, the
flowers, everything around it.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The question is, if I observe
the cup and I only see the cup,

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is what I see of the cup going
to change depending upon what

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:90%
environment that cup is in?

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And so the whole
idea of contextual--

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:02.370 align:middle line:84%
we used to think that in
so-called classical physics

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:90%
that things were non-contextual.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.010 align:middle line:84%
A ball is a ball is
a ball is a ball.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Red is red is red.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Non-contextual.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter what
other colors were there,

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.200 align:middle line:84%
but we all sort of learned
that even observation of color

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:90%
changes depending on background.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So obviously,
contextuality

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:27.580 align:middle line:84%
does affect what
we call reality.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So the context duality
of political thinking

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.620 align:middle line:90%
affects how we think today.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
are based upon what

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I call context duality.

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So my interest has been in,
how to explain context duality?

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:84%
The other things which
interests me is, how do we

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:90%
explain how do we explain?

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.702 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait, wait.

00:51:48.702 --> 00:51:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to go there for a sec.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But what you were
just talking about

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.215 align:middle line:84%
is along the lines
of epigenetics, yes?

00:51:53.215 --> 00:51:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: I don't know.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.440 align:middle line:90%
What is epigemetics?

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Epigenetics.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: What is it?

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what it is.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's where the
environment creates the--

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:84%
it affects the cells or
what's happening in the body.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.610 align:middle line:90%
So you can actually be--

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Well, that's part of it.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.260 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But we're more dealing
here with observation.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
is what I observe

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:21.330 align:middle line:90%
of something going to change--

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:24.210 align:middle line:84%
if I keep observing exactly
the same way all the time,

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:84%
but put it in a different
context, will it change?

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And the answer seems to be
under certain cin-- circun--

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stances.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --certain circumstances
it will actually change.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:36.200 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a context--

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.420 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics is indicated,
there is definitely

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.090 align:middle line:90%
a contextual aspect to it.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:84%
What this is leading
to is that the world

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:51.060 align:middle line:90%
is more mental than physical.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.100 align:middle line:84%
There's more of a
mental aspect to it.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.075 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.075 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
this is leading to.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the
direction I've gotten into.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And you asked me
what my interest was.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Along with that are questions
that come up in subjects

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:12.060 align:middle line:84%
we call ontology
and epistemology.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Ontology is, what's
really out there?

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Epistemology is, what do we
think is really out there?

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's two different
ways of thinking.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has taken
epistemology and ontology,

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.980 align:middle line:84%
which were quite well separated
in most people's minds,

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and jumbled them up
into kind of an omelet.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: One, physicist
Julian Jaynes,

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.500 align:middle line:90%
made that picture of that.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So we can no longer say that
what we think about and--

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.320 align:middle line:84%
what we think is really
there and what is really

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.100 align:middle line:84%
there are really things
that can be separated.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.350 align:middle line:90%
They're no longer separable.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what quantum physics
has brought into picture.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So this led me to thinking
about a lot of different things.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a school of thought
that a German mathematician

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.800 align:middle line:84%
who spent a lot of time
with Einstein at Princeton--

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Kurt Godel-- G-O-D-E-L, with an
umlaut over the O, Kurt Godel--

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:84%
he came up with the
principle of undecidability.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said that a system
even like arithmetic,

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.670 align:middle line:84%
which everybody understands,
it's possible to make

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:31.410 align:middle line:84%
statements about arithmetic
which cannot be proven under

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the laws of arithmetic.

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.130 align:middle line:90%
They're undecidable.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be
true, but we can't

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.240 align:middle line:90%
prove by the principles of--

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I mean, for
example, there's

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.260 align:middle line:90%
some things we can easily prove.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.280 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:90%
We can easily prove that.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:84%
That's within the
principles of arithmetic.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.395 align:middle line:84%
But there are other principles
which we cannot prove.

00:54:53.395 --> 00:54:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to get--

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As you get more into
mathematics and deeper into it.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Gets more into
logic of mathematics.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Logic, yes.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And so then it got me
thinking about, well, we're

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:03.540 align:middle line:90%
into quantum physics.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
quantum physics

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is itself capable of producing
statements about itself which

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:10.620 align:middle line:90%
are unprovable?

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So if that's
the case, then we're

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.710 align:middle line:90%
really into a mental world.

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The world cannot
be-- fundamentally,

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.790 align:middle line:90%
it cannot be physical.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It has to be mental.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean,
it's interesting.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.512 align:middle line:84%
You apply what you're
talking about to everything

00:55:23.512 --> 00:55:25.325 align:middle line:84%
from fake news to
propaganda to fear.

00:55:25.325 --> 00:55:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
look at that and you

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.410 align:middle line:84%
could say, what is
reality, and what is not?

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And how much are we being
involved with the context of it

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and impacted by the context
of it and what is real?

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is happening
in our society today.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We really need to more
than ever determine

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.990 align:middle line:84%
our own truth, which is why
this show is so important.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I think it's really important.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask you, what
is your biggest why?

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do what you do, Fred?

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:53.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, my biggest
why isn't anything about me.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's more about, why is there
something rather than nothing?

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Why is there anything at all?

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And why is there
an I-ness which is

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
capable of even asking
such a question as,

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.480 align:middle line:84%
why is there something
rather than nothing?

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Where does that all come from?

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
the big mystery.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the mystery
I've lived my life by.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's made me a very
curious person.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's one which continually
drives my introspection

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and my outerspection
into inquiring

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.290 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of what might
be called, quote, unquote,

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:90%
"reality."

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.530 align:middle line:90%
What is reality, anyway?

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:37.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about a lot
of specific topics here.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.000 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply what
we've learned today

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.100 align:middle line:84%
in quantum physics to this
chaotic, crazy world we

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:46.900 align:middle line:90%
live in?

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.740 align:middle line:90%
How do we really utilize it?

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The way we
utilize it is to realize

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that what you call an observer
is not a fixed thing, that you

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:06.400 align:middle line:84%
yourself are capable of changing
what you mean by I. Your

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I is not a fixed thing.

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The I-- this is what
quantum physics tells us.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the observer
that has to change.

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.215 align:middle line:84%
By changing the
observer, you create

00:57:16.215 --> 00:57:17.385 align:middle line:90%
and you change the reality.

00:57:17.385 --> 00:57:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
change your past,

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and you change your future,
and you change everything.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
significant other in your life,

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and that significant other
could be another person who

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:84%
is your same age, a younger
person, an older person,

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring your
I-ness to that person?

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:41.830 align:middle line:84%
How do you make that
observation of that person?

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.520 align:middle line:84%
How you do think when
you are with that person

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.560 align:middle line:90%
about that person?

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If you change how you
think about that person,

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:84%
if you change who is thinking
about this other person,

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.990 align:middle line:84%
if you just ask yourself
the question, who am I,

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.900 align:middle line:84%
or who is thinking
about this other person,

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:06.400 align:middle line:84%
just asking that question to
yourself will change the way

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.300 align:middle line:84%
you make the observation
of the other person.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And what'll
happen is the other person

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.390 align:middle line:84%
will begin to see
something different.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Just you-- you don't
have to even say a word.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You just in your
mind say to yourself,

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:24.900 align:middle line:84%
who's asking about this
other person opposite me?

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.770 align:middle line:90%
A great example of that.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: If you don't
answer the question--

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.800 align:middle line:90%
opposite.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.360 align:middle line:90%
You answer the question.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I am this other person's wife,
husband, father, mother, son,

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.550 align:middle line:90%
daughter, enemy, friend.

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Once you answer the
question in your mind,

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.980 align:middle line:84%
you automatically
put on interaction

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:53.680 align:middle line:84%
with that person in which that
person is going to psychically,

00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:00.730 align:middle line:84%
intuitively, in some way pick up
and will behave in relationship

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:03.410 align:middle line:90%
with your way of observing.

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And that is
what you need to do.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So what quantum physics tells
us, change the observer.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.010 align:middle line:90%
How do you change the observer?

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself the question,
who is observing?

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Just ask.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't answer.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: If you
answer, you get caught

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in a framework in which
you define the relationship

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:90%
in which you are in.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.682 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's important.

00:59:28.682 --> 00:59:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I am relating to my
daughter, I just say, I am--

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Don't even ask--

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.600 align:middle line:84%
just say, who is with
this other person?

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't even think of the
other person as daughter.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't label the other person.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Just-- there's
another being there.

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who am I?

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: What am I?

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Don't answer.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Just be with the person
without labeling yourself.

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The other person might
get uncomfortable

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and start labeling.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, Mom, what are you doing?

00:59:57.730 --> 00:59:59.170 align:middle line:90%
What are you talk--

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's presence.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Be present.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Let her do it.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.760 align:middle line:90%
But just stay with--

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we use that
with the news,

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.650 align:middle line:90%
when we're watching the news?

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, watch the news
and watch it, but don't get

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.020 align:middle line:90%
caught up with it.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the river flowing past you.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Think of it as flowing past you.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't get caught with the river.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of us get caught
with the river.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, those dirty guys.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.120 align:middle line:90%
They did that.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.412 align:middle line:90%
Why does the president do that?

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Why does-- da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't get caught in the river.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Let the river flow.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.010 align:middle line:90%
News comes in, it goes out.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:34.023 align:middle line:90%
It's like watching a TV drama.

01:00:34.023 --> 01:00:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is a drama.

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
So you just become the observer.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Observe without labeling
what or who you think you are.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't fixate on a
particular point of view.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Let it flow.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Open the gates.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.632 align:middle line:84%
Don't label yourself as being
a Democrat, a Republican.

01:00:57.632 --> 01:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know, it's
so counterintuitive.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking of all
the marketing out there.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to
put you in a hole--

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Grab your eyeballs.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
marketers are trying to do.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.607 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to label you.

01:01:09.607 --> 01:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they're doing.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this person likes--

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Identify.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.553 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: What are you
going to identify with.

01:01:15.553 --> 01:01:18.444 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get out
of that identity--

01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:19.365 align:middle line:90%

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%

If we could live our

it would be such
a peaceful planet.

the ways in which
the observer goes

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.380 align:middle line:10%
about making the observation.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Just witness it all without
attaching ourself to it.
