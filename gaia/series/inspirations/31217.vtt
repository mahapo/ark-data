>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.469 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our Los
Angeles studio.

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:84%
You've heard about the
movie, "The Secret,"

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and how it talks all about
the law of attraction.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about the
law of no matter what?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Lisa Nichols is one of
the visionary teachers

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
of "The Secret," and she is
here to keep it absolutely

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
authentic and real,
and talk about what

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to do when life throws
you curve balls,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and how to overcome
those obstacles.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Lisa is known as the
breakthrough specialist,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and she has an enormous
amount of breakthroughs

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that she has had in her life
and a lot of breakdowns, too.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You have?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.584 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Lisa.

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:57.249 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA NICHOLS: Thank
you so much, Lisa.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to be here with
you and to be in your space

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is my honor
because I love you.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
I think you are fabulous.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.857 align:middle line:84%
And you came from
not far around here.

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:90%
You grew up in this area, right?

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: No, this is
my old neighborhood.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of fun, did a lot
of damage over in this area.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad to be here with you.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always hear you talk
about your story and where I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.596 align:middle line:84%
see you now is this
magnificent speaker and--

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Thank you.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: --such an
inspiration to so many people,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.724 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't
always like for you.

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Not at all.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that my life
represents-- and I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
hear from all over
the world whenever

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I travel internationally,
people always

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:90%
say you remind me of myself.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm the people's
person, the people's inspirator

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
because I represent
getting back up.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
My life is a result
of being committed

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:90%
to get back up one more time.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Not counting the
number times I've

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
been knocked down,
not singing that song,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
being committed to get
back up one more time.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's interesting.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're not so
focused on the times

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.956 align:middle line:90%
where you were knocked down.

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You're focused on
the times you got up.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yeah.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
If you notice the stories
that we use to bond

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
normally are the stories
of being knocked down.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.796 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you think that was bad?

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.296 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
what happened to me.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:15.055 align:middle line:84%
But what if we were bold
enough to celebrate,

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I got up from that?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the stripes
of challenges and woes,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
what if there were
badges of get up?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.614 align:middle line:84%
I got up from being born and
raised in South Central Los

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Angeles and living
between the hollering

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:90%
'30s and the rolling '60s.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.475 align:middle line:84%
I got up from being a C
student and struggling all

00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:90%
through school.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I got up from being
touched inappropriately.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I got up from those things.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Not that woe, is me.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I got up from those things.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So who am I designed to be?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you told me earlier
that you got a D in Speech.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I got a
D minus in Speech.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How is that possible?

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.423 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Well, not only did
I get a D minus in Speech.

00:02:50.423 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:84%
My Speech teacher said
quote unquote Ms. Nichols,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you never
speak in public,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:90%
that you get a desk job.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And guess what I did.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I went and got a desk job.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I was in accounting for seven
years, Lisa, accounting.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Were you really?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.714 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Oh my God.

00:03:06.714 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I was such a danger
to the field.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I was a danger to the field.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.782 align:middle line:84%
And I learned there that if
you don't balance by a nickel,

00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you have to stay
until you balance.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I just pulled a nickel
out from my pocket,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
put it in the drawer,
and went home.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.022 align:middle line:84%
Someone got in trouble
after four years

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of me being in that industry,
and then I went on three more

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.087 align:middle line:84%
before-- the last job I had,
they brought me in the office.

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And they started reviewing me,
and I got nervous at one point.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I said are you firing me?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said you're
a really nice lady.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Everyone here loves you.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
fire you, but we

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
do need to release you
to find your dream.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I said does that mean I show
up here tomorrow to find it?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to look for it here?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But get this--
fast-forward 20 years,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.212 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing on stage
in front of 3,000 women.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And a woman's on the
front row, and she's

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.957 align:middle line:90%
crying the entire time.

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:58.165 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the speech,
I finally go up to her,

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and I got you've been crying
for an hour and a half.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Why are you crying?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.075 align:middle line:84%
She goes because 20
years ago, I released

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
you to find your dream,
and you found it.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
The same woman that
fired me from accounting.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
She goes congratulations.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Just keep getting back up.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You have done that
so many times.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
you speak, I mean,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
you would think that you'd
done it all your life.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The way you touch,
and move, and inspire,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and the responsiveness
you get from your audience

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.819 align:middle line:90%
is so pure and so beautiful.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get
through one interview

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
without crying with you.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.254 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Good luck.

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.062 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Because you are so real.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So you grew up here
in Los Angeles.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
You were a single mom
and raised your child.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.664 align:middle line:84%
And you made a commitment at
a certain point in your life

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that you were going
to turn this around.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
What was that moment for
you, or series of moments?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yeah.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
My son and I lived in Inglewood,
California by the airport.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he was born, I had to
get on government's assistance

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:90%
just to have him.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have money
to have my baby.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have money
to feed my baby.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was a rock bottom, but
it felt like I sunk even lower

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
when he was eight months
old, and I didn't have money

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:90%
to buy him Pampers.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had to wrap
my son, Jaylani,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:90%
in a towel for two days.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my son lying
on the couch on his back.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Touching his stomach, I
said don't worry, Jaylani.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Mommy will never be
this broke again.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I felt the
wall of what bottom felt like.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And I thought OK.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Now I know what it feels like.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:90%
So now let's get up.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And I began to-- now,
here's the key thing--

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I began to be comfortable
being uncomfortable

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:90%
in a new possibility.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say it like this.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Most people will stay in a
familiar, keyword, familiar

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
discomfort, Lisa, before
they're willing to move

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
to an unfamiliar possibility.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we'll stay in
a place of discomfort--

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Because
it's familiar,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's
familiar, versus going

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
don't know is out there,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:90%
but I'm willing to go for it.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I went and I learned from
people who didn't look like me.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I learned from older

I was willing, Lisa,
to leap while I

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
At 15, I walked away from church
because organized religion

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:90%
didn't work for me.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It was confined.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It was judgmental.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:90%
It was hurtful.

But I knew that there
was a God in me.

There was a universal
God that I knew

I was 21 years old.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%

And so I was just interested.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I heard God
saying I want to use you.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Like I could hear your voice.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard
God as a child,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
but I heard God say
I want to use you.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.512 align:middle line:84%
I need you-- I
kid you not, Lisa.

This is exactly what he said.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I need you to go
heal my children.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So I began to work
with kids, teenagers.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like your intuition.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It's that whisper.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I heard it, I
was a little offended,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:90%
like I've got to work with kids?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.626 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to work
with kids because I

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
thought I'm going
get kids like me.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I was a bucker.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Like you tell me
to go right, I want

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to go left just because
you said go right.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was afraid I'd
find me out there,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:90%
and I'd have to work with her.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Of course I found me.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:90%
I found thousands of me.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.571 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed
to work with them.

00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%

>>NICHOLS: Absolutely not.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
I was only supposed

to work with African American
kids in South Central.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And then God said, again,
I said my children.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.875 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say color.

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say religion.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:90%
And so then I start traveling.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it just became
bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Tell the truth.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.358 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's raising their hands.

00:11:53.358 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm the example.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm the first example how the
world's suppose to love me,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.895 align:middle line:84%
and I have to give them
the best example ever.

Beautiful, Lisa.

>>NICHOLS: You know how
you've looked at someone

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and said I just wish
I had the whatever--

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and you fill in the blank--
that she had or he had,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:90%
then it'd all be good?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if God
gave you everything

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
you need, everything
that you'll need?

>>LARRY KING: The new
issue of "People" magazine

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
has an article entitled "The
Secret, Salvation or Hype?"

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: "The
Secret" breathes hope.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I do know is
that in Proverbs it

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
talks about so a
man thinketh, he is.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
In Matthew it says
if you ask and you

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
believe in your prayers,
then you will receive it.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.149 align:middle line:84%
So it is one absolutely
from the base

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:90%
of what God has planned for us.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
That we have the right
to live an abundant life.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.925 align:middle line:90%
That's non-negotiable.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Now if we choose to have
that life, that's on us.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
were at a restaurant,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and you ordered
something, you fully

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.466 align:middle line:84%
expect it to come
served that way.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OPRAH WINFREY: Yes.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.923 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: That's
how the universe is.

00:13:00.923 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You're putting out orders
consciously and unconsciously

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.525 align:middle line:90%
and expect it to come back.

00:13:04.525 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying I'll never
have a great relationship,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:90%
you just placed an order.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when we choose
to live a life of abundance,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and joy, peace,
happiness, then that

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
feels much better
than if we choose

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:90%
to live a life in scarcity.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
And you'll have doubters.

strong Christian faith,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.877 align:middle line:90%
does that conflict with this?

>>NICHOLS: No.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.484 align:middle line:84%
For me, it doesn't because
I searched this to make sure

00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that God was all through it.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.941 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my commitment to God
is stronger than anything.

>>NICHOLS: Yeah,
absolutely, but I also

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
see the mama who's holding

>>NICHOLS: You know,
there's this wow.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And then to have not gotten any
particular external validation

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that you should be doing this
in terms of a degree in it,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
or the path I took--

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's a trap.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

to show it to the world.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.155 align:middle line:90%

00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Circle of

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Circle of chaos.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Your circle of chaos
because you are repeating.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:90%
You're repeating your pattern.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Your life is a physical
manifestation of the habits

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:90%
that you've had for years.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Your relationships, the
quality of communication,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
it's simply a 2013, 2015,
2020 experience of 2010.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're showing up
into a new environment,

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and you're bringing old habits.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like writing the
story of your life, Lisa.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And your chapter 24
is blank, but you

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
cut and paste your chapter
4 into your chapter 24,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you ask the
question-- think about this--

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.142 align:middle line:90%
how did I end up here?

00:16:14.142 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why isn't
it any different?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I wanted it.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.044 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: How did
I end up here again?

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
No, this was a new place.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.906 align:middle line:84%
You just brought
old habits to it.

00:16:20.906 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Right,
it's kind of sobering.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.961 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: It's sobering.

00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It's very sobering.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.745 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The question I've been
asking myself a lot lately

00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
is how do you break
through to that next level

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
without having any reference
point and a ton of old habits?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yes.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So number one is the
part that most people

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do because
I think it's called zero.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to stand in 100%
accountability and ownership

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
for your break down.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to fast-forward
to the breakthrough.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Listen, you can't Google
download your breakthrough.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Google is the Internet.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It was invented 20 years ago.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
We've been living
for a long time.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't Google download
your breakthrough.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.929 align:middle line:84%
So first you have to
understand what's in breakdown.

00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to do that.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
People come to me from all
over the world, my students.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And they go give
me a breakthrough.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You're the breakthrough
specialist.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I say OK, let's find
out what's in breakdown?

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They're like no, I don't
want to talk about that.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Can you hurry up
and get me to a breakthrough.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:90%
I've only got three days.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I'm like hold on.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to
get to manifesting.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.061 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Right, exactly.

00:17:15.061 --> 00:17:15.364 align:middle line:90%
I want a manifest.

00:17:15.364 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I want a vision.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.721 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to deal
with that stuff.

00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get
to a breakthrough,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to be willing to really
unpack your breakdown so you

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
can go to the source of it.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Now in order to
unpack it correctly,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
you need to unpack it
in different categories.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.109 align:middle line:84%
I call it the nine
environments of you.

00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You need to unpack it in
different categories, not just

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:90%
my life.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.045 align:middle line:90%
Unpack your spirituality.

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
What's in breakdown there?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Unpack your finances.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:90%
What's in breakdown there?

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Unpack your relationship.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Love, family, friends,
each separately.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That can
be overwhelming.

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Just the three.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's six more to go.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.564 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yeah.

00:17:50.564 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:90%
There's six more to go.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.679 align:middle line:84%
And then to be OK,
don't get stuck--

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you not get--

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.716 align:middle line:90%
--in the reality of now.

00:17:55.716 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So number one, make
it black and white.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.506 align:middle line:90%
Don't just get in your head.

00:17:58.506 --> 00:18:00.849 align:middle line:84%
Get it out of your head
because emotions are there.

00:18:00.849 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You mix between your head
and your heart so much.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So put it on paper, rate it from
a one to a five, one to a five.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Five is it's absolutely,
exactly like I want it,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and one being it's in breakdown.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in complete breakdown.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And so you rate it.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
If it's a two, I
need to work on it.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
If it's a one, I
need to work on it.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
If it's a three, I
need to work on it.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's it.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
You just get it out.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Just rate it.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Just get it out and rate it.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And then just go focus on
your threes, twos, and ones.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is in a
one, go there first.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to do all of them.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:90%
You have a lifetime.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:90%
You have a lifetime.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I laser on one area every
45 days to a quarter.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
If it's kind of big, and then
I give myself 90 days for it.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.314 align:middle line:84%
But one, penetrate deep and
narrow, deep and narrow.

00:18:38.314 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And taking it
on all at once doesn't--

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: It's what you
said, it's overwhelming.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --which is what I do.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: But that's
what super achievers do.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to clean it
all up right now.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.555 align:middle line:90%
Clean it up one room at a time.

00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Clean up one corner at a time.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you in that over
achievers' anonymous category

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:90%

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.143 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you broken
that habit in your life?

00:18:56.143 --> 00:18:56.726 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: No.

00:18:56.726 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:90%
No, I haven't.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.354 align:middle line:90%
I manage it.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I manage it.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I tell people I am
so far from perfect.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.335 align:middle line:84%
Only thing I do differently
is I manage my imperfection

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:07.626 align:middle line:90%
a lot better than other people.

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:08.167 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whew.

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Good, good.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I'm so
far from perfect,

00:19:10.268 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
but I just know how to
manage my imperfection.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.245 align:middle line:90%
I've been with me.

00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You've been with
you a long time.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: You know your stuff.

00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I tell people we're sneaky
because we're brilliant.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
My excuses have Swarovski
crystals on them, honey.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my junk looks good,
so I have to watch out.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I have to hold myself
accountable at a higher level.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I know where
I have breakdown.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I know that I love to say yes.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.158 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I love to say yes.

00:19:34.158 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I ask the people around me
who are in my support circle,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:90%
help me to say no.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So I need you to
ask me this way.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So I actually enrolled the
support of my community.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I need you to ask
me Lisa, can you make it here?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
If you come, are you
not doing something else

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:90%
you should be doing?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.807 align:middle line:90%
That answer normally is yes.

00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I ask for help.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
See, super achievers have a
tendency to not ask for help.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that the
cape on your back is not real,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
honey, and the S on
your chest is Crayola,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that
every night when

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
you get in the shower,
your S washes off,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and that superhero
conversation is not true.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
That supershero
conversation is not true.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
You're an ordinary
woman choosing every day

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to make extraordinary decisions.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, and my mind
becomes my kryptonite

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
where I start to negative
self-talk everything I

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.344 align:middle line:90%
didn't do.

00:20:22.344 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: And
then every time you

bit of energy from yourself.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of your
life seeps out of you.

See, here's what I learned.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I learned that
the world is going

to follow my example
of how I treat me.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The same thing that you
heard me say with Oprah.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't just say it
because it was a sexy cliche.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was
teaching the world

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.367 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't need rest.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.825 align:middle line:84%

I realize I'm human.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.162 align:middle line:84%
Just surrender
inside the realness.

00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a level of
realness with yourself.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be
comfortable seeing

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:90%
that much of realness from you.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
See, you're not
protecting the ordinary,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.852 align:middle line:90%
the woman from the world, Lisa.

00:22:36.852 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You're protecting the
woman from yourself

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
quite know-- well,

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
if I stop and I slow down,
what's going to happen?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, because when
I'm in that burned out place,

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.154 align:middle line:84%
I am worthless to
everyone including myself.

00:22:48.154 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: And we
drive ourselves there.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.235 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You don't
just land at burnout.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't Google
download burnout.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
You get in your
automobile called

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
your life, called your schedule,
called your too many yeses,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.979 align:middle line:84%
and then you drive
over to burnout.

00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You say yes to burnout.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I say yes to burnout all day.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I learn
it all the time.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just speaking
to you as a teacher.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I'm speaking to
you as a constant student.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.843 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am a constant student.

00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: And I'm
a constant student.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I wind up
saying that phrase over and over

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and over again to my daughter.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.058 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I apologize.

00:23:15.058 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I apologize.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.622 align:middle line:84%
I taught you you didn't need to
pack your stuff before school.

00:23:18.622 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Right.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I apologize.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.188 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Right.

00:23:21.188 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
You need to pack your stuff.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.313 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That worked.

00:23:23.313 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
That one worked good.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to take a look
at how Lisa Nichols motivates,

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.517 align:middle line:84%
inspires, and really contributes
to so many people's success.

00:23:32.517 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.035 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.035 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You know,
there's one thing that I

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
love that can never be
outgrown, that you can never

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
get too much of, and
that's inspiration.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the
economy is, no matter what

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
your job is doing, where
your relationship is going,

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:90%
you can always use inspiration.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:90%
To inspire is powerful.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember living in
South Central Los Angeles

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and working for LA
Unified School District.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
While I love LA, and I love
LA Unified School District,

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%
I needed inspiration.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I needed inspiration to
make a global change.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
something in me that

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
was bigger than the experience
that I was living, that

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
was bigger than the assignment
that I was living out

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And the distance-- the distance
between where I was living

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and where I could be
was simply the level

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in which I was inspired.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Motivating the
Masses is committed

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to inspiring you
to your greatness,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to being that fire in
your belly that takes it

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
from a flicker to
a flame, from being

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that space, that community
that reminds of not only

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
who you've been, and
that he or she is OK,

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
but who you are becoming, and
that he or she is necessary.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I love the way the
community that I

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
get to sit in inspires us,
inspires you, and inspires me.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Through our programs,
our commitment

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is to teach you, to inform
you, to educate you,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:90%
to give you guidance.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But underneath it all,
it's to inspire you,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to inspire you to do the things
you've never done before so

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that you can have the results
that you've never had before so

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
that you ultimately can live the
life that you've only dreamed

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:90%
of living.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Motivating the masses.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:90%
That is what you do.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It's what you have done for me.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You have motivated me in so
many different breakdowns

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.086 align:middle line:84%
in my life, and always
been there for me, and--

00:25:27.086 --> 00:25:27.961 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Thank you.

00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:29.167 align:middle line:90%
And always will be.

00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:30.101 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aw, really?

00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:31.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Always--
really, really.

00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wrote
down some things.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You said you if you want
to get something different,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
something different.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yes.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So meaning that we
can't create a different result

00:25:40.657 --> 00:25:42.073 align:middle line:84%
by doing the same
thing that we've

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:43.504 align:middle line:84%
done over and over
and over again.

00:25:43.504 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Not at all.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the thing
that you have to do new you

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.912 align:middle line:90%
don't even know about yet.

00:25:48.912 --> 00:25:50.745 align:middle line:84%
See, you're trying to
think of something new

00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:53.172 align:middle line:84%
to do in the same
capacity of what you know.

00:25:53.172 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You may have to go out and
get some new information.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You may have to redefine who
you choose to be in the world.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You may have to say
listen, I want my future.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:90%
This is me.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I want my future to
look barely recognizable

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
in such an amazing way.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, I've got to
go gather something different.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
You are a culmination of
all your past choices.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
things you love.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, keep doing that.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But anything that's out
of sync for you, then we

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
have to do something
different in that area.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, you've
taken yourself, Lisa,

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:90%
as far as you can take yourself.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:90%
That's when you reach out.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.658 align:middle line:84%
The best thing in my life
was I went and got a coach.

00:26:29.658 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was
smart in some areas,

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
but I had taken myself as
far as I could take myself.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:90%
And boy, she stretched me.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do for you
every time we're together.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I stretch you.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I cause
you to go further

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:84%
than you may go
without me being here.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're courageous enough
to take that journey with me.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
courageous enough--

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, to take
the coaching, too.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yes.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.306 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, I
think about your life,

00:26:51.306 --> 00:26:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and where you explain
that you came from.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And where you are now could
have not even been in your DNA

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.444 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:26:58.444 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Not at all.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I look up.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why I tear up when I
even look at my own promo video

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.526 align:middle line:90%
and go who would have thunk?

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:08.025 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:08.025 --> 00:27:08.608 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:11.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: But I went, and
you have to be willing.

00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
That's when I said
you've got to be

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
willing to go into an
unfamiliar possibility, Lisa.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.747 align:middle line:90%
And just that phrase alone--

00:27:17.747 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's very uncomfortable.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Very uncomfortable.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
willing to say teach me

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.895 align:middle line:84%
how to be the woman that
I wasn't, but that I

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
could become.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
See, even in this
level of success,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:90%
you can't beat the 2012 woman.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.549 align:middle line:90%
She's so over?

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gone, yeah.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You want
to know, what's

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
my 2020 version of me look like?

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Show me how to be her.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do
I find that out?

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Where do I get that
frame of reference?

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Well,
programs like this.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You know,
there's a consciousness.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:90%
There's an awareness.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Before you'll ever move
your physical life,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.422 align:middle line:84%
your mental zip code
has to take a trip.

00:27:58.422 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%

>>NICHOLS: That's learning.

00:28:08.614 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, find coaches.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Go inside books, but here's
what I see so many people do.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't just think about
it and life will change.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't just talk about
it and life will change.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to get the
information and find out

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:90%
what's the applied learning.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm a results-based coach.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%
So you know me.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:90%
You've been in my rooms.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I push to results.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:90%
What's the action step?

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:90%
What's the action step?

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Action is the
antidote for despair.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And action is the
prescription for success.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.762 align:middle line:90%
So I don't care what you know.

00:28:40.762 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:90%

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
what are you doing?

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
To get something different,
I'm going to ask you

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.004 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So day-to-day activity

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So let me give you an example.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.202 align:middle line:84%
Let's take it from

00:29:00.202 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, yeah.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.368 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You say
my relationships

00:29:02.368 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.146 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm going
to coach you to go

00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:90%
to the people in your life.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Find three people,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You look at this,

10, 10 being amazing

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and everything you want
it to be, one being it's

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
completely dysfunctional,
not working for you.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
How will you rate this
relationship with me?

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, that's
a bold question.

00:29:24.915 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Scary, huh?

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.152 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:27.152 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You've
got to get some--

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In order to
ask that question,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to be willing
to want to make changes.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.611 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Exactly.

00:29:31.611 --> 00:29:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about well,
I really want change.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me give you some
techniques to get some changes.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
If the relationship-- husband or
wife, mother or father, sister,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:84%
brother, anyone-- go to
them today right when

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:90%
this show ends.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave until the show ends.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And then ask them how would
you relate our relationship

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
on a scale from 1 to
10, 10 being amazing,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
one being completely
dysfunctional, not working.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.265 align:middle line:84%
The second question is the
one that really matters.

00:29:55.265 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.974 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: When they
say, hm, it's a seven.

00:29:57.974 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, I asked my
son Jaylani when he was eight.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The first time I asked
him this question--

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I ask him this same
question every six months.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.227 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:30:05.227 --> 00:30:06.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: He's now 18.

00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him every six months
since he was eight years old.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It drives him crazy
now, by the way.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I go, Jaylani, on a scale from
1 to-- He goes Mom, really?

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.672 align:middle line:90%
I go really.

00:30:14.672 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
He goes why do you
keep doing this?

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I say because it's my job to
keep checking in with this

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.791 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
I'm doing the work.

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So the second question is,
after they've rated it,

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
first time Jaylani--
I asked him.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:90%
He said a seven, seven.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It was sobering, like
a ton of bricks hit me.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But you can't be emotional,
and you can't respond emotional

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:84%
because then they're afraid
to tell you the truth again.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Then they're
afraid to tell you

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want to hurt you.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: So when
he said a seven,

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the second question
is the key question.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:84%
What will take it
from a 7 to a 10?

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.327 align:middle line:84%
What will take it
from a 7 to a 10?

00:30:42.327 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I learned that from my
friend Jack Canfield.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
it ever since.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked my son Jaylani
what will take it from a 7

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to a 10, he goes when you go
out of the country, Mommy,

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I want to go with you.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.604 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: The next
month, I took him

00:30:54.604 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:90%
out of the school he was in.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I enrolled him in
a private school.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And the contingency of me
taking him to that school

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.382 align:middle line:84%
was that when I
travel internationally

00:31:03.382 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that he can distance
learn with me.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%

with me to Africa.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.355 align:middle line:84%

>>NICHOLS: And then
three years later, I

00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:90%
asked him the question again.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was like oh, it's
a nine, nine and a half.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.815 align:middle line:84%
And I said well, what will
take it from a nine and a half

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:90%
to a ten?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.811 align:middle line:90%
He goes Mom--

00:31:20.811 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's good.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I don't even know.

00:31:22.768 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just weird to say
it's a 10 with my Mom.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm like OK, it
goes to 9 and 1/2.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.555 align:middle line:84%
And then he said I don't need
to travel with you anymore.

00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So the movement in your
life happens in the action.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's also where the
butterflies or the birds

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:90%
arise in your belly.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But that's also where
you get to push past

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
where you've stopped before.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about agitation
when it happens at that moment

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
whereas maybe you hear something
you just don't want to change,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.540 align:middle line:84%
or want to hear, or
when you get frustrated,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.409 align:middle line:84%
when you hit that wall,
when you hit that breakdown?

00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about it earlier,
about going to that no matter

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.126 align:middle line:90%

you will have breakdowns.

>>NICHOLS: No.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Breakdown means
that I'm stretching,

my seams are screaming.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I call it my seams
are screaming.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You know like the seams
on the side of your jeans

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
when your jeans really
should not be on you anymore?

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
My seams are screaming because
I'm at the edge of what I know.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the edge
of what I've done.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.585 align:middle line:90%
I've outgrown this season.

>>NICHOLS: If you look

one inside the rating,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
it could be that
you've completed

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
the season of it
looking like that.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: See, when
I was motivating LA,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.554 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just in LA,
and all of a sudden,

00:33:28.554 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:90%
I start feeling comfortable.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.385 align:middle line:84%
Like I feel limited, and I
feel-- I was in breakdown.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was in
breakdown because it

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:90%
was time to motivate California.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: And then
around California, I

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:90%
started having issues.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.675 align:middle line:84%
Then it was time to
do international.

00:33:40.675 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you started
off motivating teens.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yes.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, not only
motivating, but listening to

00:33:46.363 --> 00:33:47.339 align:middle line:90%

00:33:47.339 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Transformational
work for teens.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: Yes.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
very clear distinction

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that you have between

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Very
clear distinction

00:33:54.515 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:84%
between motivation,

00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Very clear distinction
between them.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the difference
real quick because I--

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Information is
the delivery of content.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.249 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to be inspired,
it's the traffic school guy.

00:34:07.249 --> 00:34:08.622 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if you like me.

00:34:08.622 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Get your pass after eight hours
of being in traffic school.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:12.696 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: It's information.

00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:14.501 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a lot
of our teachers--

00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
we have some great teachers
who inspire and motivate--

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.291 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of teachers who are
just there for the information.

00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So you don't really
remember them.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.523 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:21.523 --> 00:34:23.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: So
that's information.

00:34:23.602 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the first level.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The next is motivation, very
topical, excited, rah rah,

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:90%
go go, run run!

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, break the bricks.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Walk through
the fire, yeah.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Which is great
because that can jumpstart you.

00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And you need that to jumpstart
you, to get you kind of going.

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:90%
But it's topical--

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wakes you up.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: --it's topical, and
you need more in about 90 days.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And then inspiration is that
soul-stirring in your soul.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:90%
You get it kind of quiet.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a loud thing.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a mmm.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
mmms with inspiration.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you want to be a
better woman, be a better man.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.002 align:middle line:84%
And then there's transformation,
the road less traveled.

00:35:00.002 --> 00:35:01.460 align:middle line:84%
That's when someone's
willing to go

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:90%
with you to your darkest place--

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: --and
walk out beside you

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:07.012 align:middle line:90%
so you see a new possibility.

00:35:07.012 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Every time I speak, I'm
talking about transformation,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:84%
which is why I say look
at these nine environments

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:90%
in your life and rate them.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.587 align:middle line:90%
That's not fun.

00:35:14.587 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Go to the
relationship and ask them

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
how would you rate
this relationship?

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.581 align:middle line:90%
That's not fun.

00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: But on the other
side is a transformation.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
is something new

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and potentially unrecognizable.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does this
work with teenagers,

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:84%
as well, who could be
talked to and at forever?

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Lisa, I'm afraid
that those who are watching

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:90%
won't even believe me.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:84%
They won't believe
what I've seen.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.850 align:middle line:84%
My company has worked with
over 210,000 teens worldwide.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: 210,000 in
Montreal, and Quebec, and over

in Australia, and Switzerland
now, and Taipei, and in Africa.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you
all over the world

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and all 15-year-olds,
16-year-olds, 12-year-olds,

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and 18-year-olds looking from
Africa, looking from Taipei,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:90%
and looking from Australia.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They all are ready
for transformation.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.481 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:36:14.481 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:90%

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: They just want
it served on a platter

00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:90%

>>NICHOLS: Oooh, are
you ready for it?

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.286 align:middle line:90%
We don't listen.

00:36:29.286 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Adults?

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: We don't listen.

00:36:31.035 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't listen to them.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:90%
We say what were you thinking?

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And then before they
can discover it,

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:90%
we give them their thoughts.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You
know, we've done it.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't let them speak
because the silence is

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.510 align:middle line:90%
too awkward for us.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:90%
We don't let them speak.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.676 align:middle line:84%
And then if they don't say
what we want them to say,

00:36:48.676 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:90%
then we go in on them.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:90%
So they're not safe.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel
emotionally safe.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to hear it,
but it's the truth,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:84%
which is why I will do this
work until the last breath

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
in my body leaves my soul.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what we do, we spend
an hour in our training,

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:84%
an hour creating a safe
space so they really

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:90%
get it's a save space.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And then once we do
that, flood gates.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:90%
But not just what's bad.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Flood gates are who they want
to be, the stuff they've done.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Parents are blown away when
they come to graduation,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:90%
and I say OK, talk to her now.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And a 17-year-old teenage
boy would say Mom,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
so I'm sorry I broke the
integrity contract with you

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
when I told you

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I apologize for
the way I treated you.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I know it must
have made you feel

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
unappreciated and unvalued.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480 align:middle line:90%

>>NICHOLS: Here's what
I learned this weekend.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I learned that words don't
land on your on your ears, Mom.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:40.942 align:middle line:90%
They land on your heart.

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I'm committed
to do differently, Mom.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm committed to press pause
on my negative self-talk

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and play on my powerful
self-talk before I speak.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Parents are like this and
just sobbing, sobbing.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: We have to
stand behind the parents

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:90%
because they never thought that.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They brought their kids
there for us to fix them.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
we say to their teens

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is we're not going to fix you
because you are not broken.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.088 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to learn
how to listen to you,

00:38:05.088 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to guide
you, and facilitate you

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.210 align:middle line:90%
through the rough terrain.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.685 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
beautiful-- and I don't

00:38:11.685 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
say it's the most
beautiful terrain I've ever

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:90%
seen because I created it.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I stand in it.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in awe.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm in awe of every
single time, Lisa.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.309 align:middle line:84%
210,000 teens, we have a
predictable transformation.

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Every single time--

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every single time?

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: --every single time
they get to the same result

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.479 align:middle line:84%
no matter where we
are in the world.

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What blows my mind is
that your son Jaylani is now--

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: A facilitator.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.830 align:middle line:90%
He'll be 19 this year.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:90%
He now facilitates.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
He facilitated
our last workshop,

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and I just stopped talking.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we normally
co-facilitate.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I do about 70%.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:45.400 align:middle line:90%
He does about 30.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought let me just stop
talking and see what happens.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped talking,
and he talked more.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I stopped a little
more, he'd talk more.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.871 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: And then the room
got engaged in a different view.

00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm a good facilitator,
but I'm a 47-year-old woman.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: He's a
18-year-old kid.

00:39:04.016 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, he's--

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: So it's a
now conversation now.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Man, so we're teaching
coming up soon.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.849 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
do the same thing.

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to quiet.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.015 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:39:14.015 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I'm going
to introduce him.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.067 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to relay with him
so he doesn't get stuck.

00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's the best
thing on the planet.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And he's not perfect.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And he shares his junk.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I braced
myself as a mother.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows
it's a safe space.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And he knows there are not
going to be any repercussions.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have
to be the example.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: You have
to be the example.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.168 align:middle line:84%
I have to show you this
video because it really

00:39:32.168 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
tells a lot about
motivating the teen spirit.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.222 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:39:36.222 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Motivating the
Teen Spirit has been around

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.030 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
As of June of 2008
we've had the pleasure

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of transforming lives
of over 210,000 teens.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We've had the pleasure of having
a track record where we've

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
prevented, on record
as of June of 2008,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:90%
over 3,053 teen suicides.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We are committed
to teaching teens

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
how to put words
to their feelings,

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:84%
how to look at what's
going on on the inside,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and make sure it doesn't
cause a reaction or an action

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
in alignment with,

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
a result that they can
manage and be proud of.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Motivating the Teen Spirit has
worked for years, since 2000,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
teaching teens how to make
integrity-based decisions

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.768 align:middle line:84%
and how to fall madly
in love with themselves.

00:40:18.768 --> 00:40:22.321 align:middle line:84%
>>I learned from my words that
I could really hurt somebody

00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:23.862 align:middle line:84%
because the day that
my brother died,

00:40:23.862 --> 00:40:26.107 align:middle line:84%
we had got in like
a big, big fight,

00:40:26.107 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and we were fist-fighting
like all throughout the house.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.992 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him like I
hate you, and I don't love you,

00:40:30.992 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and you not my brother.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.533 align:middle line:84%
The first words that
come out my mouth

00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
should be thought about
before I actually say them.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: We're
excited about where

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:84%
we get to be because we believe
that with the skill sets

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that we offer teens,
and we're considered

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
to be the top 1% in
self-development for teens.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>One of my biggest
challenges that

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Motivating the Teen
Spirit has helped me with

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
was actually talking about
the situation with my father.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
With him being in jail, I was
kind of like, I didn't really

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:84%
want to touch on that
subject because it brought up

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
too many feelings that I
didn't want to deal with.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.035 align:middle line:84%
And so talking about
him kind of like

00:41:07.035 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
helped me have a better
relationship with him

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.605 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't see
each other that much.

00:41:11.605 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me actually
realize that what he did

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:84%
wasn't-- it wasn't his
choice to be away from me,

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that it was something
that he did.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.054 align:middle line:84%
And he just had to
pay the price for it.

00:41:23.054 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: We allow
teens and show teens

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:84%
how to be a part of
their own breakthrough.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We work with parents.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
It's an interactive
experiential learning program,

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.780 align:middle line:84%
which means we're not
dictating all the time.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not a monologue.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a dialogue.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.095 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation
between them and us.

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And I believe no
one knows what's

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:84%
going on in a young adult's
life better than they do.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And we give them a
safe space-- key word--

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
a safe space to identify
what's up for them.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:84%
How is their integrity in
alignment with their vision?

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
How do they put words
to a particular feeling?

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.757 align:middle line:84%
How do they stop a
freight train from going

00:41:56.757 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong direction
and turn around

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and go in the right direction?

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:90%
How do they find the voice?

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.590 align:middle line:84%
How does that shy
teen find their voice?

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>I know it must have made
you feel really unhappy when

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you saw your little girl
trying to commit suicide.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.585 align:middle line:84%
I learned that I
have more potential.

00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I learned that I'm
more confident.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I learned that I can be
more honest with myself now

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:90%
from the way I feel.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I learned that you
guys do love me,

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that you guys do care
about me, or else you

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.534 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be standing
here in front of me.

00:42:32.534 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said that
you felt that you were--

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought that you
were born as a orator,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and that you have had past
lives speaking in Greek stages.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But you said you were
born to help teens.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: God put breath in my
body to transform teen lives.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm very clear on
my life assignment,

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:84%
very clear on why
I'm here, very clear

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.997 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm supposed to do.

00:42:51.997 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Like that's my assignment.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you did that
before you had a teenager.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I did.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You get your assignment when
you get your assignment.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:90%
I got it a long time ago.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
When I had Jayloni
in my belly, I

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.900 align:middle line:84%
was mentoring 62 little girls
in South Central Los Angeles off

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of Normandy and Manchester
where the civil unrest was.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you were how old?

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: I was 26.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I was 26.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I started mentoring teenage
girls when I was 23.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I created this program
when I was about 28.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
it ever sense.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And clear, clear that this is
why I was born, crystal clear.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time I do it,
every cell in my body

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:84%
comes alive like I've
never seen before.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do we get there?

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we get there
to get in touch

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that deeply with
our life's purpose?

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: Take your
head out the game first.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Quit thinking how can
I make money at it.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Quit thinking I need
to earn a living.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes your head
and your chatter

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
interrupts your purpose,
it interrupts your heart.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find your
sole purpose in your soul.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find your soulness

00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in your gut and your belly.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.980 align:middle line:90%
It's between here and here.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
That imaginary
baby in your belly

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.010 align:middle line:90%
is going to jump when you do it.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.899 align:middle line:90%
And you've already done it.

00:44:06.899 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You've already done
it so many times.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It's when you talk to kids,

The hair on the
back of your neck.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:84%
The hair on all
my head stands up.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:84%

back of your neck--

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're constantly
inspired then, right?

00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:29.370 align:middle line:90%

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:30.725 align:middle line:90%
But you'll feel it.

00:44:30.725 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people walk toward
that, walk toward that feeling.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your
head interrupt it.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It may not be what
you do for a fee.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It may be what you do for free.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I look at Dr. King.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Dr. King did it for free.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I look at Mahatma Gandhi.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Mahatma Gandhi did it for free.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I look at Mother Teresa.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.380 align:middle line:90%
She gave everything and did it.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I look at Nelson Mandela.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:01.580 align:middle line:84%

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:19.830 align:middle line:90%
It's your breath assignment.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.839 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

I have six best-sellers.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I've sat next to Larry

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.084 align:middle line:84%

>>NICHOLS: Its so way beyond.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.028 align:middle line:90%
I got a fail in English.

OK?

00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:03.611 align:middle line:90%
I've just got to tell you.

00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I got a fail in English and a
D minus in Speech, same year.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I got seven
figures to do the book that

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.190 align:middle line:84%
had my face on the
cover-- you know,

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I expected to do good
with "The Secret"

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.470 align:middle line:84%
because there were so
many brilliant people.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can kind of hide
in between brilliant people.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And if it does well, you can go
it's because of him or because

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:90%

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when I did
"Chicken Soup for the Soul,"

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:24.786 align:middle line:84%
and it was so wildly
successful, I go well,

00:47:24.786 --> 00:47:26.160 align:middle line:84%
it's "Chicken Soup
for the Soul."

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.243 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be great.

00:47:27.243 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I did "No Matter What,"
and it was my chocolate face

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
on the cover and my
Afro, I was nervous.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But when someone gave me
seven figures for that book,

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.330 align:middle line:90%
they said we love you.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.330 align:middle line:90%
That was what that said.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.871 align:middle line:84%
We love you, and we
adore you, and we

00:47:42.871 --> 00:47:45.260 align:middle line:84%
want to share you
with the world.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what else
to dream for after that.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just who
you are though, Lisa.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.994 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is.

00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:50.993 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I didn't know
what else to dream for.

00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:90%
So I prayed to God.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.681 align:middle line:84%
God, what should I be
doing in this season?

00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And what came back to
me was teach others.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Teach others how
to build a brand,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.990 align:middle line:84%
how to build a international
message, how to serve millions,

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:84%
how to touch people
on multiple platforms,

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.520 align:middle line:84%
books, CDs, voice, stage,
live, video, show them.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So I said OK because
that's what I do.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm obedient.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So this whole
season I'm committed

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to taking brilliant
minds like you who

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.380 align:middle line:84%

the radio and put you

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.080 align:middle line:84%
on stage in front of several
hundred hungry people.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.927 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:48:24.927 --> 00:48:25.885 align:middle line:90%
We did that a year ago.

00:48:25.885 --> 00:48:26.509 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --ever.

00:48:26.509 --> 00:48:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I had never been on stage.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't stand
it for a second.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And then you did it.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You said get up there
and show your greatness.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And your audience
is so gracious.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.940 align:middle line:84%
They're so beautiful the
way that they just received.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of my self-chatter was
not going on in their heads.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And they made that appeared
apparent very fast.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: That's the season
I'm in is to teach people

sitting in the parking lot.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting and just
tears streaming down

you tell people

who have had and will
have in the future tragedy

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that's happened
in our home town,

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.920 align:middle line:84%
in Newtown, in Boston, in New
York, and wherever it has?

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:84%
How do you express your
greatness into them

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.914 align:middle line:90%
when they have massive loss?

00:49:31.914 --> 00:49:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: May I look

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: So what I would
say to anyone, to you

00:49:36.429 --> 00:49:39.270 align:middle line:84%
if you've experienced
any type of breakdown,

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.265 align:middle line:84%
emotional, spiritual,
financial, physical

00:49:43.265 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is to always remember that the
human spirit is unbreakable.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Your human spirit is
untouchable, it's unstoppable.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Your human spirit isn't
even available to a tragedy.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Your body, your emotions
can be impacted,

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.500 align:middle line:84%
but your human spirit
will always stay intact.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you can feel the
ground, then you can get up.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.380 align:middle line:84%
If you can feel, if you
have life in your body,

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.430 align:middle line:84%
then it's your birthright
not just to turn your crawl

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.510 align:middle line:84%
into a walk, your
walk into a run,

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.380 align:middle line:84%
but to turn your
run into a soar.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:90%
That's your birthright.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Simply because you have
breath in your body,

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can hear my voice,
that's your birthright.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And don't you dare let a bomber,
a shooter, or anyone else

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.330 align:middle line:90%
take that right from you.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Show them what you're made of.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:84%
In the most positive,
conscious, aware, loving space,

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.310 align:middle line:84%
love truly can bring
brightness to any dark corner.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And you just remember
that in this moment

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I said if you lack
faith, borrow mine

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.260 align:middle line:90%

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.580 align:middle line:90%

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.245 align:middle line:84%

if you have to hide it,

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and If you have to defend
it-- my grandmother says baby,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.110 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing to hide, nothing
to defend, nothing to protect,

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and nothing to prove.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that you

>>NICHOLS: On my journey?

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.751 align:middle line:84%
Mmm, I'd keep working
out after college.

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd work out a little
more consistently.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:84%

I would've loved me
more to get here.

I wouldn't have
judged me so much.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I would've stretched to see
myself through the lenses

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.692 align:middle line:84%
that you see me through,
versus the lenses

00:51:55.692 --> 00:51:57.150 align:middle line:84%

00:52:05.095 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:90%
get to know what I know at 47.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.610 align:middle line:84%

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.193 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.913 align:middle line:84%

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.351 align:middle line:90%

00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm a girl.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:90%

And so I think if I had
anything to do differently-- I

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.560 align:middle line:84%
appreciate all my battle wounds
because the battle wound is

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.310 align:middle line:84%
a part of my victory v. My
battle wound is only half

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.700 align:middle line:90%
of my victory v.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.920 align:middle line:84%

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I am the woman I am
today because I got up

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:53.706 align:middle line:90%
from this, and this, and this.

00:52:53.706 --> 00:52:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be the same

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sorry that I had to
get on government's assistance

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.715 align:middle line:90%
and stand in the WIC line.

00:53:07.715 --> 00:53:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sorry that I
didn't have Pampers

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to put on my son or
food to feed him.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not upset that I got
failed in English and in Speech

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.485 align:middle line:84%

never write or speak.

>>LISA: You don't say,
at any moment, God,

>>NICHOLS: No, not at all.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:28.320 align:middle line:84%

part of my flame,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that was the log that had
to be put in the fire.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.665 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be who I am today.

00:53:34.665 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And in order to love
who you are today,

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:84%
you have to embrace
every single part.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:46.710 align:middle line:84%
The goodbyes that I didn't
want to give to my grandmother,

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to the people that I love.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.244 align:middle line:90%
Something in me had to rise.

00:53:50.244 --> 00:53:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Here's what you
have to understand

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.310 align:middle line:90%
about a breakthrough.

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Something in you has to
rise that didn't even

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.280 align:middle line:84%
exist before to get from
breakdown to breakthrough.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to hear that, Lisa.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.136 align:middle line:84%
If you go through
something right now,

00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
you can't get through it if
you've never gone through it.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can't get
through it without something

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.890 align:middle line:84%
from your character,
perseverance, determination,

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:14.620 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness that you didn't
know you had it to that depth,

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.350 align:middle line:90%
rising to a higher level.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.900 align:middle line:84%
See, your breakdowns
and your breakthroughs

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:84%

you're becoming.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, that's the thing is
it's somewhere in between then,

over-worked and super-developed.

>>NICHOLS: So then
movement means proving.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: See, I--
we can keep going.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:02.970 align:middle line:90%
We'll find the core.

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Movement means proving.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So then I would ask
you the question,

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:09.895 align:middle line:84%
who are you proving
it to and why?

00:56:09.895 --> 00:56:11.985 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
guarantee, but I can almost

00:56:11.985 --> 00:56:13.580 align:middle line:90%
guarantee you this, Lisa.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You're proving to something
that you've already

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:18.290 align:middle line:84%
outlived, something
you've already done.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an old conversation
that you had as a child

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.340 align:middle line:84%
or as a teenager that was
brought on by a mother,

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.870 align:middle line:84%
by a father, by a boyfriend,
by someone early on.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.255 align:middle line:90%
And it kicked you in overdrive.

00:56:29.255 --> 00:56:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And you said never again.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
what a gentleman told me.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.804 align:middle line:90%
1999 or 2000, I got an award.

00:56:40.804 --> 00:56:42.262 align:middle line:84%
And when I got up
to get the award,

00:56:42.262 --> 00:56:46.290 align:middle line:84%
it was a very conscious
community in meditation,

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:47.880 align:middle line:90%
much like this community.

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I got up to get
the award, and I

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
was like I'm going to make
it, with you or without you.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a total misfit.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And this generous man
pulled me to the back.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who
gave me the award.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And he goes you had to fight
to get out of South Central.

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I said I sure did.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And you had to
prove it to people.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:08.050 align:middle line:90%
I said I sure did.

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.800 align:middle line:90%
He said and you did.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And now you need to tell
yourself you already proved it.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: So I tell you
you've already proven it.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we dig deeper
on another time,

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:90%
we'll know what that thing is.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll realize
oh, I already proved it.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to tell myself.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I forgot-- I
forgot to tell myself.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: I've been so busy
being busy, being busy, being

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:84%
busy that I forgot to tell
myself that I'm enough.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm enough.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:41.052 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I was
then, but now I'm enough.

00:57:41.052 --> 00:57:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have lost
track of all time.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that we are
wrapping it up here.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just invite listeners
with what exactly you just said.

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You are enough.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.082 align:middle line:90%


00:57:59.082 --> 00:58:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: You're welcome.

00:58:01.083 --> 00:58:02.356 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:58:02.356 --> 00:58:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This pleasure's
always mine with you.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: My
pleasure, we share.

00:58:06.035 --> 00:58:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks, Lis.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: We share it, and I
want you to know that as I hope

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:09.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm a gift to you--

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.501 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:58:10.501 --> 00:58:11.876 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLS: --you're
a gift to me.

00:58:11.876 --> 00:58:15.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a mutual,
reciprocal relationship.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Always,
my sister, always.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:18.646 align:middle line:90%
>>NICHOLS: You're welcome.

00:58:18.646 --> 00:58:19.362 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I love you, too.

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
listening and share,

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.400 align:middle line:84%
share, share, share the
interview with friends.

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Go share it.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Go to gaiamtv.com, share
it with your friends,

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.240 align:middle line:90%
let them know they're enough.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:53.767 align:middle line:90%
