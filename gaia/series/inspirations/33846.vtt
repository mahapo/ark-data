>> Lisa Garr: Hi.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.054 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.125 align:middle line:84%
My guess today Adam C. Hall
achieved what was called the

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:24.925 align:middle line:90%
American Dream.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.694 align:middle line:90%
He was real estate tycoon,

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.562 align:middle line:84%
everything in his
life was great.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:32.566 align:middle line:84%
And then he undertook a
life changing metamorphosis

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.002 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately altered his mind

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.105 align:middle line:84%
from earth conqueror
to earth keeper.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.507 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show Adam.

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:40.875 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:41.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Adam C. Hall: You bet Lisa.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.244 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
here with you today.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What a journey
you've been on, what a journey.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:48.015 align:middle line:84%
A typical hero's journey,
I guess we could call it.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.118 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us a little
bit about your life

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:54.255 align:middle line:84%
when you are a real estate
tycoon and what led you

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:90%
into that type of lifestyle?

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam C. Hall: Absolutely,
be more than happy to

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.227 align:middle line:90%
and it really was that living

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that quintessential
American dream, Lisa.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.867 align:middle line:84%
I had-- I'm a product of
the '60s and '70s and '80s

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.804 align:middle line:84%
and it was really all
about what do we achieve.

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:11.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam C. Hall: What is that
American dream look like.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.676 align:middle line:84%
And so, I went off
to fulfill that dream

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:84%
that I thought I
was suppose to do.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:22.449 align:middle line:84%
I married my junior high school
sweetheart, a gorgeous woman

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:26.053 align:middle line:84%
and we have three amazing
lovely daughters together

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.589 align:middle line:84%
and the successful
real estate company

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:33.159 align:middle line:84%
and the country club and, you
know, the traveling around

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.162 align:middle line:84%
and all those accouterments
of life.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:40.534 align:middle line:84%
But when I got there something
was missing and I was unhappy.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Was it the stress
of it all that made you unhappy

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:46.307 align:middle line:84%
or was it-- was it a yearning
inside of you that said,

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:47.775 align:middle line:90%
"There's something more?"

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:48.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Adam C. Hall: You know,

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.446 align:middle line:84%
interestingly I actually
thrived on this stress.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Stress, oh.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:57.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam C. Hall: And I didn't
really enjoy popping the Tums

00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:58.718 align:middle line:90%
as much as I did.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.456 align:middle line:84%
There was something that drove
me hard around the excitement

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of hard charging the capitalist
word kind of what I refer

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.996 align:middle line:84%
to as the predatorily
capitalist world

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:12.866 align:middle line:84%
yet that wasn't what drove me to
it because I was blessed still

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
to have good health often
times health degenerates

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.738 align:middle line:90%
with stress and whatnot.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:18.239 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.209 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: So, I was fortunate that
that did not occur within me,

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.779 align:middle line:84%
something else was occurring
and I was determined to find

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.748 align:middle line:90%
out what was that all about.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.383 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But what did that
feel like, would you wake

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.719 align:middle line:84%
up every morning saying,
"OK, back to the daily grind"

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.221 align:middle line:84%
but there was no purpose
there, is that what you--

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.556 align:middle line:90%
what was that feeling like?

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.259 align:middle line:84%
I mean how did you know
something was missing?

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.362 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, I was-- like I was
sharing, I was really living

00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:44.732 align:middle line:84%
by this law of the jungle and
that is when the sun comes

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.634 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning
whether you're a lion

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.737 align:middle line:84%
or gazelle you better
run like hell.

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:52.538 align:middle line:84%
And one morning I was
driving down the PCH

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:56.543 align:middle line:84%
in my black Range Rover, on the
phone with me or doing a deal

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that got me all upset and a
dog ran in front of the car

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.449 align:middle line:84%
and I slammed on the breaks
and my heart almost jumped

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.688 align:middle line:84%
out of my chest and I said,
"My God, what is going on?

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.023 align:middle line:90%
What is happening here?"

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So, it spurred me on
to start to take a look

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.664 align:middle line:84%
and investigate what was
that, what can I do about it.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:19.133 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What was the-- I mean
that moment that you felt

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.503 align:middle line:84%
like what is happening with my
life, what am I really doing?

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:25.873 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Exactly, well it actually
occurred, I came home later

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:30.311 align:middle line:84%
in the day a little bit early
and I was down on the beach

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:33.647 align:middle line:84%
by myself and the sun was
setting and it was one

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of those beautiful sunsets
we have here in California.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:90%
And I just weld up in tears.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize that-- that
I needed to make some changes

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:50.998 align:middle line:84%
in my life and to find out what
really is my greater calling,

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:54.268 align:middle line:84%
you know, what is the
purpose for me being here

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.403 align:middle line:90%
because the narcissistic kind

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:59.473 align:middle line:84%
of hard charging life it
wasn't doing it for me.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:00.574 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What was your
relationship

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.443 align:middle line:84%
like with your family
at the time?

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:03.844 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: It was challenged.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:09.283 align:middle line:84%
I was very challenged, I'd often
leave before the sun comes up

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.719 align:middle line:84%
and everybody gets
up and gets going

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.488 align:middle line:84%
and then some evenings I
actually came home awfully late.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.826 align:middle line:84%
So, I was really missing
out on a lot of things

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.026 align:middle line:90%
around family life

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:24.765 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it became
a real issue with my wife

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.534 align:middle line:84%
and really became very
challenging and troubling

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle line:90%
so it begin a slow slide

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:34.875 align:middle line:84%
into a separation although we
were together but, you know,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.512 align:middle line:84%
these things kind of can be
like a slow dribble and even,

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
you know, marriage therapy

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.617 align:middle line:84%
and all those things sometimes
can help but sometimes not.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.017 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, the universe
is giving you,

00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:49.256 align:middle line:84%
is delivering you this wake up
calls, the dog, the separation,

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:52.359 align:middle line:84%
this moments that was-- was
really kind of forcing you

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.495 align:middle line:90%
to take a deeper look.

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:55.629 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.431 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, How did you
actually make that leap?

00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.032 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.568 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, it's interesting,
that's the big question

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:05.906 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in like in
the church and not a lot but--

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.876 align:middle line:84%
and that didn't have
any answers for me.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.446 align:middle line:84%
I attended with my mom at that
time and it was like, "Really,

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:13.847 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?"

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle line:84%
And I began to read voraciously
kind of east and west modalities

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.155 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom teachings

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:26.193 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately really gravitated
towards a lot of teachings

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
around indigenous
cultures of the Americas

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.267 align:middle line:84%
which is Native American
traditions, Mayan traditions,

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:37.604 align:middle line:84%
Incan traditions and
begin to experiencing--

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:84%
getting to an experience
with that.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So, it was really about
stepping out of the comfort zone

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.447 align:middle line:84%
of all the accouterments
that I was leaving

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.315 align:middle line:90%
and having to say, "OK.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.218 align:middle line:84%
OK, something kind of
pushing me along-- "

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.619 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Uh-huh.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.023 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: "Hence you're there" and
the willingness to say I've got

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.926 align:middle line:84%
to do this because
if I don't it--

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:02.763 align:middle line:84%
I may face some real
health issues or even a loss

00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.031 align:middle line:90%
of my soul so to speak.

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:04.565 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You're right.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.132 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:05.666 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Exactly.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:06.733 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:07.568 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then what
happens after that?

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:08.268 align:middle line:90%
So, then, you took a journey.

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:09.403 align:middle line:90%
You went into the woods.

00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:84%
Why particular the
woods called you?

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.975 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, it's the
quintessential woods and

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:19.446 align:middle line:84%
but the woods are obviously
analogies and symbolic

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.549 align:middle line:84%
for leaving the world
as you know it.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of goes into the
darker shadows and the lighting

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:31.291 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine any woods
set the magnificent of them

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:90%
and into the darkness of it.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.434 align:middle line:84%
And so, that quest, that
vision quest begin with going

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:84%
out into the desert and
really, the woods of the desert

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:47.608 align:middle line:84%
because you're just exposed
there to the open element

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:48.141 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.543 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:53.747 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And so, I first went off,
actually I decided that I wanted

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.451 align:middle line:84%
to leave at sunrise and I
did on Christmas morning

00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:00.787 align:middle line:84%
and I just headed down
the 10 Freeway in LA

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:04.191 align:middle line:84%
and just kept going in the
first stop by stop in Sedona

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.662 align:middle line:84%
and then went out into the
deserts and I share a lot

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:11.999 align:middle line:84%
of this fun and adventurous
and moving stories in the book.

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:13.934 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But this is what
most people are looking

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.641 align:middle line:84%
at you right now watching this
going, I could never do that

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.509 align:middle line:90%
but it's calling me too.

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.912 align:middle line:84%
What would you tell
someone like that?

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Well, the call

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.885 align:middle line:84%
to adventure I believe cannot
be denied and it's just that--

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:32.586 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No matter what.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.687 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: No matter what.

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:37.491 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's just really
a function of when.

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:40.394 align:middle line:84%
It's a not a matter if
you're going to do it.

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're going to do
it and you can hang around

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.233 align:middle line:84%
and spend this life
time and you can show

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.569 align:middle line:84%
up the next one and
hear their call.

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.605 align:middle line:90%
So, if not now then when?

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:84%
And so, I said, you
know, now is the time.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.811 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so, you took that
journey out towards the desert

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:01.515 align:middle line:84%
and out past into Sedona and
you never really turned back

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:02.015 align:middle line:90%
did you?

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: There was no
looking back Lisa.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.186 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.754 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Now, it is funny to say

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:11.124 align:middle line:84%
that because I was actually
can feel in this moment going

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:15.262 align:middle line:84%
down in 10 Freeway looking
in the rearview mirror.

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:15.963 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:17.364 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: And when I did,

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:21.134 align:middle line:84%
I actually pushed the
accelerator even more.

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:21.868 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Even more.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.936 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.171 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You knew you
weren't going back?

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.372 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: No, no.

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what
was in front of me either.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.942 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:33.046 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Other than I knew
that I begin to feel my heart

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:37.084 align:middle line:84%
and to want to explore
the fullness of that.

00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:38.785 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But I'm sure, it
was beating quite hard

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:41.655 align:middle line:84%
because you had so
many things set up.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.924 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were a major
real estate investor,

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:46.793 align:middle line:84%
I mean developer
in land management

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:49.463 align:middle line:84%
and in corporate real estate and
commercial real estate, right?

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And in Wall Street,

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:52.366 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
are going for you.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.501 align:middle line:84%
So, what happened to
all of those contexts?

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.138 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, first things first
and, you know, ultimately,

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:01.808 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
call was so loud

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:07.147 align:middle line:84%
which I too had been
ignoring, not listening.

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:11.485 align:middle line:84%
And then when I finally knew
that I needed to take the moment

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:14.454 align:middle line:84%
and listen, I really
heard that inner voice,

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:84%
the voice that was
calling and speaking to me

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and the book shares the
voice that came to me

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.429 align:middle line:90%
and said, "You're safe.

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:24.298 align:middle line:90%
You've been here.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:28.835 align:middle line:84%
It's time to take this journey
and we'll do it together."

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.171 align:middle line:90%
And-- but to do it, yeah,

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.707 align:middle line:84%
I can't just put you
toe in the water Adam.

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:36.476 align:middle line:84%
You need to really
show up big time, so.

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:37.277 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.146 align:middle line:90%
So, it was really a calling.

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:42.215 align:middle line:84%
It was another voice
that came inside of you.

00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:44.651 align:middle line:84%
It was almost your own
or was it another voice.

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:49.656 align:middle line:84%
>> It was another voice and
that voice was given a name

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.025 align:middle line:84%
in my book and her name is
Leila [assumed spelling].

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And very angelic energy
been whatever you believe

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it means to
you, we all have that voice

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.768 align:middle line:84%
and that voice was
very comforting

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:84%
because it had been
guiding my soul for lifetime

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime and honoring me.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:84%
And so, it became
a great teacher

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:84%
and a great Kalyana
Mitra which is a dear

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.018 align:middle line:90%
and noble friend and I--

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.119 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: One friend.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: I have one in
my life today as well

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.122 align:middle line:84%
and here name is Lizette
[assumed spelling].

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice, nice.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.027 align:middle line:84%
So, now, when you wrote the
book and it started a movement

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:30.597 align:middle line:84%
so to speak where it
created other people just

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.099 align:middle line:90%
as I'm inquiring right now

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:35.535 align:middle line:84%
and people are watching
saying identifying with you.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:38.839 align:middle line:84%
It created almost an energy
on its own, didn't it?

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:43.243 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: It really has and I'm
excited to say that it-- the--

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.279 align:middle line:84%
it really and I know this
may sound difficult Lisa

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:49.416 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't really have
anything to do with me.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.018 align:middle line:84%
I'm just holding the
greater capacity--

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:52.953 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yup.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.354 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: -- of this
indelible truth

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:59.192 align:middle line:84%
and I believe has called me
to embrace my greater humanity

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.094 align:middle line:90%
and the great depth of who I am.

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:01.628 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:02.729 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:04.131 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: -- it's about
transpersonal ecology

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:08.001 align:middle line:84%
and how our ecology and how we
relate to our total environment,

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.805 align:middle line:84%
both the outer and the inner
environment and how to bring in

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:16.176 align:middle line:84%
and wed those to sacred
aspects of the human journey?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.112 align:middle line:84%
So, that is really
reaching and touching people

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
because right now, we certainly
are faced with a lot of daunting

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.317 align:middle line:90%
and challenging things.

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:25.719 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:29.489 align:middle line:84%
Have you always been somewhat
of an environmentalist or aware

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:31.491 align:middle line:84%
of our current state
and statistics

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:35.695 align:middle line:84%
in our current environmental
process right now?

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.598 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: No, the answer
is no but I was blessed

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:44.004 align:middle line:84%
with my late beloved father who
often took my brothers and I

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:48.608 align:middle line:84%
up into this year as in
enjoy the mountain side,

00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:52.145 align:middle line:84%
my wonderful mother always
wanted to explore, you know,

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:54.781 align:middle line:84%
interesting places and
they are always outdoors

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:59.019 align:middle line:84%
and they were always
about the natural world.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So, unconsciously I guess, since
so many ways, I was connecting

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.659 align:middle line:90%
and feeling the power of that.

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:09.896 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of really as more
of a traditional activist,

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:15.435 align:middle line:84%
more as a greater student of
the environment, I was not

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:16.803 align:middle line:90%
and that's what was calling.

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:17.871 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:18.939 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: We all have
some calling somewhere.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:19.906 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Instinct.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.241 align:middle line:84%
Well, you definitely
found out a lot.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.343 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
at a video that explains some

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:24.511 align:middle line:90%
of what Adam discovered.

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.545 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:26.847 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: OK.

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.114 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, tonight, I like to
share with you a little bit

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:31.618 align:middle line:84%
about my journey from
being an earth conqueror

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:34.654 align:middle line:84%
to being an earth
preservationist.

00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:37.724 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk a
little bit about what I'm doing

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:84%
but really going to focus a
little bit about what I'm being

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:45.498 align:middle line:84%
because they become
one in the same things.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:48.468 align:middle line:84%
And so, I invite you
on a journey with me

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:55.208 align:middle line:84%
to hear a little bit about how I
come from Adam 1.0 to Adam 2.0.

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And for whatever it's worth.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.015 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so here's my
front page right now.

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It kind of give you a little
glimpse into my inner world--

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.723 align:middle line:84%
my inner headline so to
speak and some of the things

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:12.692 align:middle line:84%
that I am really concerned
about, it's happening

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:90%
on this planet at the moment.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:19.766 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there's 49 million
Americans that live in poverty,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:24.437 align:middle line:84%
16.7 million of them
are children.

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:84%
One in five children each
and everyday in America

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.577 align:middle line:84%
at some point in
time goes hungry,

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:34.848 align:middle line:84%
hard to believe,
but true, children.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:38.318 align:middle line:84%
Two, a few weeks
ago, the Department

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:42.155 align:middle line:84%
of Agriculture released
a study that show

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:48.361 align:middle line:84%
that beehive colonies decline
last winter, 31 percent.

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.497 align:middle line:84%
As we know, these little
worker bees are the ones

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.966 align:middle line:90%
that pollinate our food.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:59.039 align:middle line:84%
No food, no bees, no food, my
goodness, pretty serious issue.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.842 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact in
California the production

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.412 align:middle line:84%
of almonds and that's
declined so dramatically

00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:08.214 align:middle line:84%
that prices have nearly
tripled now and this is all

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:11.017 align:middle line:90%
because of a pesticide.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.186 align:middle line:90%
And this pesticide is produced

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:17.057 align:middle line:84%
by the biggest producers a
company called Bear [phonetic].

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people
that brought us poison gas

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.663 align:middle line:84%
in World War II and now
we are poisoning our food

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:25.832 align:middle line:84%
and we are poisoning
Mother Nature.

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:28.335 align:middle line:90%
Two, food.

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Three, just a couple weeks
ago, some of you probably heard

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.811 align:middle line:84%
that scientist for the
first time ever revealed

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:39.212 align:middle line:90%
that CO2 levels

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:44.551 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere are now have
reached 400 parts per million

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.321 align:middle line:84%
and this is the threshold that
they all said would be the place

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:90%
where there was no looking back.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:53.893 align:middle line:84%
You think we've seen
climate change,

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.863 align:middle line:90%
we haven't seen nothing yet.

00:14:56.863 --> 00:15:01.167 align:middle line:84%
Four, you probably
heard about the plight

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:05.905 align:middle line:84%
of these young ladies, these
young women in the Midwest

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:12.278 align:middle line:84%
that were abducted, I mean
tragically for over a decade.

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:18.651 align:middle line:84%
And no disrespect to them
but for much in my life,

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
perhaps for decades, I too felt
abducted although the abductor

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.128 align:middle line:90%
for me was my own ego.

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:32.799 align:middle line:84%
It was my own narcissistic
self serving predatory

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.734 align:middle line:90%
capitalist ways.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.807 align:middle line:84%
Best news of all, the best
news of all that gives me

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:45.645 align:middle line:84%
so much hope and so much
promise for tomorrow.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:49.716 align:middle line:84%
It's in my-- kind of
the little finer print

00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:52.685 align:middle line:84%
and it comes on the
heals of 2012.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.355 align:middle line:90%
And as a matter of fact,

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:59.926 align:middle line:84%
it's not with self help
people want you to hear

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:03.329 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to be the
last one to get this news

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:90%
but we are all enlightened.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.636 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that means for
you, we are all enlightened.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:14.274 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in this room,
everybody in this town,

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:19.379 align:middle line:84%
everybody in this state,
everybody in this great country

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:23.983 align:middle line:84%
of ours and all around the
globe, we are all enlightened.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:29.556 align:middle line:84%
There's only one problem,
most of us don't know it.

00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.658 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, what do you mean
by that that we don't know

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:32.625 align:middle line:90%
that we're enlightened.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.127 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are
daunting statistics.

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:35.862 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
more a little bit later on.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:36.963 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Sure.

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.264 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Is it too late?

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:41.234 align:middle line:84%
Are we beyond the
point of return?

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, the answer
is absolutely not,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:51.177 align:middle line:84%
and but one thing that we are
beyond is living in a lifestyle

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.614 align:middle line:84%
in an economy that
is unsustainable.

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:58.885 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we will
see a lot of great effects

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to not
only some of the things

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:02.489 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
with climate change.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:04.957 align:middle line:84%
And let's keep in mind,
climate change isn't just

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.225 align:middle line:90%
global warming.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
That's what it is for now
but at some point in time,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.331 align:middle line:84%
everything's got to
cool back down again.

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.765 align:middle line:84%
And the earth has gone
through this cycle.

00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:15.135 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:19.172 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: So, we're not beyond
anything other than that we need

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.508 align:middle line:90%
to move beyond the old story.

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:24.543 align:middle line:84%
And what I was sharing
in that short little clip

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:29.182 align:middle line:84%
about being enlightened that
we already are enlightened,

00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:33.019 align:middle line:84%
what I found is that is
a natural state of being.

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:36.856 align:middle line:84%
And what occurred for me was
that that I just had in sheath,

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle line:84%
I had layered upon
layer of story.

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:45.365 align:middle line:84%
I need more of this and I need
this fixed, a bigger house

00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.066 align:middle line:84%
and I need to have
these friends, you know,

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.937 align:middle line:84%
I need to be somebody but
that wasn't who I truly was.

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:57.277 align:middle line:84%
So, the enlightenment was became
very evident once we begin

00:17:57.277 --> 00:18:00.513 align:middle line:84%
to remove a lot of
those impediments.

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:02.649 align:middle line:84%
And I see that in
every human being.

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:03.316 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.617 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: We see that.

00:18:04.617 --> 00:18:07.187 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In that state that
you were in with the wanting

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:10.757 align:middle line:84%
to acquire more and have the
bigger house and the status

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:14.194 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, did you feel
in that place that it was--

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:17.664 align:middle line:84%
you were just trapped,
that there was no movement

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:20.366 align:middle line:84%
in that space in
your life, no growth?

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes, and that was part
of coming to that pinnacle

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle line:84%
of ultimately success but
it was also felt suffocating

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways because within
me, there was a greater yearning

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.417 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget on
that vision quest that I went

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:41.721 align:middle line:84%
on in the Indian nation
when I got on a mustang

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:46.292 align:middle line:84%
that have been taken off the
ranch off the Indian nation four

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.329 align:middle line:84%
years before and
her name was Angel

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:51.698 align:middle line:84%
and I barely every
ridden a pony.

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:54.267 align:middle line:90%
I rode one at my 7th birthday

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:57.437 align:middle line:84%
over Griffith Park just beyond
the corner for our studio here.

00:18:57.437 --> 00:18:58.571 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:01.407 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And I got on that
pony and begin to ride

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:90%
and I begin to feel the freedom.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.578 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of the wild let's say.

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Of just-- of the
wild mustang and the idea

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:13.453 align:middle line:84%
that I could make this break
for my own personal liberation

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:16.756 align:middle line:84%
from this old story and all
the wounds and the hurts

00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:18.524 align:middle line:84%
that I've been carrying
of my lifetime,

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.993 align:middle line:90%
or lifetime for that matter.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.261 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Lifetimes, what a great
analogy, what a great analogy.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.667 align:middle line:84%
So, in that space though,
when you got into that horse

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and using that analogy,
you found that sense

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.272 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment
or joy within you

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that you believe every
single person has.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.743 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes, very much so.

00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:40.413 align:middle line:84%
It's really just a
matter of tapping into it

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:44.384 align:middle line:84%
and allowing a surrender
because ultimately, you know,

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:48.721 align:middle line:84%
the greater power of nature
that really came forth is

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:90%
that everything works so--

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:54.093 align:middle line:84%
it's so in symbiosis and
everything is supporting,

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:55.762 align:middle line:90%
everything else in nature.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:59.999 align:middle line:84%
And even in its deafened demise
it has support for other parts

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
of the entire ecosystem and of
course here I was not living

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.173 align:middle line:84%
in a harmony with the natural
law and the natural way

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:08.474 align:middle line:90%
that the universe works.

00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:11.911 align:middle line:84%
So, it was time for me to
get into that natural world

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:13.379 align:middle line:90%
and live harmonically with it.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.048 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I can see how this
has become a movement

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:19.052 align:middle line:84%
and I can see despond on
many other people who are

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:22.555 align:middle line:84%
in the same quest that you
are to get back to something

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.858 align:middle line:84%
that is its sustainable,
that is sustainable.

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have, well, you
started the EarthKeeper Alliance

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:32.632 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that we
have a clip about right now

00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
that you can take a look at.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.835 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this clip and
we'll go into a little bit more

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:36.803 align:middle line:90%
about the EarthKeeper Alliance.

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:37.971 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: OK, yeah, let's do that.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:44.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Male: [Background Music]
We invite you on a journey

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:47.914 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill your legacy and be
a part of something greater

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:52.218 align:middle line:84%
than yourself, to enjoy
the land and all its gifts.

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:55.288 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the EarthKeeper
Alliance.

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:58.091 align:middle line:84%
Let me introduce you
to the lead visionary

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.926 align:middle line:90%
of this wonderful campaign.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.862 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Hi, I'm Adam
Hall, Founding Steward

00:21:02.862 --> 00:21:05.098 align:middle line:90%
of the EarthKeeper Alliance.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
After 22 years in the real
estate land development

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:84%
business, I woke up and
realize that the old paradigm

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:16.809 align:middle line:84%
of maximizing land development
rights was not sustainable.

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:18.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Male: With a group
of dedicated leaders,

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
we came up with a
way to give back.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.583 align:middle line:90%
We call it Undevelopment.

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:26.486 align:middle line:84%
Undevelopment is taking large
tracks of land that is slated

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:28.688 align:middle line:84%
for development and
restoring them back

00:21:28.688 --> 00:21:31.491 align:middle line:84%
to their natural state
permanently preserving

00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.892 align:middle line:90%
the ecosystem.

00:21:32.892 --> 00:21:36.763 align:middle line:84%
We recently conserved 90 percent
of the Red Tail Ranch located

00:21:36.763 --> 00:21:39.332 align:middle line:90%
in Big Sur California.

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:42.301 align:middle line:84%
We reduce the development
rights nearly in half.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.637 align:middle line:90%
It will forever remain wild.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:50.877 align:middle line:84%
>> AH. Not long ago I was
living the picture perfect life

00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:55.615 align:middle line:90%
but guess what, I was unhappy.

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:59.185 align:middle line:84%
I lived by what I now
know as a great myth,

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:01.087 align:middle line:90%
the law of the jungle.

00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:05.291 align:middle line:84%
When the sun comes up whether
you're a lion or gazelle,

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.226 align:middle line:90%
you better run like hell.

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:09.362 align:middle line:90%
Eat or be eaten.

00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:12.465 align:middle line:84%
Henry David Thoreau
had it right.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:15.768 align:middle line:84%
In wilderness is the
preservation of the world.

00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:19.705 align:middle line:84%
What I found exploring the
Amazon jungle and the wilderness

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of Big Sur was the
preservation of myself.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.113 align:middle line:84%
An EarthKeeper is one
who tends to our planet,

00:22:27.113 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
people and honors the
sacredness of our humanity.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.019 align:middle line:84%
In order to be an
EarthKeeper I realized

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.222 align:middle line:84%
that I must first
clean up my own garden.

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.491 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the EarthKeeper
to share the rawness

00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:41.461 align:middle line:90%
of my humanity words and all.

00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:43.429 align:middle line:90%
Each of us has a gift.

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:46.599 align:middle line:84%
Each of us plays a vital
role on the planet.

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:48.768 align:middle line:90%
We are love and loved.

00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:52.071 align:middle line:84%
We are people of
destiny not merely fate.

00:22:52.071 --> 00:22:54.907 align:middle line:84%
My intentions for the
book are to inspire others

00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
to realize the magnificence
of their being.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.781 align:middle line:84%
We are after all the ones
we've been waiting for.

00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: OK, so the
concept of undevelopment,

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.053 align:middle line:84%
what is that, what
does that mean?

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.521 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Well, it's an outgrowth,

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.723 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share a little
backdrop and a root kind

00:23:10.723 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:90%
of the roots of that, Lisa.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.862 align:middle line:84%
It really is an outgrowth of
the journey that I went on

00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:18.197 align:middle line:84%
and we were actually just
talking a little bit about that

00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately I had to
surrender that old story.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:27.773 align:middle line:84%
I had to let it go and let it
die away as a matter of fact.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:31.677 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, I essentially was

00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:36.182 align:middle line:84%
about un-developing my
life, not developing more,

00:23:36.182 --> 00:23:39.185 align:middle line:84%
not about trying to what
is this, what is that,

00:23:39.185 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
trying to understand things

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.422 align:middle line:84%
from a real linear
left brain perspective

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.092 align:middle line:84%
because that was only
creating more questions

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.827 align:middle line:90%
or more confusions.

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:90%
But my teachings and experience

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:54.133 align:middle line:84%
that I had was there was
something really powerful

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.903 align:middle line:84%
that could happen
instantaneously that occurred

00:23:56.903 --> 00:24:02.808 align:middle line:84%
for me when I was in a process
of un-developing story and past

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:07.113 align:middle line:84%
and wound so when I would visit
parts of my life like when I was

00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
on fire as a 12-year-old
young man playing with fire

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.121 align:middle line:84%
in the playground, you know, all
the things you're not supposed

00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:16.923 align:middle line:90%
to do and caught on fire,

00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:20.726 align:middle line:84%
ultimately that created a
deep psychological wounding

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:23.563 align:middle line:84%
in my life and that never
was healed but it was there.

00:24:23.563 --> 00:24:25.765 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of filed
away in the drawer.

00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:30.903 align:middle line:84%
So, all the way going to that
place an un-developing story.

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:31.837 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I see.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.005 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: It was a process

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:36.842 align:middle line:84%
of allowing a great
healing and releasing it.

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:40.313 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
releasing came the liberation

00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:43.482 align:middle line:90%
and the freedom from that story,

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.751 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately
allowed room--

00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:46.719 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: For something
else to come in

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.825 align:middle line:84%
and that something else was the
creative power of the universe.

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:56.128 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you took your energy
back from many of your stories

00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:59.999 align:middle line:84%
and use that energy towards
a greater good essentially.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.133 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: I like how you said that.

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:04.503 align:middle line:84%
You took back that
story because ultimately

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.273 align:middle line:90%
that story was not serving me.

00:25:07.273 --> 00:25:08.474 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:10.509 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And often times
unconsciously and no clue.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:11.711 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Like reclaimed water.

00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:15.114 align:middle line:84%
I mean you get to reclaim
that energy and bring it

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:17.016 align:middle line:84%
into something that's
greater and good.

00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:17.783 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:18.751 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, the alliance
then formed

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.254 align:middle line:90%
around many different people,

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:25.191 align:middle line:84%
the EarthKeeper Alliance,
how did that form?

00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:29.629 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, it came about
as I came back from the woods

00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:33.299 align:middle line:90%
and it was like what do I do?

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:36.068 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing the world.

00:25:36.068 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.505 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Should I-- wait a second,
I don't want to live in a TV.

00:25:39.505 --> 00:25:40.606 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:42.008 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: I don't want
to live in an Ashram,

00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:43.809 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with any of that.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:45.177 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: That's all cool stuff
but that was what I was yearning

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to do 'cause I felt the
greater good of my own life

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.354 align:middle line:84%
and my life expression would
be best in a place of service,

00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:58.624 align:middle line:84%
be best in a place to show
up for the greater good.

00:25:58.624 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course not only of my
own personal life and that

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
of my family but to
show up in a world

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.599 align:middle line:84%
about something I really
cared about and the gift

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:09.835 align:middle line:84%
of the environment and
mother nature that I received

00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:11.237 align:middle line:90%
out in the wilderness.

00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I received-- every single day I
figured the least I could do was

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.076 align:middle line:90%
to honor her and to do work

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:20.279 align:middle line:84%
that would support a greater
awareness and the power

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:23.549 align:middle line:84%
of our own ecology to
connect with the environment.

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:25.251 align:middle line:90%
And I believe this is something

00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that it can effectuate the
kind change and the kind

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:84%
of things we need to
do and humanity to deal

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:32.258 align:middle line:84%
with the things that
we're facing.

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:37.129 align:middle line:84%
So, we came back and I founded
the EarthKeeper Alliance

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:40.633 align:middle line:84%
and a new paradigm around
real estate undevelopment

00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:42.368 align:middle line:90%
to limit development.

00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:43.803 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a capitalist.

00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:47.373 align:middle line:84%
I still enjoy making the book
and it's just not a matter

00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:50.342 align:middle line:84%
of doing it off somebody
else's back, and about doing it

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:51.777 align:middle line:90%
in consort with the earth.

00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:53.579 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Explain that
a little bit more.

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:56.949 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, it's really
about what we do and kind

00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.718 align:middle line:84%
of give you kind of the
meat and potatoes of it

00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
so to speak was it's the
acquiring a track of land.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We did that in Big Sur
as a matter of fact.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.826 align:middle line:84%
And which is a more of
this piece of property

00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:10.496 align:middle line:84%
that went fallen into a
greater state of disrepair.

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Uh-huh.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.798 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: And it had development,

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:16.869 align:middle line:84%
rights and development
potentials associated with that.

00:27:16.869 --> 00:27:18.938 align:middle line:84%
And my partner and
myself decided, well,

00:27:18.938 --> 00:27:21.707 align:middle line:90%
let's do some conservation work.

00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:22.975 align:middle line:90%
Let's preserve the property.

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's clean it up first of all.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.681 align:middle line:84%
Let's recultivate the land,
replant the land, rejuvenate

00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:30.116 align:middle line:90%
and repurpose the land.

00:27:30.116 --> 00:27:32.518 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What was it designated
for, the development?

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:35.588 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: It was-- it had
development rights on

00:27:35.588 --> 00:27:39.525 align:middle line:84%
and so it ultimately could have
been built into several types

00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:42.461 align:middle line:84%
of homes on this very
special sacred property,

00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:44.063 align:middle line:90%
actually Indian property.

00:27:44.063 --> 00:27:46.031 align:middle line:84%
So, in the conservation
easements,

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:50.136 align:middle line:84%
they allow for protection in
perpetuity, into the other time

00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:53.606 align:middle line:84%
but we kept enough development
right that would allow us

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:55.541 align:middle line:90%
to have some further development

00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:58.444 align:middle line:84%
so it could still be
a profitable endeavor.

00:27:58.444 --> 00:27:59.812 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:27:59.812 --> 00:28:04.049 align:middle line:84%
So, you kind of combined both
where you could still build

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
on the land to make it
sustainable to the people

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.355 align:middle line:90%
and to the area around you

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:12.858 align:middle line:84%
but you also preserved a certain
part of the land that needs

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:90%
to just be undeveloped.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.227 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.529 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And do both.

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:18.764 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Exactly, you do both
so it's kind of a hybrid.

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:22.168 align:middle line:84%
In other words, well, we're
doing something for profit

00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:27.206 align:middle line:84%
yet at the same time we're
balancing it with a social good,

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:29.308 align:middle line:84%
something that is
socially beneficial

00:28:29.308 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
to the community, to the planet.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.582 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's creating that
more harmonic balance to speak

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:40.085 align:middle line:84%
between human imprint and
what is natural to the earth.

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you also do this
in various parts of the world.

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:45.191 align:middle line:84%
I understand we have a picture
here of a place in Hawaii

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:46.258 align:middle line:90%
that you're also doing--

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:48.527 align:middle line:84%
preserving a certain
amount of the coast.

00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:49.728 align:middle line:90%
What island is this on?

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:52.364 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: This is on the Big
Island in South Dakota.

00:28:52.364 --> 00:28:56.168 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazing
piece of property, Lisa.

00:28:56.168 --> 00:29:01.373 align:middle line:84%
And a dear friend of mine came
to me a very large developer

00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and was involved in this
project and still is.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.681 align:middle line:84%
And this project is on
60,000 acres and has

00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:11.584 align:middle line:84%
over 4-1/2 miles
of ocean frontage.

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:15.721 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be home to
what they say is the largest

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:19.992 align:middle line:84%
historical petroglyph
site in all of Polynesia.

00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:24.563 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Amongst a lot of endanger
species and they spent millions

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:26.732 align:middle line:84%
and millions of dollars
developing plants

00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to build thousands of
homes, hotels, golf courses,

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.272 align:middle line:90%
a commercial airstrip.

00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:34.673 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:37.009 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: But ultimately through
a confluence of great events,

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:39.144 align:middle line:84%
not only change in
economy but my--

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.479 align:middle line:90%
our engagement

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:44.016 align:middle line:84%
at the EarthKeeper Alliance
were effectuating a greater

00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
conservation orientation to
this very special piece of land.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.688 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I've been to that area.

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:53.492 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are original
petroglyphs on the rocks there.

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:57.196 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Are you preserving
all of that?

00:29:57.196 --> 00:29:57.963 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:29:57.963 --> 00:29:59.164 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, all of that.

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:02.635 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're in the midst
of really defining how

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:06.338 align:middle line:84%
that will look and where
it will go in the future.

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:08.908 align:middle line:84%
But the key is just
where effectuating

00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:11.176 align:middle line:84%
that change right
now and looking

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:15.748 align:middle line:84%
at what is the best outcome,
how can we create a preservation

00:30:15.748 --> 00:30:18.083 align:middle line:84%
of this property, the
restoration of some

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:21.387 align:middle line:84%
of those endangered type
of habitats that are there.

00:30:21.387 --> 00:30:24.256 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, how is that going
over with the developers,

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:27.092 align:middle line:84%
with the people who've invested
all these millions of dollars

00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:29.895 align:middle line:84%
into developing this
area or the plants?

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:32.498 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yeah, and well, I
think that's a great question

00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:40.172 align:middle line:84%
in general, because ultimately
the standard in the industry

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.341 align:middle line:84%
like all industries
have certain standards,

00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:44.877 align:middle line:84%
standard in the real
estate industry, Lisa,

00:30:44.877 --> 00:30:47.379 align:middle line:84%
is the highest best
use for a piece

00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:51.116 align:middle line:84%
of land is the maximum amount of
entitlements that you can cram

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:52.084 align:middle line:90%
on a piece of property.

00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I see.

00:30:52.785 --> 00:30:53.385 align:middle line:90%
So, how high you can go?

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:90%
How-- yes?

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.288 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: All that kind of
stuff because ultimately

00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:59.425 align:middle line:90%
that effectuates the economics.

00:30:59.425 --> 00:31:02.995 align:middle line:84%
So, interestingly our
paradigm is shifting

00:31:02.995 --> 00:31:05.397 align:middle line:84%
that to have a greater
understanding

00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:09.168 align:middle line:84%
of a new paradigm that's now
involving amongst developers.

00:31:09.168 --> 00:31:12.171 align:middle line:84%
And we're having this
conversation with developers

00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:15.074 align:middle line:84%
because obviously we can
effectuate change in everywhere

00:31:15.074 --> 00:31:17.409 align:middle line:84%
and that that's just
not feasible or possible

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:19.211 align:middle line:84%
but at least we can
have the conversation

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:22.281 align:middle line:84%
and the conversation
really is how can we look

00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:24.583 align:middle line:84%
at a new paradigm
for this industry?

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:29.321 align:middle line:84%
How can we look at balancing
the greater good of open space

00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:34.126 align:middle line:84%
of the land, of biodiversity
and have that be a creative

00:31:34.126 --> 00:31:36.628 align:middle line:84%
to value, have that
become a plus to value

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:39.498 align:middle line:84%
and really cool the
Wall Street Journal came

00:31:39.498 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
out with an article
not more than,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.337 align:middle line:84%
I think it was six weeks ago
or so, that showed a study

00:31:45.337 --> 00:31:49.775 align:middle line:84%
that when we do-- when
developers do conservation work

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:53.612 align:middle line:84%
in open space work it
actually increases the value

00:31:53.612 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
of the remaining
property by 23 percent.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:57.483 align:middle line:90%
So, that's--

00:31:57.483 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well--

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.685 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: -- that's a positive.

00:31:59.685 --> 00:32:01.687 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But if you are-- I mean I
know a particular airport that's

00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
built on the Native
American burial ground.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.061 align:middle line:84%
And so, in order to have,
you know, still show respect

00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:13.165 align:middle line:84%
for that specific area and the
bridge they built they have

00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:16.201 align:middle line:84%
Native American music playing
and pictures and so forth,

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:18.737 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't still
do justice to those

00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:21.573 align:middle line:84%
that were buried there,
that were, you know,

00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:22.908 align:middle line:90%
in that part of the land.

00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:28.714 align:middle line:84%
I mean can you ever really
justify building on those types

00:32:28.714 --> 00:32:32.918 align:middle line:84%
if there's a very, very,
very, popular resort in Hawaii

00:32:32.918 --> 00:32:36.021 align:middle line:84%
that was again built
on Native land--

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.156 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:39.024 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- that was
fought against for years,

00:32:39.024 --> 00:32:41.727 align:middle line:84%
but it's still got
put into that area.

00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So, how do you do
this right, Adam?

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.832 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, that's really a
good point, because a matter

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:50.669 align:middle line:84%
of fact in Ecuador we
have a similar situation,

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:51.937 align:middle line:90%
we were chatting a little bit

00:32:51.937 --> 00:32:54.807 align:middle line:84%
about what the president
recently release some

00:32:54.807 --> 00:33:00.612 align:middle line:84%
of the most, you know,
pristine land on the planet.

00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
The greatest biodiversity exist
in this area to oil drilling.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:10.689 align:middle line:84%
So-- and it's a very tough
call, but ultimately what I

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:13.392 align:middle line:84%
like to say and especially
with these examples

00:33:13.392 --> 00:33:18.697 align:middle line:84%
that you just mentioned is you
can't mess with what is sacred

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:22.301 align:middle line:84%
to other communities and
other tribes on this planet.

00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:25.971 align:middle line:84%
So, in these situations
in particularly

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:29.441 align:middle line:84%
that you're referencing
there should be absolutely no

00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:33.979 align:middle line:84%
development whatsoever as it
pertains to things that are--

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:37.483 align:middle line:84%
is important as burial grounds
and these other type of things.

00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:40.719 align:middle line:84%
But not withstanding
that my sense is,

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:43.055 align:middle line:84%
is if there is going
to be development.

00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:46.492 align:middle line:84%
There is that could
be extremely limited.

00:33:46.492 --> 00:33:51.096 align:middle line:84%
And the impact of the
keyword is, what is the impact

00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:52.698 align:middle line:90%
of the development overall?

00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:53.665 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:54.766 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: How many people
are coming?

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.435 align:middle line:84%
What are the trips that
are required there?

00:33:56.435 --> 00:33:58.971 align:middle line:84%
How much carbon needs
to actually go in

00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:00.572 align:middle line:90%
and to creating what is there.

00:34:00.572 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.342 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And when we
look at those type

00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:06.245 align:middle line:90%
of numbers it's pretty minimal.

00:34:06.245 --> 00:34:07.546 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be minimal.

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:10.782 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm an advocate
and I'm a minimalist.

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, you'd have to be.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.852 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fine line
and we're talking

00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:15.354 align:middle line:90%
about the Ecuador situation

00:34:15.354 --> 00:34:18.490 align:middle line:84%
where the oil drilling
could indeed create profits

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.126 align:middle line:84%
that would help reduce the
violence and the poverty levels

00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:24.296 align:middle line:84%
and these particular
regions of Ecuador.

00:34:24.296 --> 00:34:26.664 align:middle line:84%
But, yet the same time how
do you prevent that money

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:31.336 align:middle line:84%
from going to the select
few and to-- that 1 percent.

00:34:31.336 --> 00:34:33.205 align:middle line:90%
I mean how do you control it?

00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:35.673 align:middle line:84%
So, you have a big job
ahead of you here [laughs],

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:40.646 align:middle line:84%
but these are the types of
conversations that are important

00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:44.115 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to, because
without these conversations then

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:46.618 align:middle line:84%
we have situations that
we're about to take a look

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:51.557 align:middle line:84%
at for example the picture that
we have up right now or the--

00:34:51.557 --> 00:34:54.526 align:middle line:84%
is the earth basically
what I see is reacting

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:56.862 align:middle line:90%
to these types of developments.

00:34:56.862 --> 00:35:00.566 align:middle line:84%
The seismic monitor that we have
here are the amount of shifts

00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:03.235 align:middle line:84%
that are occurring in our
earth right now as we speak.

00:35:03.235 --> 00:35:04.236 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:05.304 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Tell me a
little bit about this.

00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:06.705 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, absolutely
and interestingly,

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:09.041 align:middle line:84%
one of the headlines over
the last couple of days,

00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:12.744 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought this
up is that there seems

00:35:12.744 --> 00:35:17.716 align:middle line:84%
to be earthquakes
happening in Midwest

00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:21.787 align:middle line:84%
that many feel are related
to fracking activities

00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:27.259 align:middle line:84%
which is really a process of
a very, very intense process

00:35:27.259 --> 00:35:30.562 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not here to have the
discussion right or wrong

00:35:30.562 --> 00:35:34.766 align:middle line:84%
or debate fracking but what
we are realizing in the point

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:36.869 align:middle line:84%
that you brought
up appropriately

00:35:36.869 --> 00:35:42.841 align:middle line:84%
so is our activities do effect
the earth and when we recognize

00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:45.711 align:middle line:84%
that the earth and I are
one as the Buddha did

00:35:45.711 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and the earth is my witness

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately we
should hid the advise

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.219 align:middle line:84%
that the earth is
asking us to look at,

00:35:54.219 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:84%
not that we can control it, not
that we can save this planet.

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:02.027 align:middle line:84%
That's not the point, the
point is let's make sure we're

00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:05.998 align:middle line:84%
addressing seismic activities
and other types of activities.

00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:06.999 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well I mean, take

00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:08.567 align:middle line:84%
for example the fracking
conversation.

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:11.003 align:middle line:84%
I love to have that conversation
from Ken [assumed spelling].

00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:15.607 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what-- those types
of drilling and that type

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of activity is happening
no matter what it seems.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.081 align:middle line:84%
No matter what farms, no
matter what eco systems

00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:25.417 align:middle line:84%
or culture exist in
that particular area.

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:28.220 align:middle line:90%
So, what do-- what do we do

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.422 align:middle line:84%
when we have this
types of examples here.

00:36:30.422 --> 00:36:32.224 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example

00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:36.628 align:middle line:84%
of the global sea surface
temperature increasing

00:36:36.628 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
from these types of
developments that are happening

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:90%
on pristine land and so forth.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.201 align:middle line:90%
Can we do anything about it?

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.936 align:middle line:90%
Are we headed in this direction?

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.238 align:middle line:90%
I really want to know.

00:36:46.238 --> 00:36:47.072 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Well.

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:49.341 align:middle line:90%
It is the question of our time.

00:36:49.341 --> 00:36:50.509 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:51.643 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Because the
environment is the elephant

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:53.378 align:middle line:84%
in the living room
whether we like it or not.

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.614 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And I don't know if we're
going to answer it in this hour.

00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:58.784 align:middle line:84%
But let's get some
suggestions around this though,

00:36:58.784 --> 00:37:01.586 align:middle line:84%
because that makes-- personally
makes me feel powerless

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:02.654 align:middle line:84%
when I look this
types of [inaudible],

00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:03.989 align:middle line:84%
what are we going
to look at here?

00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:07.926 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yeah, we're looking
at global catastrophe

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:11.363 align:middle line:84%
on a mass scale because it
affects our entire weather

00:37:11.363 --> 00:37:15.367 align:middle line:84%
patterns and all think what
a powerful things would come

00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:19.604 align:middle line:84%
out of this as a result of that
we sought with Sandy in New York

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.907 align:middle line:84%
or be seen in another
places around the world.

00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:24.443 align:middle line:84%
But your question and I want
to get to that and address

00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
that real quickly because
ultimately we feel as mankind

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:34.653 align:middle line:84%
as human kind that we have
the right, the entitlement

00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:37.356 align:middle line:84%
to be the conquerors
of this planet

00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:40.325 align:middle line:84%
and we're seen there
effect of that and it seems

00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:43.462 align:middle line:84%
to be even more rapid
in particular.

00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:47.399 align:middle line:84%
In China, the numbers are
very, very distressing.

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:51.403 align:middle line:84%
In India, very distressing and,
you know, it's their time now,

00:37:51.403 --> 00:37:54.339 align:middle line:84%
they believe to have material
wealth and prosperity.

00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So, the thing that we can do,
the thing that we can do each

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.479 align:middle line:90%
of us can do right now.

00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:01.646 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.482 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: No need to wait
is to really attend

00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:05.951 align:middle line:84%
to our greater own
personal ecology.

00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:09.021 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we are
attending to our lives,

00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:10.956 align:middle line:84%
how is it attending
to what-- how--

00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:14.192 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing in the
world today and ultimately

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:19.297 align:middle line:84%
as what I found, aligning
with my own personal ecology,

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:22.601 align:middle line:84%
aligning my own personal
humanity with the environment,

00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:24.269 align:middle line:90%
with mother earth, gives me--

00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:26.671 align:middle line:84%
gave me a greater
respect in honoring

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:29.241 align:middle line:90%
of this magnificent planet.

00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:33.345 align:middle line:84%
So, to effectuate that change
I believe it begins right here.

00:38:33.345 --> 00:38:36.615 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do anything until
I cleaned up my own garden

00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:90%
because I was polluting it.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.518 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What did you
do to clean that up?

00:38:39.518 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:90%
You journey as part of it.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.221 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:44.322 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But I mean have
you grown your own garden?

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:45.991 align:middle line:84%
What types of things
could you suggest to us?

00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:48.126 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, you know,
it's funny you say

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:51.063 align:middle line:84%
that because we are growing
our garden in Big Sur

00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:52.964 align:middle line:84%
but we haven't had a
chance to get into what

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:56.034 align:middle line:84%
where we are right now,
but we are very active.

00:38:56.034 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a 501C3 called urban
gardens and my wife and I--

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.943 align:middle line:84%
refer to my wife, she is
my goddess, we're partners.

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:09.347 align:middle line:84%
But we are educating
youth in inner cities.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:13.885 align:middle line:84%
So, it's about creating gardens
even if they're just small pots

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.189 align:middle line:84%
of land, whether it's in your
front yard or your back yard

00:39:17.189 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:84%
and we're working to create a
curriculum right now as we speak

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:25.864 align:middle line:84%
to help stewards that are out in
the universe out in the planet

00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:28.633 align:middle line:84%
to help them to educate
youth and educate families

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:31.303 align:middle line:84%
in communities to ensure
that we're not beholding

00:39:31.303 --> 00:39:34.739 align:middle line:84%
to the Monsantos of the
world or the corporate world

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.274 align:middle line:90%
of food and agriculture.

00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:37.108 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.343 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's a very good point.

00:39:38.343 --> 00:39:40.212 align:middle line:84%
We have some statistics
here that show

00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:44.449 align:middle line:84%
on this particular
moving picture of the--

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:48.019 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to see
in this picture here,

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:52.724 align:middle line:84%
the heading up of the polar caps
there if you could explain this

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.626 align:middle line:90%
as it goes through the years.

00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:55.961 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, so what's happening with
the rise of the last slide

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.667 align:middle line:84%
that global water
temperature those trend lines,

00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:07.472 align:middle line:84%
it is effectuating a greater
change in the upper atmosphere.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:11.943 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately as we burn
off the layers of protection

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:14.513 align:middle line:84%
that the earth has in a
most simplistic terms,

00:40:14.513 --> 00:40:16.281 align:middle line:90%
the greater rise of heat.

00:40:16.281 --> 00:40:19.251 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately,
we have an effect

00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.486 align:middle line:84%
of in the cities
basically that is going

00:40:21.486 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
on like an island effect
essentially that traps off

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.292 align:middle line:90%
of the heat that city street.

00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:30.729 align:middle line:84%
So, they trap heat
within the context

00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:34.266 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere raising
temperatures thereby--

00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.367 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Correct.

00:40:35.367 --> 00:40:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: We're seeing
these rapid ice melts.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:42.007 align:middle line:84%
Rapid, rapid ice melts around
the planet at the moment.

00:40:42.007 --> 00:40:45.777 align:middle line:84%
So, the trend line on
that is going to continue

00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
because we kind of reach the
pretty much as a tipping point

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.349 align:middle line:84%
as I pointed out in
the video earlier

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:52.918 align:middle line:90%
about 400 parts per million.

00:40:52.918 --> 00:40:55.453 align:middle line:84%
That was the point where
scientist said where carbon

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.323 align:middle line:84%
and carbon dioxide
levels at that level,

00:40:58.323 --> 00:40:59.958 align:middle line:90%
there was no turning back.

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.927 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's-- what
do we do about it?

00:41:01.927 --> 00:41:04.629 align:middle line:84%
How do we effectuate
that personal change

00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:08.433 align:middle line:84%
within our own lives so that
we can with in greater balance

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:10.969 align:middle line:84%
with earth that is
undergoing these changes.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:15.106 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, how can something
like technology help us

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:18.243 align:middle line:84%
with the increase that we see so
much in this age of technology,

00:41:18.243 --> 00:41:19.911 align:middle line:90%
can that help us or hurt us?

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:21.112 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Well good question.

00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:23.582 align:middle line:90%
Technology is not an indult.

00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:28.086 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter is,
technology has brought us a lot

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:30.689 align:middle line:84%
of the great information
that we have.

00:41:30.689 --> 00:41:31.222 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:32.057 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:41:32.057 --> 00:41:33.391 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: -- which is really neat.

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:37.495 align:middle line:84%
And-- but what technology is
showing us is it's revealing

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:41.066 align:middle line:84%
that the melting of the
polar ice caps, right--

00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:42.467 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:44.169 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: It's happening much more
dramatically than we thought.

00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.973 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: The rising of sea levels
is happening much more dramatic

00:41:47.973 --> 00:41:48.907 align:middle line:90%
than we thought.

00:41:48.907 --> 00:41:52.244 align:middle line:90%
So, it gives us a small window

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to take adjustment
and take action.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.451 align:middle line:84%
Now, is those actions being
taken by our political leaders

00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:00.919 align:middle line:84%
and governments around
the world?

00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:02.454 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:42:02.454 --> 00:42:04.689 align:middle line:84%
There's talk and there
are things happening.

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:08.293 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter, it's
insufficient, it's inadequate

00:42:08.293 --> 00:42:10.996 align:middle line:84%
and it is not enough
at this time.

00:42:10.996 --> 00:42:15.667 align:middle line:84%
So, technology is a powerful
tool but it's not an indult.

00:42:15.667 --> 00:42:18.503 align:middle line:84%
And I believe anybody
that really is sensing

00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:23.642 align:middle line:84%
that the technology can save
us is limiting their belief

00:42:23.642 --> 00:42:28.346 align:middle line:84%
in putting a lot of faith in
technology and new technology

00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:29.414 align:middle line:90%
and coming technologies.

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:30.615 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's-- it takes away

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:32.884 align:middle line:84%
from your personal
responsibility as well.

00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:35.487 align:middle line:84%
However, it does show
what we're looking at.

00:42:35.487 --> 00:42:39.157 align:middle line:84%
So, this particular side that
we're looking at next shows

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.127 align:middle line:84%
through the use of technology,
where we've come from

00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:44.162 align:middle line:84%
and potentially where
we're going.

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:47.732 align:middle line:84%
So, let's take a
look at this one.

00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:51.536 align:middle line:84%
This is the starting
back in the 1800s

00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:53.538 align:middle line:90%
of our current temperatures.

00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:57.375 align:middle line:84%
I mean the temperatures at that
time and then going forward.

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:00.045 align:middle line:84%
How does-- how do you
capture something like this?

00:43:00.045 --> 00:43:01.313 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, these
are all models.

00:43:01.313 --> 00:43:02.647 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep that in mind.

00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:07.752 align:middle line:84%
And models have limited
credibility in their own rights.

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:09.788 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to put
things in context.

00:43:09.788 --> 00:43:12.791 align:middle line:84%
But not withstanding we can
make these various assumption

00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:15.927 align:middle line:84%
and these models that
can help us to determine

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:18.663 align:middle line:90%
where we might see, for example.

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.599 align:middle line:84%
Where the sea legs
will rise a foot?

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:25.637 align:middle line:84%
Well, that'll cover in
Bangladesh, for example.

00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:27.972 align:middle line:84%
So, the neat thing
about models is

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:30.642 align:middle line:84%
that it can really show
us where we're going.

00:43:30.642 --> 00:43:33.111 align:middle line:90%
So, in some ways, the road maps.

00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:36.581 align:middle line:84%
And should we-- the
question is, are we going

00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:39.117 align:middle line:84%
to read the road signs or
we're just going to ignore them

00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:40.151 align:middle line:90%
and keep going full speed ahead.

00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:41.186 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:43:41.186 --> 00:43:42.921 align:middle line:84%
So, this is how technology
can help us.

00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:44.022 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:43:44.022 --> 00:43:45.156 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then we could
see that, you know,

00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:47.292 align:middle line:84%
the changes that have
happened over the years

00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:49.194 align:middle line:84%
and where we've come
from, where we're going.

00:43:49.194 --> 00:43:51.096 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to continue look at this

00:43:51.096 --> 00:43:53.998 align:middle line:84%
because it shows through
this projection here

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:57.335 align:middle line:84%
of how the temperatures
are increasing.

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:03.141 align:middle line:84%
How long would it take for
those-- for us to, you know,

00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%
to tip out at this range.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.811 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where is this heading?

00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:10.915 align:middle line:84%
I mean you'll see this
going into, you know, th--

00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:12.417 align:middle line:90%
what is it, the year 2100?

00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:13.818 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.687 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you'll see how the
top of the ice caps are going

00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:16.821 align:middle line:90%
to be completely melted.

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
to our environment

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.494 align:middle line:90%
if those ice caps are gone?

00:44:22.494 --> 00:44:26.131 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: We would see
massive storms on a scale

00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:27.832 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even
imagine today.

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Storms?

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.567 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Storms.

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:33.471 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately what would
occur will be things

00:44:33.471 --> 00:44:36.608 align:middle line:84%
like massive dust
falls and famine.

00:44:36.608 --> 00:44:40.245 align:middle line:84%
And much of the planet
could be covered--

00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:43.815 align:middle line:84%
much of the planet that's
habitable now could be covered

00:44:43.815 --> 00:44:48.953 align:middle line:84%
in water and certainly much of
the biodiversity would die off.

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:53.024 align:middle line:84%
And of course humanity
itself is quickly looking

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:84%
at becoming an endangered
specie themselves.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.264 align:middle line:84%
So, it's important that we're
addressing these things not

00:44:59.264 --> 00:45:02.634 align:middle line:84%
in debate about whether
something is happening or not

00:45:02.634 --> 00:45:04.702 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to
freeze over again.

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:06.471 align:middle line:90%
It's really addressing how are--

00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:10.575 align:middle line:84%
how we relate and operate
our own personal lives

00:45:10.575 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
that we engage as a community
and as a planet and as a country

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:16.114 align:middle line:90%
for example with these issues.

00:45:16.114 --> 00:45:19.484 align:middle line:84%
And do not wait to address
these type of issues, Lisa,

00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:21.886 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately
we're going to need

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:23.521 align:middle line:90%
to find a greater harmony.

00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:25.857 align:middle line:84%
The earth is just
balancing itself.

00:45:25.857 --> 00:45:27.025 align:middle line:90%
And so should we.

00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:28.059 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.928 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And heed that
this great wisdom.

00:45:29.928 --> 00:45:31.963 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And this will happen
beyond maybe our lifetime.

00:45:31.963 --> 00:45:33.364 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:45:33.364 --> 00:45:35.166 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But it will happen on our
children's children's lifetime.

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:36.568 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:38.837 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And in-- and that's what
we're doing now is what's going

00:45:38.837 --> 00:45:40.038 align:middle line:90%
to make that difference.

00:45:40.038 --> 00:45:43.141 align:middle line:84%
Are there any types of
innovations in technology

00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:46.744 align:middle line:84%
that would halt this
type of devastation

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:48.012 align:middle line:90%
that we just took a look at?

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, I-- I'm an
optimist by nature but skeptical

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.519 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
activities like this.

00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:58.756 align:middle line:84%
For example, Cantrells
[phonetic], you know,

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:03.461 align:middle line:84%
we see that extensively
big brothers decided

00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:06.631 align:middle line:84%
that this is beneficial and
this is going to help, you know,

00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:08.166 align:middle line:90%
induce greater weather patterns

00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:09.801 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
types of things.

00:46:09.801 --> 00:46:14.672 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into genetically
modifying things or tinkering,

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:18.943 align:middle line:84%
we are messing with something
that is often very troubling.

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing that in the
genetically modified [inaudible]

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.614 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:23.548 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right yes.

00:46:23.548 --> 00:46:24.516 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And primarily
in our food.

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's also another
[inaudible]

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.119 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know,

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:30.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm into sustainable
forestry for example.

00:46:30.688 --> 00:46:31.256 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:46:31.256 --> 00:46:32.357 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:46:32.357 --> 00:46:33.758 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: -- there are
aiding forest companies

00:46:33.758 --> 00:46:36.828 align:middle line:90%
that are all about GMO trees.

00:46:36.828 --> 00:46:40.331 align:middle line:84%
And so, we are starting
to tinker in ways

00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately are going

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.469 align:middle line:84%
to have some serious
effects ostensibly

00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:45.703 align:middle line:90%
for the betterment of all.

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:49.207 align:middle line:84%
But what we're finding
from GMO modified foods is

00:46:49.207 --> 00:46:51.509 align:middle line:84%
that wait a second,
some of the pest,

00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:53.378 align:middle line:90%
their back, they're stronger.

00:46:53.378 --> 00:46:54.779 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:56.848 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And so, there's all kinds
of things and I'm no scientist.

00:46:56.848 --> 00:46:59.784 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- but it's pretty
simple to say, wait a second,

00:46:59.784 --> 00:47:01.686 align:middle line:84%
is this where we
want to be tinkering?

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.656 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to tinker
with certain things then we--

00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:06.057 align:middle line:90%
then we better make certain, A,

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:10.495 align:middle line:84%
we know exactly what our end
game is and B, it should be

00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:14.599 align:middle line:84%
with the absolute transparency
in understanding of the--

00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:17.869 align:middle line:84%
of the masses and of people
that are going to be impacted

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:19.003 align:middle line:90%
by this type of things.

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:21.339 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise it's a non-starter.

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:23.341 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So what is a GMO tree?

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:27.812 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to figure that out,
what is the-- what is it do?

00:47:27.812 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: I learned this
recently because I was involved

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.721 align:middle line:84%
in a very large land
acquisition of which I was bid

00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:40.558 align:middle line:90%
out by a big timber company.

00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:43.695 align:middle line:84%
And they be-- they out bid
me by several million dollars

00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:47.598 align:middle line:84%
on a 7,000 acre parcel
in Northern California.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:51.436 align:middle line:84%
And I called them up and I
said, "I heard you got the bid.

00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:55.373 align:middle line:84%
OK. And I want to know that I'm
here that we could do something

00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:57.508 align:middle line:90%
around sustainable forestry."

00:47:57.508 --> 00:48:02.547 align:middle line:84%
And the head of the
company said to me, "Adam,

00:48:02.547 --> 00:48:06.651 align:middle line:84%
we just clear cut trees and we
are the leaders in replanting

00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:08.953 align:middle line:84%
with genetically
modified trees."

00:48:08.953 --> 00:48:10.355 align:middle line:90%
I have never heard

00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:13.558 align:middle line:84%
of a genetically
modified tree in my life.

00:48:13.558 --> 00:48:17.128 align:middle line:84%
And it's not well
known but ultimately,

00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:20.498 align:middle line:90%
it's about growing trees faster.

00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:25.436 align:middle line:84%
So, they can be reharvested not
in 80 years which is a typical--

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:26.771 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: -- life cycle of a
tree, of a forest, of a tree--

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.442 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Does it produce
the same amount of--

00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:33.678 align:middle line:84%
I mean what is it do--
growing a tree faster?

00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:36.781 align:middle line:84%
Is there a downside to
something like that?

00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, you know,
I don't have the answers

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.852 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not the scientist.

00:48:40.852 --> 00:48:41.986 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:48:41.986 --> 00:48:43.488 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: However, I don't
think they have the kind

00:48:43.488 --> 00:48:44.789 align:middle line:90%
of answers either.

00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:48.159 align:middle line:84%
Because how do we know that
the symbiosis that occurs

00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:52.463 align:middle line:84%
with trees still occurs which
is-- which creates our oxygen--

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:53.464 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:54.499 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: -- including--
how do we know

00:48:54.499 --> 00:48:56.868 align:middle line:84%
that photosynthesis
is still occurring

00:48:56.868 --> 00:48:59.270 align:middle line:90%
within these organisms?

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't know
because we tinkered with it

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.677 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know over
time how that will be.

00:49:05.677 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is pretty much a
secret type of hidden space

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.916 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of these going on.

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.017 align:middle line:90%
A lot of these stuff happening.

00:49:13.017 --> 00:49:13.951 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.686 align:middle line:84%
>>AH: Nobody knows
anything about,

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:18.356 align:middle line:84%
so I think it's time
to open our eyes--

00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:20.391 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In terms of
answers and solutions,

00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:21.859 align:middle line:90%
I mean there's forest.

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:24.595 align:middle line:84%
We don't see forest popping up
all over the place right now,

00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:26.697 align:middle line:84%
however, that's what we're
going to start to see.

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:27.699 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:49:27.699 --> 00:49:29.033 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This is probably
a new process.

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:30.568 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes, that you know what,
after lighting up the sky,

00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:34.038 align:middle line:84%
you know, healing a nice purple
color at night, you know,

00:49:34.038 --> 00:49:37.542 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to really
go, well, that looks cool

00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:39.477 align:middle line:90%
but nope, can't do that.

00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:42.313 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Neon tress-- all
right, so what are some

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:44.882 align:middle line:84%
of the other things that we
can do other than technologies

00:49:44.882 --> 00:49:46.651 align:middle line:84%
and innovations that
are happening out there

00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:47.885 align:middle line:90%
that we might not know about?

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:50.288 align:middle line:84%
What can we do, I believe
the power is always

00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:51.722 align:middle line:90%
in the hands of the people.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.691 align:middle line:84%
And if we can control what's
happening in our government,

00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:55.927 align:middle line:84%
what we can control what's
happening in our back yards

00:49:55.927 --> 00:49:56.994 align:middle line:90%
and with our communities

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:58.763 align:middle line:84%
and with our environments
that we live in.

00:49:58.763 --> 00:49:59.864 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:00.665 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, what types
of things do you do

00:50:00.665 --> 00:50:02.266 align:middle line:90%
in your living environment?

00:50:02.266 --> 00:50:05.503 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, just in level what
you said and I just ditto that,

00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:08.339 align:middle line:84%
ditto that, ditto that
because it really is

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.976 align:middle line:84%
about that effectuating
greater change is certainly

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:13.344 align:middle line:90%
political change.

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.681 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that time and time
again just hitting our heads

00:50:16.681 --> 00:50:19.484 align:middle line:84%
even the environmentalist,
even the NGO's

00:50:19.484 --> 00:50:22.787 align:middle line:84%
which are Non-government
Operations that are really all

00:50:22.787 --> 00:50:25.223 align:middle line:84%
about supporting
ostensibly good cause.

00:50:25.223 --> 00:50:27.692 align:middle line:84%
They've done great work
but the time has come

00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:30.561 align:middle line:84%
that we must take it
within upon ourselves

00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:33.231 align:middle line:84%
to effectuate this
change in our community.

00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:33.798 align:middle line:90%
In our--

00:50:33.798 --> 00:50:34.966 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: In your own garden
where there is food,

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.569 align:middle line:84%
you want vibrant food
and you want real food,

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:40.071 align:middle line:90%
you can grow that in your yard.

00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.373 align:middle line:84%
You can go down to
support your local farmer

00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:43.574 align:middle line:90%
and your local community.

00:50:43.574 --> 00:50:45.877 align:middle line:84%
These are the people that
are really creating a

00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:46.944 align:middle line:90%
greater vibrancy.

00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:48.946 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
the health of it.

00:50:48.946 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the vitality
in the regenerative nature

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.918 align:middle line:90%
of connecting with earth.

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:57.622 align:middle line:84%
So, we're finding getting
people in connecting them

00:50:57.622 --> 00:51:00.057 align:middle line:84%
with the earth, creating
a greater awareness

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.392 align:middle line:90%
around the earth is--

00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:04.862 align:middle line:84%
is an essential factor and
then I keep coming back to it.

00:51:04.862 --> 00:51:08.232 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately really
are we doing our own work

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:11.469 align:middle line:84%
and are we saving ourselves
in finding a greater truth

00:51:11.469 --> 00:51:14.272 align:middle line:84%
of our greater connectivity
to the oneness of it all

00:51:14.272 --> 00:51:15.239 align:middle line:90%
and the fun of it all.

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:16.474 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Are we doing
the inner work?

00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:17.308 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:18.376 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Is what you mean by that?

00:51:18.376 --> 00:51:20.444 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I also believe
that it's important

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:24.148 align:middle line:84%
to educate our children
and to bring them back

00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:27.451 align:middle line:84%
to the beautiful
concepts around nature.

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.554 align:middle line:84%
And as you said,
nature is attempting

00:51:29.554 --> 00:51:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to balance itself right now
through what we're seeing

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:37.261 align:middle line:84%
with our-- our global
temperature rise.

00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:40.131 align:middle line:84%
But bringing back
education of nature back

00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:43.367 align:middle line:84%
into the environments because
there is definitely information

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:44.802 align:middle line:90%
about technology

00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:46.938 align:middle line:84%
in our educational
environments right now.

00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:48.172 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:49.874 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But not so much
about bringing nature back.

00:51:49.874 --> 00:51:52.076 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that you
have a friend whose pictures

00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:53.177 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to show here.

00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:54.612 align:middle line:84%
And there's many,
many more of these.

00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:55.813 align:middle line:90%
But what was his name?

00:51:55.813 --> 00:51:56.847 align:middle line:90%
Lawrence [assumed spelling]?

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:57.415 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: No, Laurent
[assumed spelling].

00:51:57.415 --> 00:51:58.216 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Laurent?

00:51:58.216 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes, beautiful name.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:00.718 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And Laurent --
what was his last name?

00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Well, he's
not-- was not a friend

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.357 align:middle line:84%
but he is somebody I came
across in this magnificent world

00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:09.093 align:middle line:90%
of internet and whatnot.

00:52:09.093 --> 00:52:11.796 align:middle line:90%
And these are indelible shots

00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:17.401 align:middle line:84%
and this dear man was killed
recently a few years back ago.

00:52:17.401 --> 00:52:20.104 align:middle line:84%
I don't know all
these circumstances

00:52:20.104 --> 00:52:22.139 align:middle line:90%
of it was in South America.

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:26.244 align:middle line:84%
And whether and how we was on
assignment or whatever it was.

00:52:26.244 --> 00:52:30.481 align:middle line:84%
And just to honor him and his
great work and the magnificent

00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:33.084 align:middle line:84%
of those that really care
about our greater ecology

00:52:33.084 --> 00:52:34.418 align:middle line:90%
in connecting us to the truth

00:52:34.418 --> 00:52:36.354 align:middle line:84%
of who we really are
and he really did.

00:52:36.354 --> 00:52:37.421 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:52:37.421 --> 00:52:38.789 align:middle line:84%
So, Laurent Shuavel
[assumed spelling].

00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:39.857 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Shuavel, that's right.

00:52:39.857 --> 00:52:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Is his name
and there's some of --

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:45.062 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think if this is really
an important thing to so is

00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:46.998 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at these
photos are really take

00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:49.834 align:middle line:90%
in what nature is to us.

00:52:49.834 --> 00:52:51.569 align:middle line:84%
And more of these are
available on line.

00:52:51.569 --> 00:52:53.237 align:middle line:84%
But this is a beautiful
picture, I don't know

00:52:53.237 --> 00:52:54.338 align:middle line:90%
if this is wife or not.

00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:56.874 align:middle line:90%
But he was a photo journalist.

00:52:56.874 --> 00:53:00.344 align:middle line:84%
This is some of the CKs and
some of the beautiful things

00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:04.115 align:middle line:84%
that nature designs just to
see-- that with a great angle.

00:53:04.115 --> 00:53:08.519 align:middle line:84%
His talent was-- was these
photos and the perspectives

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:11.322 align:middle line:84%
that he pulls us into
with his particular type

00:53:11.322 --> 00:53:14.925 align:middle line:84%
of photo journalism which I
think is absolutely beautiful.

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:17.828 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where this is.

00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:21.198 align:middle line:84%
This is another beautiful
thing of God's paint brush,

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:84%
she's taking from the same paint
brushes building this designing

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.572 align:middle line:84%
this gorgeous flowers
and the same

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:31.175 align:middle line:90%
as the shell around an animal.

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:34.679 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful part
of our ecosystem.

00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:36.747 align:middle line:90%
I jut picked a few of these out.

00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:38.316 align:middle line:84%
Here's our beautiful
pollinators.

00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:42.086 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes, it looks like
a good meal there going on.

00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:46.857 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I know and it's going
to take that to the next place

00:53:46.857 --> 00:53:49.427 align:middle line:84%
in [inaudible], I mean the
bee population is something

00:53:49.427 --> 00:53:52.263 align:middle line:90%
that we have got to address.

00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- you can-- there's
a lot of great organizations

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:59.303 align:middle line:84%
that teach you how to grown
your own bees in the backyard.

00:53:59.303 --> 00:54:00.938 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes, become
your own bee keeper.

00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:02.139 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Backyard bee keepers?

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:05.276 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes, but we must
attend to bee pollination,

00:54:05.276 --> 00:54:08.212 align:middle line:84%
the dye off a bees and our
pollinators on this planet

00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:11.716 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately no bees,
no pollinators, no food.

00:54:11.716 --> 00:54:13.117 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, absolutely.

00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's a great picture

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.289 align:middle line:84%
because we were look could
ever see that with a naked eye.

00:54:18.289 --> 00:54:19.657 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:19.657 --> 00:54:22.093 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you must have had
some type of microscopic lens

00:54:22.093 --> 00:54:23.894 align:middle line:84%
in his camera but to be
able to really see that

00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:25.963 align:middle line:84%
and to capture that
is a gift to us.

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:26.998 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:54:26.998 --> 00:54:28.632 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And a piece
of education as well

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:33.204 align:middle line:84%
to show how our bees really
do pollinate our food supply

00:54:33.204 --> 00:54:37.007 align:middle line:84%
and not just sting,
most people would think.

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:42.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a great picture that
I show because it reminds me

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.882 align:middle line:90%
of what we are approaching.

00:54:44.882 --> 00:54:48.552 align:middle line:84%
Is it feels like we're just and
ant to a giant bowl of water.

00:54:48.552 --> 00:54:49.387 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yeah.

00:54:49.387 --> 00:54:50.988 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is so massive to us.

00:54:50.988 --> 00:54:54.058 align:middle line:84%
But yet this little
ant can still push this

00:54:54.058 --> 00:54:55.726 align:middle line:84%
and we can still
make this happen.

00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:57.061 align:middle line:90%
We can still make it work.

00:54:57.061 --> 00:54:58.262 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: We-- we can do it.

00:54:58.262 --> 00:54:59.096 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yup.

00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:00.498 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: We definitely can do it.

00:55:00.498 --> 00:55:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that we can handle
five or 10 times our body weight

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.635 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that
we're approaching.

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Or more.

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.505 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This is what-- I'
chose this picture just

00:55:07.505 --> 00:55:09.006 align:middle line:84%
because it's what
we're looking at it.

00:55:09.006 --> 00:55:11.142 align:middle line:84%
The tip of the iceberg they
we're looking at right now.

00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:15.079 align:middle line:84%
What an incredible-- how do
you get a picture like this?

00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:18.482 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Just-- just
totally still and it looks

00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:21.018 align:middle line:84%
like we can still
move this titanic

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:22.553 align:middle line:90%
that maybe heading towards this.

00:55:22.553 --> 00:55:23.788 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, free standing.

00:55:23.788 --> 00:55:24.755 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes, indeed.

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:25.723 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:26.857 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one that I loved

00:55:26.857 --> 00:55:29.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's the ants
building a bridge.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.363 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way that they--
they work in their community.

00:55:32.363 --> 00:55:34.432 align:middle line:84%
So, they build bridges
between lands,

00:55:34.432 --> 00:55:38.169 align:middle line:84%
the environments something that
you don't think is possible

00:55:38.169 --> 00:55:41.338 align:middle line:84%
to do, you can actually do
through the power of people.

00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:44.375 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, you know,
answer a wonderful example

00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:47.778 align:middle line:84%
of that because they-- they
not only move 10 times their

00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:49.146 align:middle line:90%
body weight.

00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:52.516 align:middle line:84%
But they build bridges and they
can move entire communities.

00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:55.586 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: And-- and we
can build a bridge

00:55:55.586 --> 00:55:57.822 align:middle line:84%
between our outer
and inner world.

00:55:57.822 --> 00:55:58.823 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: This is true.

00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:00.825 align:middle line:84%
And also a bridge
to-- to see what--

00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:05.729 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing is quite often
walking between the two worlds

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:09.733 align:middle line:84%
of major development
and conservation

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:11.602 align:middle line:84%
and preservation
at the same time.

00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.972 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you are constantly
walking on that bridge.

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:17.541 align:middle line:84%
So, that's a good
kind of analogy

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:19.543 align:middle line:90%
of what you're doing as well.

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:22.546 align:middle line:90%
This is-- this is great.

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:23.981 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: You got to love that one.

00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:27.718 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yes, because
it's-- it's faith.

00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:31.188 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Please send down the
nut, I'll take it, anything.

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Please protect
our environment.

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:33.858 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Let me back in.

00:56:33.858 --> 00:56:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yes, but this
is what our--

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:42.299 align:middle line:84%
our entire culture is built
on is faith, it's on that--

00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:45.669 align:middle line:84%
just looking up to the
gods and saying help us

00:56:45.669 --> 00:56:47.605 align:middle line:90%
and deliver what we need.

00:56:47.605 --> 00:56:51.709 align:middle line:84%
And help us find the
solutions here and create peace

00:56:51.709 --> 00:56:55.312 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and whatever it
is that we can create, so.

00:56:55.312 --> 00:56:56.714 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Yes.

00:56:56.714 --> 00:56:57.681 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, I think that you're
a peace maker on this planet,

00:56:57.681 --> 00:56:59.049 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so much
for joining me--

00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:00.417 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Thank you for having me.

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:02.586 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- in this hour and all
that you're doing good luck.

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.488 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Thank you
very much, Lisa,

00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:06.257 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate being
here with all of you.

00:57:06.257 --> 00:57:07.658 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:57:07.658 --> 00:57:09.093 align:middle line:84%
And then there's ways that we
can support you as well by going

00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:12.062 align:middle line:84%
to the website, it's the
EarthKeeper Alliance website?

00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:14.465 align:middle line:84%
>> AH: Yes you can, feel
free to check it out.

00:57:14.465 --> 00:57:15.399 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:15.399 --> 00:57:16.634 align:middle line:90%
>> AH: Absolutely.

00:57:16.634 --> 00:57:19.003 align:middle line:84%
