>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa
Garr, host of Gaiam Inspiration.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.458 align:middle line:84%
And my guest message
today is very simple.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.759 align:middle line:90%
Kenji Kumara is my guest.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.464 align:middle line:84%
And he says be the state
you want the world to be.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.633 align:middle line:90%
Live by the golden rule.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.103 align:middle line:84%
Be the clear and perfect
channel that you are.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:40.274 align:middle line:84%
Trust, forgive, allow
and receive.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:44.345 align:middle line:84%
And the best spiritual
medicine is hugs, smiles,

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:46.747 align:middle line:90%
laughter and spontaneity.

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:84%
Kenji serves as a universal
quantum bridger and a channel

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.386 align:middle line:90%
for ascended energies.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.156 align:middle line:84%
And he says his work will
help bridge the worlds

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:84%
between the ascended
masters and us, the humans.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.295 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, welcome to the show.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Kenji Kumara: Thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:04.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh,
it's my pleasure.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.301 align:middle line:84%
So you're an amazing
spiritual teacher,

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.537 align:middle line:84%
and I've had the
wonderful opportunity to sit

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:11.272 align:middle line:90%
with you for a while now.

00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:13.974 align:middle line:84%
But tell me how it was
when you first got started,

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you discovered
these gifts,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.214 align:middle line:84%
or have you always
lived these gifts?

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Kenji Kumara: No,
I think like with all

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:26.854 align:middle line:84%
of us we know we can,
what, can do certain things

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:90%
or we have certain perceptions.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.327 align:middle line:84%
And myself like pretty
much everyone else shut

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.497 align:middle line:90%
down probably by 7 or 6.

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.532 align:middle line:90%
My case probably by 5.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:39.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Why was
that, I mean do you know?

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.335 align:middle line:90%
It happens to a lot of us.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Kenji Kumara: Yes.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.704 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had indications
from the other side,

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.674 align:middle line:84%
certain archangels communicate
these messages to me.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:54.415 align:middle line:84%
I was really open
when I was 2, 3 and 4.

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and contemplated,
okay, so if I went back

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:02.389 align:middle line:84%
to that age what was I
really feeling towards

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.227 align:middle line:84%
like staying open or not staying
open regarding my family?

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.629 align:middle line:90%
I had wonderful parents,

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.633 align:middle line:84%
but throughout their lives
they didn't see who I was.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.236 align:middle line:84%
And that's very common
as you know, right?

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.471 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Our parents don't
really see us for who we are,

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.006 align:middle line:90%
and they always see us at 16.

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.476 align:middle line:84%
My dad until the day he died
in his 80s saw me at 16, right?

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.477 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:24.945 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: I mean he
couldn't get me past 16.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.114 align:middle line:84%
He saw me at age 16
always messing up

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.883 align:middle line:90%
and never amounting to anything.

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:30.684 align:middle line:90%
But I think I foresaw this.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.921 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of projected,
okay, if I stay this open

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.356 align:middle line:84%
like what's going
to happen to me?

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.024 align:middle line:84%
What are they going
to think about me?

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:42.296 align:middle line:84%
And I felt they would
have not understood

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:45.065 align:middle line:90%
so I turned down the light.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.067 align:middle line:90%
But I was still a rebel

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:50.137 align:middle line:84%
and I was still -- I
could never fit in.

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:52.273 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to but I was
kind of one of those kids.

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:54.308 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Were you rebelling
against yourself,

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:57.144 align:middle line:84%
against the entities,
against the system?

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.079 align:middle line:84%
I mean what was the
rebelhood coming from?

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.214 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It was the
system in general.

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.349 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it at an early age.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.054 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the compression
if you will and that sense

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:10.257 align:middle line:84%
of can't you just
stay in this box.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.592 align:middle line:90%
Don't be too outrageous.

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:15.029 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you to crack
up the class in fourth grade

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
because then the
teacher will get upset.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.598 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.267 align:middle line:84%
I always got to go
in the corner.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:24.171 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, yeah because you
would see things and say things

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that people couldn't
understand, right?

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.241 align:middle line:90%
I mean knowing you.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.842 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: I was funny.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.878 align:middle line:90%
I was actually funny then.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:31.979 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You still are.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.148 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And the class
would crack up.

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:37.918 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
was being funny about.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:41.088 align:middle line:84%
And she would get really upset
or he would get really upset.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.957 align:middle line:84%
I never got spanked but
I'd go to the corner.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:90%
Don't make waves, Kenji.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:45.959 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.094 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.562 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now when you
rediscovered that energy

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.467 align:middle line:84%
and you reowned it in yourself
what was that experience like?

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.969 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: That was actually not
until, believe it or not,

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.939 align:middle line:84%
07 when I went on the road
to start teaching [inaudible]

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.607 align:middle line:90%
that I shared with you.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:05.245 align:middle line:84%
I left my last teacher, like
okay, I've got to share this.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.514 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So you were going to
spiritual path and learning

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:90%
from various teachers.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.451 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah, for 40 years.

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.186 align:middle line:90%
That was my thing, right?

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:15.288 align:middle line:84%
I was the seeker, I
was a very good seeker

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.156 align:middle line:90%
with not all the money.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.558 align:middle line:90%
I was the poor seeker.

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:18.392 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: The poor seeker, yes.

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Reading all the books, going

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
to all the seminars,
absorbing it all.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.963 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:26.567 align:middle line:84%
And going -- and most of
it didn't work for me.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It was only a small
percentage that worked for me

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.307 align:middle line:84%
out of all the stuff that I
studied, all the teachers.

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:37.845 align:middle line:84%
I kept a little bit, and now
I've really not kept anything.

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:84%
It's like whatever
was uniquely mine

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.817 align:middle line:84%
from how they taught me
that's like in the field

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:45.017 align:middle line:90%
that people experience.

00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.989 align:middle line:84%
And then share with the audience
the story you told me yesterday

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:52.092 align:middle line:84%
about the one guy that called
you and kind of started you

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.961 align:middle line:90%
on your teaching path.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.597 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, so I make a
decision, right, okay I'm going

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:90%
to attempt to teach this.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.604 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew it was
teachable but I didn't know how.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.006 align:middle line:84%
So we did one small
training in Seattle,

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.475 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I got my
assistant, Anda [phonetic].

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:12.746 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a call from
somebody that was checking

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:16.049 align:middle line:84%
out the website where
I had studied before.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.119 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he got my
phone number, I think it was

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:23.323 align:middle line:84%
on the blog part of the
site but he calls me.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.061 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, I'm
no longer there.

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
But if you're interested in
like what I do I can come

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle line:90%
and teach you.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.035 align:middle line:84%
I can do some sessions
with your friends.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:40.707 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything about
going on the road, right,

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.242 align:middle line:84%
because I've never
done it, right.

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a sponsor, I
don't have a business plan.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.979 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have anything but me.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.381 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.383 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know about this
other stuff that you're supposed

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:51.151 align:middle line:90%
to have to be successful.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.054 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I'll get my
ticket Southwest

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:56.256 align:middle line:90%
and we go over there, right.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:06:00.694 align:middle line:84%
So we went and people got
really excited about the work.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.463 align:middle line:90%
He got really excited.

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.731 align:middle line:84%
And then I was going
to come again.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well, how many do
you have to make it worthwhile?

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.804 align:middle line:84%
And he goes I only
have four signed up.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.707 align:middle line:84%
I said I need at least
ten just for sessions.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.809 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing some
little intros, right.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.011 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Taos.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:21.448 align:middle line:84%
So very kind of artsy,
creative place but very poor.

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:84%
I mean not a lot
of money, right.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.952 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.987 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And I was
going to cancel.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:30.858 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm not going to fly
out there for just four people.

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.459 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, you've got to come.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.361 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want
to come for that.

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.864 align:middle line:84%
That's like not going
to make it worthwhile.

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.131 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have
anything else going

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.068 align:middle line:84%
on so I thought,
okay, I'll do it.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:44.071 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
good that I did it,

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.039 align:middle line:84%
that he like tried
to convince me.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.709 align:middle line:84%
Because that made Santa
Fe eventually at the end

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.378 align:middle line:84%
of the year, and that's
how I really got started.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:90%
Taos fell apart after that.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.916 align:middle line:84%
It was good, and then
it fell off the map.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:84%
And then Santa Fe came, and
that was the start of my getting

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.257 align:middle line:84%
out there traveling
without a business plan.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.658 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I mean that's okay

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:08.161 align:middle line:84%
because what it is is it's your
gifts that are coming through.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Your gifts as a healer come
from what type of energies?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.837 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier about
the ascended master's energy.

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:21.475 align:middle line:84%
Where do you receive
your greatest insights?

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.177 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Okay, so imagine this.

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:25.812 align:middle line:84%
So imagine we've got
this huge sun, right,

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.982 align:middle line:84%
and everything revolves
around the sun like we know

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:32.786 align:middle line:84%
or think we know, right,
astronomically speaking, okay?

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:36.189 align:middle line:84%
So we tap into the
power of the sun.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.793 align:middle line:84%
Actually there's a sun behind
the physical sun, and it's known

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:43.397 align:middle line:84%
in esoteric literature
thousands and millions of years,

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:45.165 align:middle line:84%
so we call it the
great central sun.

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I help
people to tap into.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.604 align:middle line:84%
That's what I tap
into, that source.

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:55.242 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the essential
energy for creation

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.877 align:middle line:90%
and so why not use that?

00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:84%
And from that is
unconditional love,

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.882 align:middle line:84%
and that's the most powerful
energy that we can use

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:04.017 align:middle line:84%
on this planet so
that's what we tap into.

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.752 align:middle line:84%
And we show others
how to do that.

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:09.222 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And do you also
work with guidance?

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.726 align:middle line:84%
Do you receive guidance
throughout your sessions?

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.762 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it, though, is
like not conscious so it

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:17.364 align:middle line:90%
like comes from my voice.

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:21.201 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, there's like
the angelic realms come

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.537 align:middle line:90%
through my voice.

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And some people may
actually see that level.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.374 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:28.275 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: But most people don't.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
But they feel touched by it.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.678 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not claiming
anything other

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.881 align:middle line:84%
than we can show
people how to --

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:39.519 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that word channel,
but how to be like a messenger

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.388 align:middle line:84%
for the other realms
to this realm.

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:46.326 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel my job
[inaudible] we'll be a little

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.528 align:middle line:90%
conductor bridger guy, right?

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.765 align:middle line:84%
So we'll help people
understand about archangels

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:54.368 align:middle line:84%
and how they are
part of evolution.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.104 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, they're mentioned
somewhat in the Bible

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.206 align:middle line:90%
but not correctly really.

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:02.676 align:middle line:84%
And they're there so
we need to use them.

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:06.847 align:middle line:84%
We're in a chaotic state
right now astrologically.

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:08.649 align:middle line:90%
We're in a chaotic node.

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:12.919 align:middle line:84%
Everything is upset on purpose,
everything is falling apart.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.022 align:middle line:84%
We're about ready to
go war again or --

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.523 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: How long is
this going to last?

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I've noticed this.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:19.026 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Probably a
few more years.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.728 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's not like --
it's like, oh, really?

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.699 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're just beginning
the cleansing of the earth.

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:28.001 align:middle line:90%
You think it's been bad?

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:30.671 align:middle line:84%
No, it's going to
get more intense.

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
prepared with the quantum

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.242 align:middle line:84%
or we're not going
to make it literally.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.412 align:middle line:84%
Beings are going to go I'm
checking out, I'm checking out.

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:42.049 align:middle line:84%
I can't take this energy,
I can feel it, the chaos.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.052 align:middle line:84%
I understand what you're saying,
and I've had so many people say

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.087 align:middle line:84%
that same thing and
really validate the fact

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.322 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to get worse.

00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:50.657 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had a
challenge with that message

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:53.827 align:middle line:84%
because I'm here to bring
inspiration to people.

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.563 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about
today are the tools on how

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:58.865 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
chaos as it ensues.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:03.236 align:middle line:84%
And as we can hear that
alarming sound within us.

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:08.909 align:middle line:84%
So the question you used
earlier it's really alarming.

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:13.213 align:middle line:84%
Is the quantum light work,
what is quantum light work?

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:16.183 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Just a name I gave
to my practice, my business.

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But actually we're going to
brand me, me, Kenji Kumara.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.155 align:middle line:84%
But actually quantum light
weaving was something

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:26.893 align:middle line:84%
that I asked, okay, universe
so I'm going to do this work.

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:29.529 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to brand me,
I want to brand the work.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:33.767 align:middle line:84%
But I realize it's
different now.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.703 align:middle line:84%
People say you should
brand yourself.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:41.575 align:middle line:84%
So the work I gave it a name
just because to give it a name

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:44.878 align:middle line:84%
so as not to make it
so kind of nebulous.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:50.016 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted quantum in there
because we are understanding

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.019 align:middle line:84%
about quantum theory,
quantum concepts

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.155 align:middle line:90%
which are very relevant.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So let's talk
about the quantum --

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.592 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the
quantum light weaving

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.928 align:middle line:84%
because it gives the best name
to what it is that you do.

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:84%
Because the light weaving is
from what I saw grids that occur

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:12.706 align:middle line:84%
and geometric shapes that
occur in a quantum field.

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.709 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So talk about
what that is.

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:16.877 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: So think about
it this way.

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:19.646 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so if you're a
light weaver as opposed

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:24.518 align:middle line:84%
to a light worker, quantum
light weaver, light weavers,

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.754 align:middle line:84%
light weavers connote
something playful and light

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:32.726 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to work
really hard like workers.

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:90%
So imagine that we do this.

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:40.667 align:middle line:84%
We as conscious beings we weave
ourselves through the universe,

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.403 align:middle line:84%
and we touch places of
what we consider darkness

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:46.573 align:middle line:90%
or chaos or conflict.

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.809 align:middle line:84%
And if those parts
are open then, yeah,

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:52.345 align:middle line:84%
you can see the shift
right there.

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:55.816 align:middle line:84%
You can see them shift
out of compression to --

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:56.716 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Expansion.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:57.818 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: -- an openness, right?

00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You're like, oh,
that feels so good.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.656 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: There's a great
way of explaining this

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
or actually experiencing
this yourself right now.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.794 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at these
slides that Kenji sent.

00:12:07.794 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:84%
And these certain photos here
are meant to illicit that type

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.368 align:middle line:90%
of expansion in your mind.

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:18.371 align:middle line:84%
And some of these are
slides that you found --

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.139 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: On the internet.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: -- on the internet.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.209 align:middle line:84%
But why did you choose
these specific slides?

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:23.543 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: I got guidance.

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Okay, go do a Google search
on photos, spiritual photos,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.849 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] photos,
quantum photos.

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:31.751 align:middle line:84%
And so my search
brought me from different

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:84%
like aspects of life
[inaudible].

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:35.288 align:middle line:84%
Okay, that's going to
stimulate your brain to do that.

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.523 align:middle line:84%
That's going to stimulate
the brain to do that, yeah.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:41.428 align:middle line:84%
So it's all -- in that
moment it was like, okay,

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:42.562 align:middle line:90%
stimulating the brain.

00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:46.233 align:middle line:84%
Use these photos in your
PowerPoint presentation,

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.134 align:middle line:90%
in the intensives.

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.402 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:51.938 align:middle line:84%
And so the one that specifically
spoke to me was the one

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.707 align:middle line:84%
with the mountain and
the cloud over it.

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.009 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, it just did.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.177 align:middle line:90%
Here's a couple more.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:58.912 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at these.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:02.616 align:middle line:84%
Look at what inspires you,
what moves you, what opens you,

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.652 align:middle line:84%
what makes you feel
this expansiveness

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:08.221 align:middle line:84%
that Kenji Kumara
is talking about.

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:11.591 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a
certain resonance,

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.826 align:middle line:90%
it could be any one of these.

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.962 align:middle line:84%
But this is a great way
to experience this work.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:19.366 align:middle line:84%
And as you're looking at
these photos there's a certain

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:20.567 align:middle line:90%
energy transmission.

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.768 align:middle line:90%
It's called an activation

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:25.472 align:middle line:84%
that Kenji also emanates
while we're talking today.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.374 align:middle line:84%
And so explain a
little bit about that

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:30.911 align:middle line:84%
and what people could
experience from that.

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:32.245 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Or are experiencing now?

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:34.981 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Put in present
tense, yes.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.182 align:middle line:90%
Okay, think about it this way.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.652 align:middle line:90%
Your voice has power.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:42.622 align:middle line:84%
So from today forward you're
really going to be conscious

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:45.892 align:middle line:90%
that your affects matter.

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:46.826 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.696 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: People, situations,
events.

00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But your voice is an
extension of the presence

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.669 align:middle line:90%
of your soul, not your mind.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:14:00.941 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand that, and
then when we breathe and connect

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:06.313 align:middle line:84%
to a grid, if you will, a matrix
that is designed for people

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:10.517 align:middle line:84%
that when you say, okay, now
tap into this or allow yourself

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to feel this that they're
actually energetically

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.693 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum way going to feel
the effects of the presence

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.395 align:middle line:84%
of your soul moving
through your voice,

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:84%
moving through the TV
channels, the video-audio

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:32.238 align:middle line:84%
and affecting change
in a new way now

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:35.542 align:middle line:84%
because we're more
conscious of how energy works.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.545 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power of
technology, your show.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.146 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yes, yes,
that's beautiful.

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.615 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It can be a
very powerful medium.

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.852 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It is an energy
transmission these shows.

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.321 align:middle line:84%
My intention is for
them to be that.

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:49.622 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:52.025 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And I love that we're
aligned on that frequency

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.061 align:middle line:84%
because you have come in
with a certain intentionality

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.764 align:middle line:84%
and frequency as well
that will last forever.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.466 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter when
this show is watched.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:00.934 align:middle line:90%
It continues on.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:03.703 align:middle line:84%
That's what quantum light
weaving is, is that right?

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.105 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: That's good, yes.

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:07.874 align:middle line:90%
So I ask the universe --

00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:09.776 align:middle line:84%
well, here's what I
got over the years.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:11.478 align:middle line:90%
We call them downloads.

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.947 align:middle line:84%
So I would get these
impressions, ah,

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.648 align:middle line:84%
these insights, right,
the ah ha's.

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.484 align:middle line:90%
I would get them.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:18.785 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy
for me to get them

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
because I'm staying
open up here, right?

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:26.393 align:middle line:84%
So, boop. And they say,
okay, these activations --

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:29.662 align:middle line:84%
well, actually it was a radio
show listener said, Kenji,

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:32.032 align:middle line:90%
are your activations evergreen?

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:34.234 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Do they last forever?

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:35.902 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And you know I
never heard that phrase.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That term.

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.104 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And I went,
well, of course.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.508 align:middle line:84%
Actually he was asking me
a question that helped me

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:44.677 align:middle line:84%
to clarify to explain
about these occupations.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:48.548 align:middle line:84%
So from that point forward,
yeah, we say it's slide, organic

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:52.352 align:middle line:84%
and evergreen which means
no matter where you are

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:55.555 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, no matter
what time you listen to it,

00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.691 align:middle line:84%
live or replay, it's
like live for you there.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.326 align:middle line:90%
And it grows with you.

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.962 align:middle line:90%
It's not just some static thing.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.799 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at life like that
that everything is evergreen,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.501 align:middle line:84%
nothing is static,
that the matrix

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:13.006 align:middle line:84%
of your TV show is a
live, breathing organism

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.241 align:middle line:90%
if you will on the quantum.

00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And when your listeners
go, okay, I want to listen

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.746 align:middle line:84%
to Lisa's, I want to
watch Lisa's show today --

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: -- but with the intention
I'm going to tap into the matrix

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.853 align:middle line:84%
of this show and
essence of Lisa,

00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:28.488 align:middle line:84%
it's a different
experience for them.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.356 align:middle line:84%
It will be a way
different experience.

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.058 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have a few more pictures
that I want you to look at,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.729 align:middle line:84%
and just explore this
as this energy is coming

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:39.499 align:middle line:84%
through with what
Kenji is communicating.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.301 align:middle line:84%
And as the pictures
are appearing

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.838 align:middle line:84%
on your screen just take a
look and see what moves you,

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
what inspires you,
what opens you,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.477 align:middle line:90%
what makes you feel lighter.

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
What is that open source
of communication for you

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:56.916 align:middle line:90%
as we're going through this.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:01.454 align:middle line:84%
And this is in essence what
quantum light weaving is.

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:04.924 align:middle line:84%
Certain ones of these pictures
you will have had an experience

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:10.096 align:middle line:84%
there or it lights up a certain
frequency in some way for you.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.831 align:middle line:90%
And these are beautiful photos.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:16.402 align:middle line:84%
They're I'm sure all designed
to do different things, yeah.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:17.403 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.605 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of neat
to have that kind

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:21.307 align:middle line:84%
of visual experience while
you're watching a show.

00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:23.576 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, part
of like art therapy.

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:27.947 align:middle line:84%
Part of my professional
training was art therapy.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.049 align:middle line:90%
That was my master's thesis.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.052 align:middle line:84%
And I try to use
it over the years.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a great example,
I haven't thought of this,

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.891 align:middle line:84%
but this is like, yeah,
okay, another introduction

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:42.862 align:middle line:84%
for the audience about how
you can use art as a catalyst.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:43.997 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:17:43.997 --> 00:17:45.498 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It can be very
healing and catalyzing.

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:47.734 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Absolutely, to
experience a healing

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.669 align:middle line:90%
by even just looking at photos.

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.839 align:middle line:84%
So that's what quantum
light weaving is in essence.

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:54.841 align:middle line:90%
And you also say that it's --

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:58.811 align:middle line:84%
well, you say that art and
practice of soul transformation.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So you also said that
it comes in waves.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Why waves?

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.452 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, you live by
the beach here, right?

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:09.722 align:middle line:84%
You've got the waves
going, right?

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:15.628 align:middle line:84%
It's really like that in my
sensing on a quantum level.

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:20.233 align:middle line:84%
Think of it this way, so
the sun emanates vibrations,

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.936 align:middle line:90%
right, continually to us.

00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:84%
You can consider them waves,
waves of light and sound.

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And they're warm, yes.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.514 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yes, that are
emitted constantly

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:36.082 align:middle line:90%
at a supersonic speed.

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:40.286 align:middle line:84%
We don't feel it unless
we tap into that level.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.288 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And anyone can tap
into this no matter what,

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.356 align:middle line:90%
no matter where they are?

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, everybody
is tapped into it,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.458 align:middle line:84%
but if you consciously
receive it

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.294 align:middle line:84%
in meditation it has
a different power now.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It has the answers
to your prayers.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.233 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: A different power
as opposed to before?

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.368 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, not
being aware of this.

00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Just being unconscious
of it, right.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.305 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I'm just going
and breathe some fresh air,

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
right, get some sunshine.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.342 align:middle line:90%
Okay, that's one level.

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:06.012 align:middle line:84%
But go into medication and
actually receive the essence

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:08.615 align:middle line:84%
of who you are coming
through the sun.

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.217 align:middle line:84%
It's a different ball
game then, right?

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.418 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And then if you
bring it into here, okay,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.022 align:middle line:84%
we're going to breathe
it and receive it here,

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:18.524 align:middle line:84%
and then the brain is going
to download when I need it

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:22.896 align:middle line:84%
in my life, when crises comes up
we're going to get the download

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:28.868 align:middle line:84%
for the resolution
shall we say to that.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:30.637 align:middle line:90%
We have to know how.

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.273 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, and so now
how can we use this energy

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:39.212 align:middle line:84%
to help heal loved ones or
ourselves or issues, situations?

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:40.947 align:middle line:90%
How do we use this?

00:19:40.947 --> 00:19:43.216 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: So everybody
now can do this, right?

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine and feel
a current situation of one

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.858 align:middle line:84%
of your family members in a
bit of a pickle or a crisis

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:56.262 align:middle line:84%
or a point of choice, a
choice point, a big one.

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:57.964 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Or themselves, right,
they can also use that.

00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.565 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Or themselves,
yes, a choice point.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:05.104 align:middle line:84%
Could be with health, money,
job, money, relations.

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.906 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything, right?

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:08.808 align:middle line:84%
And so all we need
to do now is receive.

00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:12.712 align:middle line:84%
So we all know how to breathe,
so if we just breathe in now

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.347 align:middle line:90%
and just receive it here

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and then let it trickle
down to here.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, let your heart do the rest.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.923 align:middle line:84%
Your mind goes off to
Hawaii on a vacation.

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:24.857 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:26.759 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Don't have
to know, right?

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:28.428 align:middle line:90%
Don't have to know.

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:29.429 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Huh.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.297 align:middle line:84%
So you can't mentally
figure it out?

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:34.067 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Oh, no, you can't
or you get in trouble.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.268 align:middle line:90%
You'll get headaches.

00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:36.069 align:middle line:90%
You'll get headaches, right?

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.637 align:middle line:90%
And then you'll, well,

00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:39.472 align:middle line:84%
can I trust this
impression that I just got?

00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:42.375 align:middle line:84%
You'll go back and
forth yes and no, right?

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So I mentioned
earlier that one

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.479 align:middle line:84%
of your simple rules
is the golden rule.

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:47.847 align:middle line:90%
What is the golden rule?

00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:48.881 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: You know that one.

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:49.849 align:middle line:90%
We all know.

00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
We all grew up with
that one, right?

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Treat everybody how you
would like to be treated.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.054 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:20:55.054 --> 00:20:56.389 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: So if you
want to be treated

00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.358 align:middle line:84%
with kindness then you show
kindness with other people.

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You don't be mean to them.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.363 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so trust and
belief was also another one

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:04.497 align:middle line:90%
that you talked about.

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:06.799 align:middle line:84%
So in this process that
you're experiencing now

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
or you're talking about now
where the mind chatter gets

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.138 align:middle line:84%
out of the way, you allow
yourself to receive and connect

00:21:12.138 --> 00:21:14.407 align:middle line:90%
to that source energy and trust

00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:18.277 align:middle line:84%
that process, trust
that process.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: We have to or
we're not going to make it

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.616 align:middle line:84%
through this chaotic
note, this chaos here.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.017 align:middle line:90%
You're going to leave your body.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to check out and
go, okay, I'll come back again.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.121 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.188 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Seriously, you know.

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:31.657 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So you've listed
some of the topics

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.227 align:middle line:84%
that we just talked about,
what is quantum light weaving.

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:90%
And in this slide here we talk

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:39.799 align:middle line:84%
about as we said earlier
it's the latest advance

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:43.236 align:middle line:84%
of complementary
energy medicine.

00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:47.507 align:middle line:84%
It's an approach, it's not
a technique or a process.

00:21:47.507 --> 00:21:48.608 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Approach, yes.

00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's an approach.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to a one, two, three
step process it's an approach.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.615 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yes, there's
a difference.

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:57.383 align:middle line:84%
I learned that from Dr. Trager
[phonetic] and Trager work

00:21:57.383 --> 00:21:59.285 align:middle line:90%
which I loved for 20 years.

00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:90%
And I learned about approach.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:05.925 align:middle line:84%
So it's like what's
your approach to life?

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.428 align:middle line:84%
You don't use a technique in
your approach to life, right?

00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:09.262 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, in life, right.

00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:10.029 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: So the same thing.

00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.997 align:middle line:90%
This is an approach.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.698 align:middle line:84%
How do you approach
the universe.

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:15.501 align:middle line:84%
I suppose your approach
to holding,

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:18.471 align:middle line:84%
and that's not quite
even accurate, holding,

00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:84%
it's really sharing
the vibration

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:23.042 align:middle line:90%
of knowing your perfection

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:28.014 align:middle line:84%
in this now moment
can shift incredibly.

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:31.517 align:middle line:84%
Anything and everything
if everything is

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:34.754 align:middle line:90%
in full receiving mode.

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:37.223 align:middle line:84%
Partial is even okay,
ten percent is okay,

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:40.059 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] is okay, 90
percent is really great.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.261 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now also you
talked about the quantum.

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:44.964 align:middle line:84%
So in this quantum field is that
what you mean when you say --

00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:46.299 align:middle line:84%
you refer to the
quantum all the time.

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.135 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In the quantum
field you said

00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:84%
that you see the body
as already healed.

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:55.675 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: If someone comes
to me and goes, Kenji,

00:22:55.675 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I've got diabetes,
like I've got cancer

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.614 align:middle line:90%
and I got high blood pressure

00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:07.653 align:middle line:84%
and I think I'm getting
Alzheimer's and all that, right?

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:12.492 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so the old model as good
as it was when it was developed,

00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.861 align:middle line:84%
right, we're going
to treat all of this.

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:16.229 align:middle line:84%
And then the higher
level is, okay,

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.731 align:middle line:84%
we're going to treat all this
in relationship to the soul.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
even go beyond that.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.136 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
why even look at that,

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:24.604 align:middle line:90%
why even look at that story?

00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:25.438 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:26.372 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Why don't we stay focused

00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:29.242 align:middle line:84%
on where we really
are all the time

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.878 align:middle line:90%
which is that perfected state.

00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:34.614 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean perfection
in perfect,

00:23:34.614 --> 00:23:40.586 align:middle line:84%
it means that perfected state of
you knowing exactly everything

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:44.023 align:middle line:84%
in where your life is and where
it's going and being in a state

00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:46.092 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have
to do a lot.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.827 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, yes, yes.

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:48.928 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: No, really.

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:53.366 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going
to learn that the art

00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:57.403 align:middle line:84%
of being can actually
manifest without doing.

00:23:57.403 --> 00:23:59.739 align:middle line:84%
See, doing is the old
model again, right?

00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:02.041 align:middle line:84%
You're doing, doing,
doing, doing,

00:24:02.041 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
doing and you've
got this schedule.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:09.348 align:middle line:84%
And mom's have this schedule
and guys have this schedule.

00:24:09.348 --> 00:24:10.583 align:middle line:90%
It's the old model.

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:13.819 align:middle line:84%
The challenge of new
earth it's a challenge.

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:20.226 align:middle line:84%
It's, alright, so how do we
express and manifest our purpose

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:22.361 align:middle line:84%
from a place of our
soul and our knowing --

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:23.629 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: -- still having
an ego to enjoy life

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:31.637 align:middle line:84%
by balancing your checkbook
and that kind of stuff

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:35.775 align:middle line:84%
without getting in the way,
right, and creating health

00:24:35.775 --> 00:24:37.743 align:middle line:90%
and well being in every aspect?

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:39.078 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:42.048 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so much how,
it's just that we have to go,

00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:43.883 align:middle line:90%
okay, I'm going to receive.

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:45.851 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to practice
the art of receiving

00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:47.253 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life here.

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:48.054 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ah, wow.

00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:48.955 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: The art of receiving.

00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:50.323 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:53.159 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: That's what initially
meditation was for initially.

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:55.561 align:middle line:84%
It got distorted just
like everything else.

00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Yoga got distorted,
everything got --

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.432 align:middle line:84%
spiritual healing got
distorted, everything.

00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:02.001 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We are marketed
towards convenience.

00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:05.471 align:middle line:84%
We are marketed towards the
convenience, the fast step,

00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:09.575 align:middle line:84%
the get it now type of
convenience technology.

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:11.777 align:middle line:90%
It's where our world is going.

00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:15.915 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking about
here is being in the allowance

00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:21.053 align:middle line:84%
of receiving is not
a fast, quick fix.

00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:24.824 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, it can be in those
moments that a person is ready

00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:27.593 align:middle line:84%
for really the manifestation
of a quick fix.

00:25:27.593 --> 00:25:30.763 align:middle line:84%
If they've done their homework
and there's not a lot of stuff

00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:33.966 align:middle line:84%
in their emotional body and
their intellect is disengaged,

00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:37.903 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can actually begin
to create miracles on the spot.

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.772 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's no
reason why you can't.

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:44.076 align:middle line:84%
Like illness today and wake
up tomorrow and go, God,

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:47.046 align:middle line:90%
I feel great, what illness?

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:47.947 align:middle line:90%
Did I have an illness?

00:25:47.947 --> 00:25:48.981 align:middle line:90%
Did I have cancer.

00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:49.915 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's interesting
because --

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.018 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: You might
even go to that place

00:25:52.018 --> 00:25:53.252 align:middle line:84%
where you go what are
they talking about?

00:25:53.252 --> 00:25:55.321 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You can have a
total spontaneous healing

00:25:55.321 --> 00:25:56.856 align:middle line:90%
in this space.

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:58.157 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah.

00:25:58.157 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, it's interesting,
though, how the mind tries

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to keep you hooked to the story,
to wake up the next morning

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.167 align:middle line:84%
and actually have the
permission not to feel sick.

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:84%
Whereas your mind every
morning was waiting for the pain

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:84%
to surface and knowing
the things you can't do

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:13.839 align:middle line:90%
when the pain is there.

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:15.041 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:16.876 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And all the things
and systems you've lined

00:26:16.876 --> 00:26:20.446 align:middle line:84%
up around you to take
care of the pain.

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:23.416 align:middle line:84%
And the stories that you've set
up for yourselves and others

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.317 align:middle line:84%
that you can't do
because of the pain.

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:28.954 align:middle line:84%
And it really does -- you set
your life up around the pain.

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:31.557 align:middle line:84%
And to wake up in the
morning and say, okay,

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:33.225 align:middle line:84%
I have total permission
for this pain to be gone,

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:36.629 align:middle line:84%
but your life is set up for the
pain, it's very interesting.

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:39.732 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes an
adjustment mentally

00:26:39.732 --> 00:26:43.369 align:middle line:90%
that that is going to happen.

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:46.005 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: More emotionally
actually I believe, yeah.

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:46.806 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:48.674 align:middle line:90%
So I want to tell a story.

00:26:48.674 --> 00:26:51.377 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call this
the jambalaya story, okay?

00:26:51.377 --> 00:26:53.045 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Okay.

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:55.448 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] We're going to
create the infamous jambalaya

00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:56.682 align:middle line:90%
story here.

00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:59.185 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We're going to
create the jambalaya story.

00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:01.821 align:middle line:84%
So Kenji has a favorite
restaurant.

00:27:01.821 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:84%
And he loves the
jambalaya at the restaurant.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
And it's simmered for three
hours with beautiful spices,

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really
wonderful recipe

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.166 align:middle line:84%
that this restaurant makes,
but they took it off the menu.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, Kenji, you
called the restaurant.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
You've got to tell the
story because I'm kind

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.406 align:middle line:90%
of recreating it for you.

00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:24.043 align:middle line:84%
And you said -- tell the story,
can I have the jambalaya?

00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:27.012 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, I said last time I
was here we're going to be here

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.281 align:middle line:84%
in two months, three months,
both of us, and we're going

00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:31.517 align:middle line:84%
to come here because you
said you're probably going

00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:33.819 align:middle line:84%
to put the jambalaya back on
the menu so I won't call you.

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:35.554 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm thinking,
right, but I'm saying, okay,

00:27:35.554 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see you in a
few months and we're going

00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:39.125 align:middle line:90%
to have jambalaya, right?

00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:41.093 align:middle line:84%
I get their names
and everything.

00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know I had a thought
of, well, I could call them

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.534 align:middle line:84%
and verify if they're going
to have the jambalaya,

00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:55.574 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go there anyway
with you and my office manager.

00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:58.577 align:middle line:84%
So I assumed that it
was going to be there

00:27:58.577 --> 00:28:01.781 align:middle line:90%
and so why bother them to call?

00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:03.482 align:middle line:90%
But at the last moment we call.

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:05.951 align:middle line:84%
And they said they didn't
have it, they're not going

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:07.186 align:middle line:90%
to put it back on the menu.

00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:11.123 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, wow, they really
didn't get much request.

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:12.191 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?

00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:15.361 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
make the sauce anyway.

00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:16.929 align:middle line:84%
The guy kind of guaranteed
me, well,

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:18.764 align:middle line:84%
when you come back again
we'll make it again for you.

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:90%
And luckily he was there.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:23.469 align:middle line:84%
The chef was there and
the waiter was there

00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:25.471 align:middle line:90%
that did us last time.

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:28.073 align:middle line:84%
And so we got the
people to get them,

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
know me, right.

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:33.045 align:middle line:84%
Talked to [inaudible]
and there and --

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But they said
we're not going

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.382 align:middle line:84%
to make the jambalaya
for you, right, yeah?

00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:37.216 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Uh-huh.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not on the menu,

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.585 align:middle line:84%
why do we want to
make it for you?

00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:40.653 align:middle line:90%
We don't now you.

00:28:40.653 --> 00:28:42.021 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You said the
best thing to them.

00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:43.389 align:middle line:90%
You said -- what did you say?

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:46.792 align:middle line:84%
You said, well, I've
already tasted it

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:48.027 align:middle line:90%
so now you have to make it.

00:28:48.027 --> 00:28:49.829 align:middle line:90%
You went forward to the fact

00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:52.131 align:middle line:84%
that you had already eaten
the jambalaya this time

00:28:52.131 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:90%
around which I loved.

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:57.636 align:middle line:84%
So you took them into the
quantum and said, well,

00:28:57.636 --> 00:28:59.672 align:middle line:84%
I've already eaten it
and it's really great.

00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:00.606 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: It was.

00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:01.207 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So now you
have to make it.

00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:01.707 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:02.775 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:29:02.775 --> 00:29:05.444 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It was really
funny in the moment

00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:07.279 align:middle line:84%
because you're not talking
about a past experience.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:10.082 align:middle line:84%
You were saying this time
here now I've already eaten it

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:11.483 align:middle line:90%
in your restaurant.

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.486 align:middle line:84%
So you've already made it but
you don't really know that yet.

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:19.859 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yes, because you agreed
to it two months ago, right?

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So they made it.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.595 align:middle line:84%
I loved it because you
kind of took them forward

00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum of you
already enjoying it.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.733 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned this so
many times of acting as if,

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
praying as if, law of
attraction, all of those words

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.905 align:middle line:90%
that we use around it.

00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
But you have a word for
it called the quantum.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.344 align:middle line:84%
And you went into the quantum of
the experience of the enjoying

00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:41.013 align:middle line:84%
of eating the jambalaya
with friends.

00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:43.115 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
had them do the work,

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.451 align:middle line:84%
go backwards, reverse
engineer it.

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:46.485 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:48.587 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And make the
actual jambalaya,

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:50.556 align:middle line:90%
take three hours to do it.

00:29:50.556 --> 00:29:52.992 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else ordered it that
night because that's okay.

00:29:52.992 --> 00:29:55.194 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter because
you had that intention.

00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:57.563 align:middle line:84%
So is this how you
look at someone

00:29:57.563 --> 00:29:59.899 align:middle line:84%
when you approach them
at a healing level?

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:02.501 align:middle line:84%
Do you look at them and say
your healing is already --

00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:05.404 align:middle line:84%
you're already a whole
person, you're already full,

00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:07.306 align:middle line:90%
you're already healed?

00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:09.375 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Like if you
came for a session

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:12.111 align:middle line:84%
and you said I've got this
going on, this going on

00:30:12.111 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I'd like
to create in my life, right,

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.415 align:middle line:84%
well I'm going to
go to the place

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:18.117 align:middle line:90%
of where you naturally are.

00:30:18.117 --> 00:30:22.888 align:middle line:84%
So that place doesn't have any
scars or wounds or compressions.

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have any of that.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:30.229 align:middle line:84%
So I choose to see you as you
are in your body as you are,

00:30:30.229 --> 00:30:32.498 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
share with you.

00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.466 align:middle line:84%
You could say I'm holding
that state for you.

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:36.068 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
the wait experience

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:38.103 align:middle line:84%
and you fall backwards
onto the mat and all

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:42.141 align:middle line:84%
that that's what you're
aligning up with automatically.

00:30:42.141 --> 00:30:43.709 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to guide you.

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.911 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to say, okay, we're
going to muscle test your arm

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:47.112 align:middle line:90%
to see that you got it.

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to do
any of that stuff, right?

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.952 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume
you're getting it.

00:30:52.952 --> 00:30:56.789 align:middle line:84%
So when I say that it means
actually they are getting it

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:59.191 align:middle line:84%
because I'm knowing
that they're getting it.

00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:02.361 align:middle line:84%
Nob maybe I hope you're
going to get it, right?

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.997 align:middle line:90%
Like we felt it.

00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:10.469 align:middle line:84%
You were getting what you were
asking for and it's continual.

00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:13.439 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you're going
to get the whole pie today.

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:15.874 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get little
pieces fed to you each

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.577 align:middle line:84%
and every day that are going to
be a different flavor every day.

00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:19.378 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, interesting.

00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:20.646 align:middle line:90%
So the healing continues on.

00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:22.414 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It always
does until complete.

00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:25.084 align:middle line:84%
So that's the new thing
that we've calibrated

00:31:25.084 --> 00:31:29.855 align:middle line:84%
into everything now until
complete as you can allow.

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:31.523 align:middle line:90%
That's what Jesus did actually.

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:32.691 align:middle line:90%
You know what he did?

00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:37.763 align:middle line:84%
So when he gave his
blessings to us back then,

00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:41.166 align:middle line:84%
folks remember this, you
were back there then, right,

00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:44.636 align:middle line:84%
he said because I remember this
because when I tuned in I went,

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.938 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, he said that.

00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:49.975 align:middle line:84%
He says what I give to you
I give for all eternity.

00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:52.878 align:middle line:84%
So the blessing he gave even if
was only one time and you fell

00:31:52.878 --> 00:31:57.549 align:middle line:84%
over and somebody caught on the
stony ground, you remember that,

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:00.252 align:middle line:90%
stones, he gave forever.

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:02.988 align:middle line:84%
See? So he said, hey,
okay here it is from God

00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:04.823 align:middle line:84%
and take your whole
lifetime to get this

00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:07.092 align:middle line:90%
because it's all here for you.

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:09.161 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to come and
get another one from me.

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:10.529 align:middle line:90%
You got it all here.

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:12.164 align:middle line:90%
See, isn't that cool?

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we are
understanding today.

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:18.537 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you said
as you will allow.

00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:19.805 align:middle line:90%
That's an important piece.

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:21.707 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: As you will allow
because some people will go, no,

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, it's
like too much.

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:25.978 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you set your
life up for pain, yes, yes.

00:32:25.978 --> 00:32:28.747 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Or it's like I
can't understand that,

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:29.782 align:middle line:90%
that's like what?

00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:32.518 align:middle line:84%
That's not what [inaudible]
told me?

00:32:32.518 --> 00:32:33.852 align:middle line:90%
What? My mind.

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:37.389 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a headache now,
I better go for my aspirin.

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's okay, the
mind will freak out.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.096 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if the light's
really bright it can get

00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:46.065 align:middle line:90%
like a wave in it.

00:32:46.065 --> 00:32:47.299 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's uncomfortable.

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:48.634 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Uncomfortable, yeah.

00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not bad, it's just better
go drink some water now.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Probably just grounding,
I'll come back and sit

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.042 align:middle line:90%
with this and see, yeah.

00:32:57.042 --> 00:33:01.513 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now when
you set that healing

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:06.485 align:middle line:84%
until complete have you had
people complete their healing

00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:09.421 align:middle line:84%
and come back to you and say
this illness is completely gone

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:13.392 align:middle line:84%
or I can do this, before
I was never able to do it.

00:33:13.392 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen the restoration?

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.694 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah.

00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:16.895 align:middle line:90%
Here's the funny thing.

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:19.398 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I don't
know until I ask them,

00:33:19.398 --> 00:33:21.400 align:middle line:90%
well, how's that thing?

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.734 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And they forgot.

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:25.204 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: They go it's great!

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:27.372 align:middle line:90%
I don't even feel it.

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:31.009 align:middle line:84%
But if I had to ask them they
wouldn't [inaudible] to tell me.

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.977 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:33:31.977 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's great,
that is amazing.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.215 align:middle line:90%
Alright, so we were talking

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:39.218 align:middle line:84%
about furthermore,
about the quantum --

00:33:39.218 --> 00:33:44.089 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And furthermore is really
moving forward, furthermore.

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Furthermore
is moving forward.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:49.128 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was actually going
to ask you about trauma

00:33:49.128 --> 00:33:52.598 align:middle line:90%
that occurred in past lives.

00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Which show up in
early childhood by the way.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.302 align:middle line:84%
That's mirrored in their
childhood and in birthing.

00:33:57.302 --> 00:33:59.938 align:middle line:90%
Okay, all that's from before.

00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:04.543 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So when you see somebody
who has an illness do you look

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:05.978 align:middle line:90%
to see how many lifetimes

00:34:05.978 --> 00:34:08.147 align:middle line:84%
that illness has
occurred or generations?

00:34:08.147 --> 00:34:08.847 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: No.

00:34:08.847 --> 00:34:10.115 align:middle line:90%
We look at it like this.

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:11.249 align:middle line:84%
We understand that everything
is from the past anyway

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:14.620 align:middle line:84%
so everything is a
reflection of past lives.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.022 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Nothing's ever new.

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:19.124 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you got a
new thing in this lifetime

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:19.858 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to work through it.

00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:22.461 align:middle line:90%
No, it's all old stuff.

00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:24.963 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What would you
say your old stuff was?

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: With my dad on the
level of not being affected

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.207 align:middle line:84%
by his not understanding
who I was.

00:34:35.207 --> 00:34:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And not being affected by,
well Kenji, you can't do that.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.479 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do this and this.

00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Look, you went to college

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and now you're not
using your degree.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.149 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get a job.

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:47.853 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to be, you
know, I was just trying to be

00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:50.555 align:middle line:90%
who I am like we all do.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:55.227 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't argue with him.

00:34:55.227 --> 00:34:59.364 align:middle line:84%
I felt that his mind could not
grasp a conversation that I had

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:03.101 align:middle line:84%
with him to try to explain
where I'm coming from.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.872 align:middle line:84%
But he believed up until the
day he died I was a failure,

00:35:06.872 --> 00:35:07.906 align:middle line:90%
a failure.

00:35:07.906 --> 00:35:10.642 align:middle line:84%
His number one son
failed in his life.

00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:13.912 align:middle line:84%
But now he comes to the
intensives from the other side

00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:16.748 align:middle line:90%
with mom and they go, oh.

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:17.616 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's interesting.

00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:19.251 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: He's actually succeeding.

00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
He's not like a bum
like we thought.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.555 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my God, we owe
him an apology.

00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:26.625 align:middle line:84%
Your parents will come to
you, and they will look at you

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:29.428 align:middle line:84%
from the other side which
is very different and see.

00:35:29.428 --> 00:35:30.762 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Many people will look

00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:33.332 align:middle line:84%
at that experience a their
father calling them a failure

00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:34.867 align:middle line:90%
and never let it go.

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:35.867 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yeah.

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.403 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And it manifests
into disease.

00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:42.174 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Always remember dad or
mom said that and like, God,

00:35:42.174 --> 00:35:46.144 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't say back
because I was a kid.

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I was a kid, right?

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.284 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't defend myself and
go, no, that's not right.

00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:54.786 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But you let go
of that and you did

00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:57.389 align:middle line:84%
that through the
quantum light weaving?

00:35:57.389 --> 00:35:59.391 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, I realized
they were showing

00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:01.393 align:middle line:90%
up in these intensives

00:36:01.393 --> 00:36:07.332 align:middle line:84%
and watching their son do
magic I guess to be playful.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:11.336 align:middle line:84%
So my knowing that they're
seeing me now in the true light,

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:12.638 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I don't have
to do anything.

00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:16.341 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like it's all
healed up because they see

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.777 align:middle line:84%
who their former son
is and what he's doing.

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:20.245 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, interesting.

00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:23.949 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of going past into
past trauma and past life trauma

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:26.952 align:middle line:84%
and everything comes from the
past you said in order to heal

00:36:26.952 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:90%
into the future, right?

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.389 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, you could say
everything is a reflection

00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:31.223 align:middle line:90%
from before.

00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:90%
And so really we just need to --

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.362 align:middle line:84%
we don't really need
to work from before.

00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:40.232 align:middle line:90%
We just need to -- I guess

00:36:40.232 --> 00:36:44.469 align:middle line:84%
to put it really simply
we just need to receive.

00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:45.971 align:middle line:84%
We just need to keep
receiving, right?

00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:48.206 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You said that,
yes, absolutely.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.075 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Okay, so give
me the answers

00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:51.877 align:middle line:90%
or show me the way out of this.

00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.413 align:middle line:84%
This is what you ask
the universe, God.

00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:58.183 align:middle line:84%
But not in the old
model, you know?

00:36:58.183 --> 00:37:02.287 align:middle line:90%
Not in the old model of prayer.

00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:05.424 align:middle line:84%
See, we just have to get a --
okay, here's the main thing.

00:37:05.424 --> 00:37:09.528 align:middle line:84%
Here's where I believe the key
to freedom for the planet is.

00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:12.397 align:middle line:84%
I haven't said this
on TV or radio yet.

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.266 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time so
than you, alright?

00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:15.534 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:37:15.534 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: So this is for
everybody that's in a religion.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.371 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:20.505 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Or came from a religion

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.708 align:middle line:84%
which pretty much
everybody, right?

00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:26.244 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt, and I'm
going to stick by this

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.413 align:middle line:90%
and see, and see what happens.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:32.184 align:middle line:84%
So here's where the
compression comes from.

00:37:32.184 --> 00:37:37.022 align:middle line:84%
Here's where your sense
of feeling is suppressed

00:37:37.022 --> 00:37:41.093 align:middle line:84%
and your wanting to
be free comes from.

00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:84%
It comes from accepting on some
level that you were born in sin

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and that you have to
do a certain thing

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.701 align:middle line:90%
in order to be saved.

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:53.839 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do that you're
going to go to purgatory or hell

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:56.575 align:middle line:84%
when you die and
there's only one life.

00:37:56.575 --> 00:37:58.844 align:middle line:84%
That's where that
compression comes from.

00:37:58.844 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fall from
the Garden of Eden.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.016 align:middle line:90%
So therefore everybody is

00:38:04.016 --> 00:38:06.952 align:middle line:84%
in [inaudible] after
this one being.

00:38:06.952 --> 00:38:09.955 align:middle line:90%
Think of it worldwide.

00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Accepting that on some level,
and you see in the world.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.595 align:middle line:90%
Just look at the news.

00:38:16.595 --> 00:38:19.164 align:middle line:84%
You see the effects
of that thinking.

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:19.731 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:20.265 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: You do.

00:38:20.265 --> 00:38:21.099 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:24.102 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: If we can free ourselves

00:38:24.102 --> 00:38:28.073 align:middle line:84%
from that this would be
a new earth very quickly,

00:38:28.073 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.041 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, it would.

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: We're going to
have the new earth one way

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.846 align:middle line:84%
or another whether it's here
or actually if it's a new earth

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:39.117 align:middle line:84%
on the 5th to 8th dimensional
level which is being created.

00:38:39.117 --> 00:38:39.885 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:41.286 align:middle line:90%
Being created in what way?

00:38:41.286 --> 00:38:43.622 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Being created physically
on the 5th to 8th dimensions.

00:38:43.622 --> 00:38:46.091 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be able
to live on that earth

00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:48.627 align:middle line:84%
if this earth does not
respond to the call soon.

00:38:48.627 --> 00:38:50.462 align:middle line:90%
We will have an opportunity

00:38:50.462 --> 00:38:53.932 align:middle line:84%
to teleport there while
we're still in this lifetime.

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:56.501 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Explain.

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.702 align:middle line:90%
That's a tough one to explain.

00:38:57.702 --> 00:39:00.172 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Because the original plan

00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:02.974 align:middle line:84%
of this earth becoming
paradise it got off course

00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:07.946 align:middle line:84%
because the beings that
controlled this earth

00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:10.215 align:middle line:84%
for too long they're not
giving up their power.

00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:12.317 align:middle line:84%
So they're still
playing their game.

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:17.322 align:middle line:84%
Alright. So the earth cannot
respond as a collective body

00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:20.692 align:middle line:84%
in the way that we were
destined to years ago.

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:21.793 align:middle line:90%
We're way behind schedule.

00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:23.895 align:middle line:90%
I felt that.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.464 align:middle line:90%
We're off course and way behind.

00:39:25.464 --> 00:39:27.332 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We see the
reports, absolutely.

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.801 align:middle line:84%
We just did a show
about environmentalism

00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:31.069 align:middle line:90%
and where we're headed, yes.

00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:33.605 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: But here's where I
think it really occurred,

00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I feel that no
one -- I don't need to prove it,

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:44.316 align:middle line:84%
but I feel our country who
was the leader in the 60s

00:39:44.316 --> 00:39:49.321 align:middle line:84%
of the world, because three
people got assassinated changed

00:39:49.321 --> 00:39:53.492 align:middle line:84%
the course of evolution
for this planet.

00:39:53.492 --> 00:39:56.261 align:middle line:84%
It regressed and went
kind of sideways.

00:39:56.261 --> 00:40:00.499 align:middle line:84%
We weren't supposed
to be in the place

00:40:00.499 --> 00:40:03.668 align:middle line:84%
that we are now had
certain events not occurred.

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:04.803 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Not occurred, right.

00:40:04.803 --> 00:40:06.271 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: But for whatever
reason it was allowed.

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:07.272 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: They did.

00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:09.407 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And they took
out our leaders.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:13.278 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine they took out
our leaders of the free world

00:40:13.278 --> 00:40:16.414 align:middle line:84%
because they knew the truth and
were going to tell the public

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
through the press and
they were taken out.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.685 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to worry,
guys, because they're not going

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:90%
to take us out anymore.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.323 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Because there's too
many of us that know the truth.

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:26.558 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: There's too many of us

00:40:26.558 --> 00:40:27.759 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
the budget for it.

00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.628 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean, right?

00:40:29.628 --> 00:40:30.662 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:32.531 align:middle line:84%
So then to create
on a quantum level,

00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:33.698 align:middle line:90%
though, how do you do that?

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:36.201 align:middle line:84%
How do you get to that
5th to 8th dimension?

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:38.069 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: All you have to do
is keep receiving again.

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:39.571 align:middle line:90%
You just keep receiving --

00:40:39.571 --> 00:40:40.939 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What does it feel like?

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: -- your next step.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.243 align:middle line:84%
You now how it shows up as
less worry in your life.

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:48.113 align:middle line:84%
You're still going
to have challenges,

00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:50.815 align:middle line:90%
but less worry, less stress.

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:53.718 align:middle line:84%
See, my change has been
on a business level.

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:55.887 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you could
say I worry but nowhere

00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:59.658 align:middle line:84%
like I did before I went
quantum, nowhere like before.

00:40:59.658 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:90%
My mom said you're a worry wart.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.661 align:middle line:84%
I used to worry when
I was a kid.

00:41:02.661 --> 00:41:05.096 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I used
to worry as a kid.

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:06.932 align:middle line:90%
You're a worry wart.

00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:08.166 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:09.401 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I think I know what that is.

00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.969 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But you say you
don't worry on the quantum.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.137 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to drill into this

00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.738 align:middle line:84%
because I'm really
curious about it.

00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:14.573 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: We don't.

00:41:14.573 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Nobody worries in the quantum.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.742 align:middle line:84%
That's that place
of peace, right?

00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:19.311 align:middle line:90%
You feel that eternal peace.

00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:22.213 align:middle line:84%
That's the quantum, that's
the bliss, that's the joy.

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:26.751 align:middle line:84%
That's what all the masters
talked about, that Samadhi place

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:29.321 align:middle line:84%
that the Zen masters
talk about, Samadhi.

00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:33.558 align:middle line:84%
That's the release from
the compression, Samadhi.

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:35.293 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I understand what
you're talking about.

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:37.462 align:middle line:90%
And the question that comes

00:41:37.462 --> 00:41:40.865 align:middle line:84%
up in my mind is how do you get
anything done in that space?

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:45.303 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Oh, we have to learn,
we have to learn to navigate

00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:47.339 align:middle line:84%
in the body on a
physical with that.

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:49.007 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little spacey.

00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:50.542 align:middle line:90%
It's a little spacey.

00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:52.177 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But it hasn't
been created yet.

00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:55.981 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, we haven't
collectively grounded it enough.

00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:58.883 align:middle line:84%
So it's like when enough people
do a certain thing it gets more

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:03.455 align:middle line:84%
easier for the rest of us,
right, the [inaudible] thing.

00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:06.124 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I do is I share --

00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:08.293 align:middle line:84%
okay, we have to
ground this quantum.

00:42:08.293 --> 00:42:11.396 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep it up
there and be spacey.

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:13.398 align:middle line:90%
We have to embody it.

00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says, okay, now here's
the way to embody this,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.903 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't quite get
it back then, right?

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:20.271 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:23.041 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was interpreted so
many different ways that it went

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:24.709 align:middle line:84%
into -- and this
could be as well.

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.413 align:middle line:84%
I mean grounding of quantum
no one has a reference

00:42:28.413 --> 00:42:29.848 align:middle line:90%
for what that means.

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:31.916 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: That's true,
and that's very good.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.652 align:middle line:90%
We have to create our own.

00:42:33.652 --> 00:42:36.788 align:middle line:84%
We have to calibrate our
own reference for this.

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:39.224 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's fun.

00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not like rigid like,
okay, it has to be like this,

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.094 align:middle line:90%
it's in the manual here.

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But I do at the
same time want to know how.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.765 align:middle line:90%
I understand what --

00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:47.966 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: No, you don't
have to know how.

00:42:47.966 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:90%
You just keep receiving.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.136 align:middle line:90%
Okay, I'm going to embody.

00:42:51.136 --> 00:42:53.338 align:middle line:84%
Every day I'm going to
embody more of who I am.

00:42:53.338 --> 00:42:54.439 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's great.

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: You don't have to know.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.843 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: No, it's great because
I'm here to ask the questions

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:00.178 align:middle line:90%
that everyone else is asking.

00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:02.814 align:middle line:84%
I get on a certain level with
what you're talking about.

00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:09.054 align:middle line:84%
I experience it, I feel it, but
you can't put words to it yet.

00:43:09.054 --> 00:43:10.188 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: No, no.

00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:11.456 align:middle line:90%
You just have to live it.

00:43:11.456 --> 00:43:13.124 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You have to
experience it.

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:14.325 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: You'll just
be more blissed out.

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:16.094 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the main, yeah.

00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:17.729 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So as you're
allowing people to go

00:43:17.729 --> 00:43:20.832 align:middle line:84%
through this activation
that you take people through

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:27.172 align:middle line:84%
and they lose their
body muscle structure,

00:43:27.172 --> 00:43:29.374 align:middle line:84%
is that why people
fall and go --

00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:31.076 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: No, the brain
goes offline.

00:43:31.076 --> 00:43:32.277 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to mention that.

00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:35.413 align:middle line:84%
The brain goes -- you
know when you go offline,

00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:84%
not sleep mode or
like log off --

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.985 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Deep meditation.

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:43.221 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: You put it on
either hibernate or sleep?

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:45.523 align:middle line:84%
So it's like your computer
goes offline, right?

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:46.691 align:middle line:90%
But it's still active.

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:48.493 align:middle line:84%
There's just nothing
showing up on the screen.

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:51.296 align:middle line:84%
So your brain goes
offline, boop, like that.

00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:56.701 align:middle line:84%
Right when the quantum
interfaces all this it goes, oh,

00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:59.904 align:middle line:90%
too much, offline, go hibernate.

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:02.006 align:middle line:84%
And then your body
goes either backwards

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:04.209 align:middle line:90%
or forwards or sideways.

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:08.313 align:middle line:84%
So that it can go into this
still place for you to receive.

00:44:08.313 --> 00:44:11.082 align:middle line:84%
See, when the mind or
brain is offline that's

00:44:11.082 --> 00:44:13.084 align:middle line:84%
when it's really
good to receive.

00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:15.587 align:middle line:84%
Chipmunks going you
can't receive, right?

00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:16.988 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ooh!

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:18.156 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And when you
lay down you lay

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:20.892 align:middle line:84%
in a very open position
which is --

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:21.893 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: And you can't move.

00:44:21.893 --> 00:44:24.362 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- vulnerable,
right, right.

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:25.697 align:middle line:90%
So why is that?

00:44:25.697 --> 00:44:29.267 align:middle line:84%
Why the open vulnerable position
that you can't move from?

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:30.301 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: That's what
your body does

00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:32.403 align:middle line:84%
when it goes back
on its back, right?

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:33.938 align:middle line:90%
It just goes open.

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:36.441 align:middle line:90%
Just naturally.

00:44:36.441 --> 00:44:39.811 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
paralyzed but in a good way.

00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:41.746 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't want to
move, what, are you kidding me?

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:43.148 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You don't
want to move, right.

00:44:43.148 --> 00:44:45.316 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And I might just all
of a sudden just go blank

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:48.753 align:middle line:84%
and not know what else happened
for the next 40 minutes.

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:51.656 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: When you facilitate these
sessions, these activations,

00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:55.293 align:middle line:84%
the trainings and the workshops
an the intensives that you do,

00:44:55.293 --> 00:44:58.363 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest complaint
that you hear from people

00:44:58.363 --> 00:45:03.902 align:middle line:84%
when they're talking with
you about their story?

00:45:03.902 --> 00:45:06.938 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Okay, so my
ideal client appears

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:11.342 align:middle line:84%
to be one that's tried
all of the systems,

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:14.646 align:middle line:84%
all of the teachers,
healers and he's still stuck,

00:45:14.646 --> 00:45:18.016 align:middle line:84%
one place that's stuck and they
can't get unstuck to like bust

00:45:18.016 --> 00:45:21.019 align:middle line:90%
through that last illusion.

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:23.888 align:middle line:90%
It usually has to do with money.

00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:28.793 align:middle line:84%
They have the gifts but they're
not consciously knowing how

00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:30.328 align:middle line:90%
to apply the gifts.

00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:33.031 align:middle line:84%
And they're struggling
with the sense

00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of not enough money
to do my mission.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:90%
That's whom I get mostly.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:44.209 align:middle line:84%
Although we do get
people that don't know how

00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:49.814 align:middle line:84%
to shift an illness
that are healers already

00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:53.284 align:middle line:90%
and that do healing work.

00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:54.652 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's interesting.

00:45:54.652 --> 00:45:58.489 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And then we have another
category of I've got talents

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:01.826 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know how to use it.

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:02.794 align:middle line:90%
Where's my tab?

00:46:02.794 --> 00:46:04.195 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:46:04.195 --> 00:46:07.832 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you do the same type
of activation for that person?

00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:09.667 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Well, we can
specialize obviously, right,

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.069 align:middle line:84%
because you can do
anything in a quantum.

00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:13.605 align:middle line:90%
You can specialize, right?

00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:16.341 align:middle line:90%
Specialty ways and intentions.

00:46:16.341 --> 00:46:21.145 align:middle line:84%
But actually you can do one way
for everyone but specialized

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.914 align:middle line:90%
with their particular needs.

00:46:22.914 --> 00:46:24.415 align:middle line:90%
See, you can do anything.

00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:28.853 align:middle line:84%
You can get really creative with
understanding of how waves work.

00:46:28.853 --> 00:46:30.588 align:middle line:90%
So waves are always working.

00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:33.525 align:middle line:84%
It comes through when you're
talking, when you're writing,

00:46:33.525 --> 00:46:35.059 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
obviously your TV show.

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:36.361 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And so when you're

00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.464 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum everything
is possible, is that right?

00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yes, but according to
divine right timing, right?

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.039 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, oh, Kenji, well,
it didn't manifest tonight.

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:50.174 align:middle line:84%
Like, okay, I give
it like six hours.

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:52.243 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be a
little logical --

00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:55.346 align:middle line:84%
not logical but commonsensible
in that

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:56.848 align:middle line:84%
as you're ready it's
going to show up.

00:46:56.848 --> 00:46:59.784 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to control
it because you don't know

00:46:59.784 --> 00:47:01.419 align:middle line:90%
when it's going to show up.

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:03.021 align:middle line:84%
They don't come through
a messenger.

00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Can you reverse
the healing

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.191 align:middle line:90%
if you go back to your old ways?

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.092 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:09.594 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You can.

00:47:09.594 --> 00:47:10.862 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: You know that one.

00:47:10.862 --> 00:47:15.667 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can because sometimes,
oh this is so strange,

00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes the people are
given freedom and they freak

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.806 align:middle line:84%
out because there's
no parameters.

00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:23.107 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:47:23.107 --> 00:47:24.709 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Uh-huh, people
need structure, yes.

00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:26.544 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And they might
go, well let me see,

00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:29.314 align:middle line:84%
the safe zone is the
illness that I had.

00:47:29.314 --> 00:47:30.415 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of course.

00:47:30.415 --> 00:47:32.483 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: I can go back
just for a little bit.

00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:35.253 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, we've
had many instances

00:47:35.253 --> 00:47:37.822 align:middle line:90%
where totally gone, pain free.

00:47:37.822 --> 00:47:41.059 align:middle line:84%
They come into a session and
they're like hurting everywhere

00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:42.427 align:middle line:84%
and in every aspect
of their life.

00:47:42.427 --> 00:47:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And they leave absolutely
blissed out and pain free.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:48.199 align:middle line:84%
Now, how long do they stay
that way depends on them.

00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:51.402 align:middle line:84%
It could be forever, it
could be for three weeks.

00:47:51.402 --> 00:47:53.237 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting, interesting.

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:56.341 align:middle line:84%
So it would be good for
someone to know coming

00:47:56.341 --> 00:48:00.111 align:middle line:84%
out of the session to have
the experience of that type

00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:02.947 align:middle line:84%
of freedom to really understand
that you can have that.

00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:04.983 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, they pretty
much 99 percent do.

00:48:04.983 --> 00:48:06.084 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And it can last.

00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:07.418 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: And it can last.

00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:10.655 align:middle line:84%
And we suggest that you
don't recreate your old ways.

00:48:10.655 --> 00:48:12.557 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, habits, patterns.

00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:13.458 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Here's the thing, though.

00:48:13.458 --> 00:48:14.792 align:middle line:90%
If you go back to an environment

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:17.562 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't support your
quantumness you can create --

00:48:17.562 --> 00:48:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Over again.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.298 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes, instantly.

00:48:20.298 --> 00:48:23.868 align:middle line:84%
You go back into your
household, your family situation

00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:25.536 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to see
you still the same way

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:29.107 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
go, oh, I hurt again.

00:48:29.107 --> 00:48:32.610 align:middle line:84%
When when you came out
it was like totally free.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.045 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So that's why it's
a good thing to learn

00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to do this on yourself.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.018 align:middle line:84%
This diagram kind of gives a
great illustration on how to --

00:48:40.018 --> 00:48:43.755 align:middle line:84%
where the subconscious is,
where the unconscious is

00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:44.956 align:middle line:90%
and where the conscious is.

00:48:44.956 --> 00:48:46.557 align:middle line:90%
And if you were to look at this

00:48:46.557 --> 00:48:49.394 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum way I guess
you could say that --

00:48:49.394 --> 00:48:52.397 align:middle line:84%
well, you can explain
this a little big clearer.

00:48:52.397 --> 00:48:54.832 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is
what's down below.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:57.668 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: At the bottom there,
yes, where the core is.

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.971 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that's
where it's sharp.

00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:02.206 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, it's
sharp, be careful.

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:04.709 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: The conscious
mind is what we see.

00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:06.677 align:middle line:84%
The unconscious mind
is in the middle there

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.946 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious mind is
what we see above that.

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.148 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:13.184 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So could you take
the quantum and compare it

00:49:13.184 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to the same picture and say
the quantum is what's beneath

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.559 align:middle line:84%
or around, it's a
whole world around us.

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:24.295 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even
necessarily beneath is.

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:27.865 align:middle line:84%
It's not what we see
with the conscious mind

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:30.935 align:middle line:84%
but it's everything
else that's around us.

00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:32.503 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, it's
like that empty space

00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:34.105 align:middle line:84%
between the particles
in your brain

00:49:34.105 --> 00:49:36.774 align:middle line:84%
or your mind, yeah,
that's quantum.

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:39.811 align:middle line:84%
That's how I jump DNA, they
say, well, we don't know.

00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:43.147 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's also what
they call consciousness.

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, because that's
all we are is awareness, right.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.785 align:middle line:84%
So we chose, okay,
let's come into a body,

00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:49.353 align:middle line:84%
let's squeeze ourselves
really down here.

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:51.656 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God, that's really bad.

00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:54.158 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we didn't realize
it was this bad.

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:56.294 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we didn't realize
it was this dense.

00:49:56.294 --> 00:49:59.497 align:middle line:84%
When we were born we
though, okay, yeah,

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:00.465 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't realize.

00:50:00.465 --> 00:50:01.699 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:03.267 align:middle line:84%
I had Dr. Eben Alexander
[phonetic] here

00:50:03.267 --> 00:50:09.173 align:middle line:84%
who is the neurosurgeon who
had the near death experience.

00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:11.109 align:middle line:84%
And he said to all of
the parts of the brain

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:13.511 align:middle line:84%
that he's studied there
is no one local place

00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.614 align:middle line:84%
that he has found
consciousness to be in.

00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:19.584 align:middle line:84%
Because when he had the
near death experience it was

00:50:19.584 --> 00:50:21.419 align:middle line:90%
all over.

00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:25.289 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a specific quadrant or
localized section of the brain.

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:26.591 align:middle line:84%
He knows the sections
it wouldn't be.

00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting to
even hear a neurosurgeon say

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.096 align:middle line:84%
that who has gone in and
worked through the brain

00:50:32.096 --> 00:50:37.135 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness doesn't exist
in a specific spot in the brain.

00:50:37.135 --> 00:50:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It's actually
all around your body.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.872 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's all around, yes.

00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:42.273 align:middle line:90%
It's all around.

00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It's all that invisible
stuff unless you're clairvoyant

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.945 align:middle line:84%
then you see the effects
of your consciousness

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:48.746 align:middle line:90%
through the auric field.

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:50.448 align:middle line:90%
But that's not even you,

00:50:50.448 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that's just a reflection
of soul energy.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.787 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: The auric field?

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.023 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes, it's a reflection.

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:84%
It's still not you because
the you is undefinable.

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:05.463 align:middle line:84%
As the mystics say you
cannot define the real you.

00:51:05.463 --> 00:51:07.365 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond words.

00:51:07.365 --> 00:51:09.867 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
why they say that.

00:51:09.867 --> 00:51:12.069 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, what about the
photographs that show the --

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:13.371 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Just the effects.

00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:17.375 align:middle line:84%
The Kirlian photography is
a very basic representation

00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:21.579 align:middle line:84%
of just the auric emanations of
your body, not your awareness.

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:23.447 align:middle line:90%
Kirlian can't do consciousness.

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It can do that.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.752 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I see, okay.

00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:30.288 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And the aura photos,
again, it's just a reflection.

00:51:30.288 --> 00:51:32.223 align:middle line:90%
They're not copying the soul.

00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:33.191 align:middle line:90%
They're not photographing.

00:51:33.191 --> 00:51:33.958 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.226 align:middle line:90%
It's not high enough to --

00:51:35.226 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Capture the soul.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.461 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Right.

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But in what you do do you
look deeper into the soul level

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:43.634 align:middle line:90%
of what the soul wants?

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:44.468 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Here's how I do.

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.638 align:middle line:90%
I feel, I feel the connection.

00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:50.508 align:middle line:84%
See, our eyes can deceive
us even clairvoyantly.

00:51:50.508 --> 00:51:54.412 align:middle line:84%
So there is a level where we
say you need to transcend that.

00:51:54.412 --> 00:51:55.513 align:middle line:90%
Me and [inaudible] talked

00:51:55.513 --> 00:51:57.915 align:middle line:84%
about transcending the
sixth chakra thing.

00:51:57.915 --> 00:52:02.019 align:middle line:84%
You have to go into pure
knowing with feeling.

00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:05.556 align:middle line:84%
So when we work I felt
into you just naturally.

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:07.892 align:middle line:90%
I just in like half a second.

00:52:07.892 --> 00:52:11.028 align:middle line:84%
And I could sense how you were
going to receive the session.

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:12.463 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:14.632 align:middle line:90%
You did really good, yeah.

00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:16.534 align:middle line:90%
Because you were ready.

00:52:16.534 --> 00:52:18.903 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well, you told me that.

00:52:18.903 --> 00:52:19.937 align:middle line:90%
You said be open.

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:21.873 align:middle line:90%
You said that, yeah.

00:52:21.873 --> 00:52:24.408 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: When someone said to
Lisa, Lisa goes okay, be open,

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:27.778 align:middle line:90%
no big deal, I could do that.

00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:31.882 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's part of
my purpose as is yours.

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:34.285 align:middle line:84%
I mean what is your
purpose in doing all this?

00:52:34.285 --> 00:52:35.653 align:middle line:90%
What is it, Kenji.

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.722 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It's like what we've been
discussing is helping people

00:52:37.722 --> 00:52:41.425 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they're
more than their experiences

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:43.995 align:middle line:84%
and there is a way
out of this mess.

00:52:43.995 --> 00:52:45.763 align:middle line:90%
And it's through receiving.

00:52:45.763 --> 00:52:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And that there was never any
original anything or a fall

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.570 align:middle line:84%
from anyplace, and you
can just let that go

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.505 align:middle line:90%
because it's not real.

00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:57.842 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's real is
the power of love that you feel

00:52:57.842 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:84%
when you connect in your soul
signature, when you connect

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:90%
in this place behind the heart.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.151 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of your
head and go to that place.

00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:08.653 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Absolutely,
yeah, absolutely.

00:53:08.653 --> 00:53:11.489 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And that's the thing
that can shift your life.

00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:14.358 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And what is your
vision for all of us?

00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:18.229 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Living in
peace, eternal peace.

00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:19.764 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: In the body.

00:53:19.764 --> 00:53:21.132 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: In the body,
on the new earth.

00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:22.633 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: On the new earth, uh-huh.

00:53:22.633 --> 00:53:25.803 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Living in conscious
community, yes, where we've got

00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:29.273 align:middle line:84%
to literally create civilization
over again but the right way,

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:34.145 align:middle line:84%
and we all know that is, the
right way, harmony, cooperation.

00:53:34.145 --> 00:53:38.416 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you think that we
can do this on a quantum level

00:53:38.416 --> 00:53:41.285 align:middle line:90%
in this current lifetime?

00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:42.053 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:53:42.053 --> 00:53:43.954 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Have you seen that?

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:49.393 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: No, but see the --
okay, backtrack just quickly.

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:53.464 align:middle line:84%
So apparently divine
intervention took place

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:84%
because the earth is
[inaudible] like fall

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.304 align:middle line:84%
into the side, did
some sidetracks.

00:54:00.304 --> 00:54:04.275 align:middle line:84%
So I guess some of us
created beings that said, hey,

00:54:04.275 --> 00:54:08.312 align:middle line:84%
about another planet, though,
that would be like this

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:90%
that was supposed to be.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.881 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we do that?

00:54:10.881 --> 00:54:15.319 align:middle line:84%
And then have the light
weavers when they're done

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:19.757 align:middle line:84%
with here go live over there
because they wanted to create

00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:22.259 align:middle line:84%
that over here but
it's not possible

00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:24.996 align:middle line:84%
because the system is not
letting them because of rules

00:54:24.996 --> 00:54:27.832 align:middle line:84%
and regulations and
everything else and the wars.

00:54:27.832 --> 00:54:29.033 align:middle line:90%
Okay, let's do that.

00:54:29.033 --> 00:54:31.335 align:middle line:84%
So there is actually,
and there's proof,

00:54:31.335 --> 00:54:33.804 align:middle line:90%
there is an earthlike planet --

00:54:33.804 --> 00:54:35.439 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Proof.

00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:39.043 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: That NASA has --
proof, physical proof,

00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:42.613 align:middle line:90%
but it's higher dimensions.

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.682 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I mean I believe
that's how the quantum works.

00:54:44.682 --> 00:54:46.984 align:middle line:84%
That's how you can quantum
jump into the future

00:54:46.984 --> 00:54:48.652 align:middle line:84%
and create what you
want in the now.

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:51.255 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, we're going to
quantum jump into a new earth.

00:54:51.255 --> 00:54:54.191 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's basically
what the law of attraction

00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:56.727 align:middle line:84%
without creating the cars and
the bells and the whistle.

00:54:56.727 --> 00:54:59.163 align:middle line:90%
It's going into the future.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:01.365 align:middle line:84%
If you believe its
visualization, whatever it is,

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:04.602 align:middle line:84%
and then reverse
engineering it backwards.

00:55:04.602 --> 00:55:05.736 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: Yes.

00:55:05.736 --> 00:55:08.606 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so that is
your vision for us all.

00:55:08.606 --> 00:55:15.212 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: Yeah, living in peace and
harmony and expressing our gifts

00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:17.715 align:middle line:90%
like nobody's business.

00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:19.917 align:middle line:90%
But that's not all.

00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:24.021 align:middle line:84%
Because, see the universe,
and I'm dead serious,

00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:84%
the universe is watching
what we do.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:31.462 align:middle line:84%
So when they see us creating
a new earth we're going to be

00:55:31.462 --> 00:55:33.864 align:middle line:84%
like communicating with
them and so they can take

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:35.766 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge back
to their home planet.

00:55:35.766 --> 00:55:40.838 align:middle line:84%
Because their home planet is
disturbed as well you see.

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.873 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes, believe
it or not, are on us

00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:45.709 align:middle line:90%
and how we do this here.

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:47.411 align:middle line:84%
They are seeing it,
oh, we don't want to do

00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:49.380 align:middle line:90%
like how they're doing that.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.415 align:middle line:84%
We want examples of
what's going to work.

00:55:51.415 --> 00:55:52.550 align:middle line:90%
That's where we come in.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.352 align:middle line:84%
That's like our ambassadorial
kind of role.

00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:56.754 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's what
light weavers do.

00:55:56.754 --> 00:55:58.589 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: It's like we
are ambassadors, right,

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:02.927 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to communicate
with beings from other systems.

00:56:02.927 --> 00:56:07.665 align:middle line:84%
Actually we may go to their
home planet for a visit

00:56:07.665 --> 00:56:10.401 align:middle line:84%
like a conference and
give them the map,

00:56:10.401 --> 00:56:11.602 align:middle line:90%
the template, the grids.

00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:13.437 align:middle line:84%
Okay, here's how we're
creating new earth.

00:56:13.437 --> 00:56:14.772 align:middle line:90%
And here's what the animals do.

00:56:14.772 --> 00:56:17.541 align:middle line:84%
And here's how all
these people that come

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:20.144 align:middle line:84%
from other cultures are
now living in peace.

00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:21.579 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Because what
you're talking

00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:23.481 align:middle line:90%
about today is very abstract.

00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:26.784 align:middle line:84%
And some people completely
understand what you're talking

00:56:26.784 --> 00:56:28.686 align:middle line:84%
about, some people
are very curious.

00:56:28.686 --> 00:56:31.922 align:middle line:84%
So that put it to a
nice imagery there.

00:56:31.922 --> 00:56:34.458 align:middle line:84%
>> KK: And the pillars
of light are kind

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.695 align:middle line:84%
of like the four corners
there, the diagram.

00:56:37.695 --> 00:56:39.964 align:middle line:84%
You've got your guardian
angels there.

00:56:39.964 --> 00:56:43.534 align:middle line:84%
You've got other angelic
beings and masters around you.

00:56:43.534 --> 00:56:44.535 align:middle line:90%
You're meditating.

00:56:44.535 --> 00:56:45.636 align:middle line:84%
You've got your guardian
angel there off

00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:47.071 align:middle line:84%
to the right shoulder,
that's really cool.

00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:48.005 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yup, that's great.

00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:49.673 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful way to end

00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:52.343 align:middle line:84%
because it shows exactly what
it is that we've been talking

00:56:52.343 --> 00:56:53.744 align:middle line:90%
about through this whole show.

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking for a visual
this is a great way to do it.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.114 align:middle line:90%
Thank you s much, Kenji --

00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:58.215 align:middle line:90%
>> KK: You're welcome.

00:56:58.215 --> 00:56:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- for sharing
everything with us.

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:01.418 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the energy
transmission throughout this

00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:04.255 align:middle line:84%
entire show that will
last beyond the show.

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:05.289 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:07.591 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
your vision for all

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:11.161 align:middle line:90%
of us because there's mine.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:13.264 align:middle line:84%
