00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And joining me today
is Dr. Baskaran Pillai.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
He's a spiritual scientist,
an academic scholar,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and a world thought
leader who's been featured

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
in Time magazine for
his deep commitment

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to helping people
across the globe

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
realize their full
human potential.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Pillai is an
enlightened master.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
He's from the South
Indian Siddha tradition,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.145 align:middle line:84%
which is an unbroken
ancient lineage

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual scientists.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And they've reached the
pinnacle of human evolution.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BASKARAN PILLAI:
I'm delighted.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.906 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I am, too.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:49.345 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about what
we can talk about here.

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
tell me a little bit

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
about your upbringing
and where you grew up,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and how you got involved
with the Siddha tradition.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.795 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So I was born in
an island in southern India.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
When I grew up, in that
island, that island is known

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
for its special quality,
which is, all over the world,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
people come to the island
for removing their karma.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
There are some 27 wells in
the island, in the temple.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They're called a temple--
the waters in the well

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:90%
are capable of removing karma.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.155 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.303 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in a
background of spirituality.

00:01:45.303 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But I did not know all
of it until I grew up.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was your family a
family of spiritual healers?

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
My family lived
close to the temple,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and my brother was an
officer in the temple.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was in charge of
the sanctum santorum.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.652 align:middle line:84%
So we have a spiritual
background as a family.

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A long lineage of it.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And would you see people go
in and out of the temple?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
What was your
perspective as a child?

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: As a child,
I did not know much.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But then, although I was
very attracted to the Buddha,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:90%
even when I was very young.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Although the Buddha was
a renegade and never

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
conformed to
Hinduism, because he

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
believed that there
was no God, no soul.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
That was very revolutionary for
him to do it in sixth century

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
BC, which is 600
years before Christ,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
he said there was
no God and no soul

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
All that you need to do
is to experience nirvana,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
which is emptiness of the mind.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
So I was attracted to that.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So even as a boy, I used to have
a small picture of the Buddha

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and would go and meditate before
him, not knowing too much.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But what attracted me was his
concept of non-violence, which

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Jainism and things like that,
you should not harm anyone.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we started out.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not knowing too many
things about the Buddha.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Without reading
extensively, but feeling

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.737 align:middle line:90%
the essence.

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Feeling the
essence of meditation.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.794 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing that.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When you very young?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.907 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Very young.

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Then later on, and
I went to college

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and did some studies
in Buddhist literature.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I studied all of
Shakespeare's plays.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just really wanted
to go and teach in England.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.995 align:middle line:84%
And these were my aspirations,
never knowing my future.

00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the link between
Shakespeare and the Buddha?

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I just was
interested in literature.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And later on, I do not know.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was
something in my soul

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that attracted me
to Shakespeare.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Somebody has done some research
on myself and Shakespeare.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.051 align:middle line:90%
And it has been published.

00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.845 align:middle line:84%
Because I find Shakespeare
very spiritual.

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.811 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
very spiritual man.

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, his
works have lasted

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:39.774 align:middle line:90%
for centuries for a reason.

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Because the
last play of Shakespeare

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is "The Tempest," where he talks
about the whole world is maya.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.182 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's very
psychological, as well.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.686 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And was there
a strong emphasis

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:90%
on education in your family?

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Of going to study?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.751 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Of course, of course.

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:55.365 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you carried that
on and you went to school.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And how did-- was the
tradition of the Siddha someone

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that you-- that inspired you?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I came to the
Siddha tradition later on.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.975 align:middle line:84%
I started with
the Beatles' guru.

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So after my bachelor's
in British literature,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I just joined-- even
after my master's.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a master's in
American literature, too.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I was attracted
to the Beatles' guru.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whose name was?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.313 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Who is the founder of the
transcendental mediation

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you meet him?

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Well, he-- after
he established himself

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
in the West, he
came back to India.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching
in India through many

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.065 align:middle line:90%
of his Western disciples.

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was attracted
to his teachings,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
particularly because
he was explaining

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
everything in a scientific way.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And I have a scientific mind.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So I was attracted to the
teachings, especially when he

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:84%
proved that medication can
improve your understanding

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
and change your brain.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
So that attracted me.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you
interested in that

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
from the neurochemical
perspective

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.931 align:middle line:84%
or from the spiritual
perspective?

00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:17.556 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Both.

00:06:17.556 --> 00:06:18.032 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or both?

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:18.532 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Both.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I wanted proof, because I wanted
to contemporize my teachings.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you use
the contemporary language,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:90%
people won't understand it.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
proof for everything.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And that also helps
to understand,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
in a more precise and
deeper way, meditation.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when a guru
teaches meditation,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and when you get
into those teachings

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and you experience that
state of bliss and nirvana,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:90%
what happens in the brain?

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Well,
the-- in the brain--

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
so when we are now talking
to each other, the brain,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
the frontal lobe is very active.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Because that is where you
have the knowledge that you

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
are Lisa for instance,
and I am who I am.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
All this information
is in the frontal lobe.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.502 align:middle line:84%
So that is what gives
us our ego identity.

00:07:18.502 --> 00:07:19.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And then if you go a
little above the parietal lobe,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it also gives an understanding
of where you are,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
which place you are
sitting, all these things.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.585 align:middle line:90%
But these things will recede.

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:32.425 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Then they will have
no identity at all.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In meditation.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.725 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:38.367 align:middle line:84%
You can go to that
state in meditation.

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.925 align:middle line:84%
Where you actually let
go of the egoic mind.

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Completely.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And it usually takes about
two hours to do that.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the beginning,
when you are sitting,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
how do you-- and I'm sure you've
done this for so long-- how do

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
you start to eliminate
and wash away the ego?

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.615 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You just start with
examining what is happening.

00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts are
coming to your mind.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.729 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't identify
yourself with the thoughts,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.195 align:middle line:90%
and you watch the thoughts.

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, the thoughts
do not belong to you.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.189 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous saying
in Tibetan Buddhism:

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:90%
thoughts are your guests.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:90%
They check in and check out.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:90%
You are the host.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Your real self is the gap
in between the two thoughts.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
There is a gap in
between the two thoughts.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.372 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to meditate,
the gaps will keep increasing.

00:08:40.372 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It gets bigger.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And then
there comes a time

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
when you do not know who
you are, or you're thinking

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, and the
mind disappears.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, you can
get into your higher self.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
have the thoughts

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and they attach to the
ego, does that mean

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:90%
that the gap is not there?

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.251 align:middle line:90%
That there is no gap, right?

00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: When there is a
gap, there is no experience.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:90%
There is no experience at all.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.454 align:middle line:84%
Momentarily, there
won't be experience.

00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no judgment.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.911 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: No judgment, nothing.

00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:90%
You do not know.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It is an out of body experience.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Or out of mind experience.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.645 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It is something
like you are sleeping.

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.322 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has some
experience of of it

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:90%
during sleep.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Because during sleep,
the mind disappears.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens is,
there's no awareness in sleep.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:90%
You lose everything.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.019 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: But in this
condition, you are aware.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:36.185 align:middle line:90%
You are aware of your sleep.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
You know that you're sleeping.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when somebody
has an experience

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.763 align:middle line:84%
of-- maybe a near
death experience.

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:46.846 align:middle line:90%
And I had this experience.

00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the state
that you're saying,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that
it is accessing

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.187 align:middle line:90%
a different dimension?

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or is it just
the absence of ego?

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.314 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.314 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It is
the absence of ego

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.265 align:middle line:84%
that leads you to experience
an non-egocentric mind.

00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.978 align:middle line:90%
But is it a different--

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Which access
different realms.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
There are several
states of consciousness.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Innumerable states
of consciousness.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Usually, they say it's only
seven states of consciousness.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's only an
arbitrary calculation.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
states of consciousness.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You can go up and up and up.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Even when you
[INAUDIBLE] to your god,

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the gods are also still
trying to go up beyond.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.532 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's not an actual place.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a state.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Different dimensions
are different states

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.735 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:40.735 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.443 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're not local.

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
There's not a different
universe somewhere.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
See the mind-- as long
as there is the mind,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:90%
the world will be there.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
If the mind is not there,
the world will not be there.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.987 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you
go to sleep now.

00:10:56.987 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
What happens to the world?

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
The world disappears.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.683 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:59.683 --> 00:11:00.524 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And we wake
up in the morning,

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:90%
the world appears again.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why there is a philosophy
in Buddhism called Chittamatra,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:90%
which means the mind only.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing exists except the mind.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.445 align:middle line:84%
If this mind disappears, then
the world will disappear.

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So in sleep, the
mind disappears.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why we do not know
what's around, where are you,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
nothing is there.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you wake up,
it comes back up again.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But this is only
a mind experience.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.385 align:middle line:84%
When you go beyond the mind,
then there is another mind.

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
There are several
layers of mind.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.425 align:middle line:84%
And those minds reveal
different realities.

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:90%
There will be, say, 10 heavens.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:90%
You can go to heaven number one.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And for which you have
to have a different mind.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Heaven number two, heaven number
three, heaven number four.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:90%
You can go on like that.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So the-- depending upon
the level of consciousness

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you have, level of
the mind you have,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you will be revealed
a territory.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So does this universe
that we're in right here,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
right now exist
anywhere but our mind?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
It's only the mind.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.316 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.316 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's only the mind.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So what you and I are looking
at right now is only our mind.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: It's only our mind.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it really exist?

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: This is really dumb.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Very dumb.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.525 align:middle line:84%
We are not using our
full potential at all.

00:12:27.525 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So we are only aware of
the mind, that, you know,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
her show's name is
Aware show, okay.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I liked it.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
aware of the mind.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the mind only lets
you to experience only

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:90%
what the mind allows you to.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
So it creates its own reality.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Then if you go beyond the mind
to another level of the mind,

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
then there is another territory.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:90%
There is astral plane.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:90%
There is causal plane.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
There is super causal plane.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:90%
You can go on.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's been names
that have been given to those.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But your experience

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
have you perfected
the art of traveling

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%

00:13:19.662 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
do you create in that space?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You can go to, for
instance, the astral plane.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go
into the astral plane,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
the astral plane is still
there within everybody.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is we
are not activating that.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
When you activate that, then
you have access to that.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a
topography where you

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
can see the river, the
mountain, all these things

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.735 align:middle line:84%
are there, except that
they are more beautiful.

00:13:45.735 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
There are angels there.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And they don't suffer like we
do suffer, because they don't

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
have the flesh
and blood reality.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So you go on, one step above,
and then see different beings.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And then another topography
that reveals you another realm.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea is that
you have to get to a level

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:90%
where there's nothing.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.602 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's just nothing.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.893 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: There's nothing.

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
That is why the Buddha
called it nirvana.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no typography.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, nothing.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no angels?

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.103 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: There's nothing there.

00:14:22.103 --> 00:14:22.621 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.346 align:middle line:90%
Everything is gone.

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything is gone.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.095 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
state is something

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that-- it took you how long
to understand or to really

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
go there?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It doesn't come
to you in one lifetime.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.135 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:14:37.135 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
If you are born
with that faculty,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
then it will be available
to you very easily.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a matter
of remembering that.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the near
death experience

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I had was maybe just
the first dimension.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.144 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:90%
And it changed my whole life.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That, just by visiting
that one layer

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about suffering.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
You say that suffering is
only suffering of the mind.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.991 align:middle line:90%
Of the body, too.

00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.301 align:middle line:84%
So we have pain
sensors in our body.

00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
physical part of it.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So say you have dental work
done, and it's painful.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
It detects certain
nerve centers,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and there's pain that
registers to the pain

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
center of the brain.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.689 align:middle line:90%
That's physical.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:24.313 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:15:24.313 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you disassociate
from that physical pain?

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: It's very difficult.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:90%
It is very difficult.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why my teaching,
my main teaching-- and I

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
have about a couple of
hundred people who follow me.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very committed to them,
they're very committed to me.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But that teaching is to
turn the body into light.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.346 align:middle line:84%
Unless you do that, no
matter how rich you become,

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you become a billionaire
or multibillionaire,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
but still you have to
still deal with your body.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You still have to
deal with your mind.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And the mind will bother you,
the body will bother you.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
non-physical existence--

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
because the reality
of the matter

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the matter
doesn't exist.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.455 align:middle line:84%
So we are taking the
non-reality as reality.

00:16:23.455 --> 00:16:25.887 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.887 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the reality?

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The reality is we
are pure light.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When pain registers,
if you turn it into light,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:90%
then it could disappear?

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.508 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: No it cannot.

00:16:36.508 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Unless you turn the body
completely into light,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:90%
then you will be in pain.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen this
in so many people,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
so many evolved beings.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Highly evolved beings,
like Ramana Maharshi.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who has been
acknowledged by everyone.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
When he passed away, a
comet appeared in the sky.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And Carl Jung went to see him.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.264 align:middle line:84%
You know, traveling to India
when there was no airplane.

00:17:07.264 --> 00:17:08.318 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
And when he looked at him,
he did not even talk to him.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.713 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
know the language,

00:17:13.713 --> 00:17:14.629 align:middle line:90%
each other's language.

00:17:14.629 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.022 align:middle line:84%
Jung told him, looking at him,
I did not ask him any question.

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I had a diarrhea.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
With all that experience,
I looked at this man

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with a loincloth, and my mind
went into a kind of bliss.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And he paid a great
tribute to him.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.105 align:middle line:84%
Said he's the whitest
spot in the white sky.

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But even that Ramana
Maharshi had cancer.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.735 align:middle line:90%
And he was roaring in pain.

00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The doctor who was attending
on him, who resigned his job

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to be just
his personal attendant,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
he told him what is
this happening to you?

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You have been meditating
for about 70 years,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.925 align:middle line:90%
you know, all your life.

00:18:02.925 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And you are suffering
from this cancer pain.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you say that
the body is not real,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.869 align:middle line:84%
the mind is not real,
all these things.

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, really, I have
a great respect for you,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:84%
but this is not acceptable
because I'm a medical doctor.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just cautioning
you or insulting you,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.404 align:middle line:84%
but this simply
doesn't make any sense.

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Then what's the difference
between you and me?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.555 align:middle line:84%
Now you say that the body is not
real, but why are you crying?

00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Why are you roaring in pain?

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: This question is
applicable to all the people

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
whom I have great respect
for, who also reached

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
a very high level
of enlightenment.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But then, they did not know
how to deal with the body.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the
enlightenment is not just

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
simply for the mind, or
psychological enlightenment.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:90%
It's still an enlightenment.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll be liberated
from your thoughts.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So you will not be
bothered by the thoughts.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.635 align:middle line:84%
You will not be worried
if somebody related to you

00:19:07.635 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
dies or you lose your money
or lose your belongings.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:90%
That will not bother you.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're psychologically
liberated,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty good.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You can, again, get a
thought whenever you want.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't want a
thought, you can push it out.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of a
liberty will be there.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.211 align:middle line:84%
But still, with regard to
the body of your cancer,

00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:90%
then you will have pain.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.986 align:middle line:90%
That you cannot avoid.

00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.193 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:19:35.193 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
For that, what you need to
do is-- you may be like,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was very closely
associated with Norman Cousins.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh really, yes.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And then he
was here in Los Angeles.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
starting this center

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
called Psychoneuroimmunology
for the medial school here.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At UCLA, yes.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: At LA.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, mind over matter should
not be pushed to the extreme.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.673 align:middle line:84%
For instance, he said, you
know, you can take a pin

00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and then just pierce it.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Then you can pierce it strong,
and I can still bear my pain.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
It'll still be pain, and
I can somewhat control it.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
When somebody comes with axe,
then I have to really give up.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, I understand.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So that was
an example that he gave.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So you
cannot take it too far.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You cannot just
disintegrate into dust.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.196 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The body is
so real, that's why

00:20:35.196 --> 00:20:38.106 align:middle line:84%
it is very important to
turn the body into light.

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is not impossible.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.985 align:middle line:84%
Because we are now
living at a time,

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:84%
on the earth plane,
where the earth plane

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:90%
itself is ready for that.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Until now, it has not happened,
because the earth plane has--

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
mother earth has been
preparing herself

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to evolve become a light planet.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It is a dense planet, now.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are living here,
it only vibrates at 8 hertz.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reality.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a very low reality.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.155 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why do you say this
is a specific time for this?

00:21:09.155 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:90%
What's changed?

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: When the
Mayan calendar changed.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.286 align:middle line:90%
They were right.

00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The civilization ended, and a
new civilization has started.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Not the world ending.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
A new civilization
has started, that we

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:84%
are more open to
ideas like this.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have quantum
physics coming and Eisenberg

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
coming and saying the
theory of uncertainty,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing uncertain,
although Einstein did not

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:90%
believe in things like that.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, everything
is uncertain.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is possible.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a world
of complete possibilities.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the new education
that we need to learn.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.327 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He was a true visionary.

00:21:47.327 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, he said that
in such a time of density--

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We are very dense.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think we're
getting closer to the light?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do you think that
we can manifest our own healing

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.629 align:middle line:90%
using that concept of light?

00:22:03.629 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes, yes.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We can.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.635 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:22:05.635 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: See, we now
live with the conviction,

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, that when logic, our
logic, is so strong within us.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get rid
of this logical mind

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and then live in a field
of all possibilities,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:90%
then everything happens.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that you see is

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
only a reflection
of whatever inner.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:90%
So the inner is the outer.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I tell people that
if you see poverty everywhere,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
it is because the inner-- it
reflects only that reality.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have to change your
inner consciousness in order

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.382 align:middle line:90%
to see something outside.

00:22:57.382 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why that
gives a lot of hope

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
for people who are people
who have no skills,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:90%
for instance, no education.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Can they succeed?

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they can succeed in life.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your country, in
India, where you see poverty

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:90%
lining the streets.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
In many countries.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: 2,000 years ago.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not that India
is poor only today.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:90%
2000 years ago it was poor.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They asked the Siddha--
it has been translated

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in all the languages
of the world.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:90%
His name is Thiruvalluvar.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:90%
He lived 2000 years from today.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.738 align:middle line:84%
They asked him why there are
so many people poor here.

00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And he said, [SPEAKING TAMIL]

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
This is in my language, and
this is the Siddha's language.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
He said there are so
many people who are poor.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It is because they don't
know how to intend.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Intention is important.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.955 align:middle line:84%
Their intention is
focused on poverty.

00:24:00.955 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
If they can change
their intention,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
then they can see
the other reality.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:84%
If this moment you are
poor, and then you continue,

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
he says, to be in it
forever, and thinking

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:90%
that I have no hope.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:90%
You play this victim more.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But that is not the case, then
you can change your reality

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and then intend
something very beautiful.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Then that will be the reality.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So that, he says,
in 2000 years ago,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
he was saying people don't
know how to use their mind.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
How the intention is
really what matters.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, Wayne Dyer also
has a book on intention.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
know how to intend.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The intention creates
the material reality.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.367 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And Wayne is
a student of yours.

00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he has been my-- I
won't call him as a student,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
but he has used some
of my techniques.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many times.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, the techniques.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He was the one
that introduced me to you.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And so you can take these--

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: One day, I
met him in Chicago.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the last time I saw
him, several years ago.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just sent
him a note about,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.195 align:middle line:84%
beyond the sun-- beyond the
clouds, the sun is shining.

00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the clouds,
the sun is shining.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: So that's the truth.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.126 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:27.126 --> 00:25:27.694 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The sun
is always there.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Always there.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.508 align:middle line:84%
You get in an
airplane, it's there.

00:25:31.508 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: He appreciated
that very much.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
He said that was a great thing.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that I really
felt the truth behind it.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Back to the
idea of the intention.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And from what Wayne
wrote his book on,

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
the power of intention, you
can manifest this thought,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and you can turn
it into a reality.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes, yes.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly the
book that he wrote,

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.815 align:middle line:90%
which he dedicated to me.

00:25:59.815 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Manifest
Your Destiny."

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thesis point in that
book is what I gave him,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.445 align:middle line:84%
is you cannot manifest that
which you cannot conceive.

00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.326 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest that
you cannot conceive.

00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I can easily
conceive a million dollars,

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:22.852 align:middle line:90%
and I can manifest it.

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
A couple of million
dollars, I can manifest it.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Then I cannot conceal
of a billion dollars.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The day when I am able to
conceive a billion dollar,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
then I'll be able
to manifest it.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This I can transfer to
other people who are not

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:84%
be able to manifest
even a $5,000.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is
the conception.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I am introducing that.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I have about 90 centers in India
where we go and pick up people

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:90%
from the slums, boys and girls.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
bring it to our centers.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And then we teach them.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
your background is,

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:84%
your father or mother,
forget all about that.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You are an individual, you
have a great consciousness,

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and I can make you to be
a senator or a congressman

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to be.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.612 align:middle line:84%
Because you have that
potential within you.

Just forget about
all these things.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:84%

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Pillai has
a vision for how

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
we can create a new world
through our brain changing

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:90%
A world of hope.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And to us at Tripura
Foundation, that

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:90%
means heaven on planet Earth.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.345 align:middle line:90%
First, the sad truth.

00:28:13.345 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
There are about 2.2 billion
children in the world today,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and one billion of those
children live in poverty.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That is almost 50% of
the world's children,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:90%
or every other child.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, those one billion
children living in poverty,

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
as they grow older
every day, they

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
are moving closer and closer
to an adult life of suffering

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and hopelessness, just
like their parents.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Not only suffering
for themselves,

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
but possibly creating
suffering for others.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the typical
lifestyle of the poor

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:84%
involves alcohol, drugs,
perhaps even violence and crime.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Life can feel truly hopeless
for children living in poverty.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.445 align:middle line:84%
And their parents often
are doing their best

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:84%
but can't give them what they
need to have a better life.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone accepts that
children are our future.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So how can we possibly expect
to create a better world when

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:84%
we are not giving 50%
of the world's children

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:84%
what they really need
to have a better life?

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine a new world, where
those one billion poor children

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
are given exactly what
they need to have a better

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
life, a special kind of
education that can help them

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
create a new identity,
a new destiny.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Education that can teach them
to help others and give back

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to the people in
need all around them,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:90%
thus creating a new world.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.690 align:middle line:84%
This new world is not just
a dream to Dr. Pillai;

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.555 align:middle line:90%
it is a future reality.

00:29:56.555 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Through our educational
programs at Tripura Foundation

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:84%
over the past two decades,
we have witnessed the miracle

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of poor children waking
up to the brilliance

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
of their own soul and
spirit, daring to dream

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of a bright future.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And even as a child,
living as a heroic leader

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:84%
in their communities,
making it a better place.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed this
miracle countless times

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
in our many thousands of
children all over the world.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:90%
How is this miracle possible?

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.495 align:middle line:84%
We don't give just food,
clothing or academics.

00:30:32.495 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
We give Dr. Pillai's
brain changing

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.133 align:middle line:90%
and transformational education.

00:30:38.133 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a brain strengthening sound
exercise based on phonemes,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
or simple vowel sounds
that are vocalized

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
while focusing on key
parts of the brain.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We call the technique
phonemic intelligence.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We have seen that it changes a
child at their core, and to us,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.815 align:middle line:90%
it all starts with the brain.

00:30:58.815 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to work directly with
the brains of children living

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in poverty to create any
substantial or permanent change

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
in the lives of these children.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So you see, what we
perceive as the biggest

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.030 align:middle line:84%
challenge in this world, the
problem of billions of people

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
in the world living in
poverty, can actually

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
hold the key to
creating a new world.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.915 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Pillai says that our
capital is our consciousness.

00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:84%
There is tremendous capital
lying inside those one billion

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:90%
poor children living in poverty.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:84%
The capital lies in helping
them change their brains

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.267 align:middle line:90%
so they can change the word.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is
phonemic intelligence?

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Phonemic
intelligence is--

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.560 align:middle line:84%
intelligence is
contained in a phoneme.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:90%
A phoneme is a small sound.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a
syllable is a phoneme.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:90%
A distinct sound.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:84%
"Ah", the sound that I gave
to Wayne Dyer, is a phoneme.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And this has the power
to give you intelligence.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So intelligence is
nothing but sound.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
My equation is s equals i,
sound equals intelligence.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence is
located in the sound.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you are poor, then
you have mastered a sound,

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
or your brain is full of
this poverty sound that

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
gives the intelligence,
scarcity intelligence.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would you say
the sound is that the children

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: They were
just normal children.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But we give them this
sound of manifestation.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want to manifest,
you just use these syllables.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.803 align:middle line:84%
We use the syllables
like ah, eeh, ooh, aie.

00:33:01.803 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:84%
These are the
syllables which we use.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Although they're
very, very small.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have done
research on that,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
both in India and in
the United States.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.167 align:middle line:84%
And then we did some research
with this Brain Agency

00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:90%
International.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
The "ah" sound, which I
gave it to Wayne Dyer,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
it has the ability to go
very deep into the brain

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and then activate what
is called a von economo

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:84%
neuron in the
anterior cingulate.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.036 align:middle line:84%
That is the center for
unlimited intelligence.

That's what we are doing.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:84%
There are many
schools in California

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
we have introduced the
sound in San Francisco,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:90%
and also in New York.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.284 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's just "ahhh".

00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.029 align:middle line:84%
The government schools
are open to that.

00:34:13.029 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We have a place where
we have introduced that

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:90%
to government schools.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.799 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it same as om?

00:34:17.799 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: No.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Om is different.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:90%
The om has "ah" in it.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:28.349 align:middle line:84%
Om is a sound which is a
primordial sound that-- You

00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:29.770 align:middle line:84%
know, Evan Alexander,
when he went

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, through his coma,
and he had the experience of om.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed
this is one of the--

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.594 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the music.

00:34:39.594 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Now just om.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
He said that it was revealed
to him, when he was in coma,

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:90%
that om was God.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked him, did
you know about Hinduism?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
No, I did not know
anything about Hinduism.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.520 align:middle line:90%
But I was told that om is God.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.762 align:middle line:84%
So om has "ah" in it
as part of the sound.

00:35:02.762 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
give me an example?

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: See, the sound
om is comprised of three

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:90%
sounds-- "ah", "ooh", and "ma."

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:84%
For instance, "ah" will
activate your left brain.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
"Ooh" will activate
your right brain,

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and "m" will activate
your midbrain.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So I have a program called
the "Midbrain Miracle

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.015 align:middle line:84%
Method," which I prescribe
as the only program that

00:35:32.015 --> 00:35:37.325 align:middle line:84%
can help anyone to manifest what
he wants, regardless whether he

00:35:37.325 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
is a skilled person, but yes.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Whether he comes from any
race, it doesn't really matter.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So all that you have
to do is-- the midbrain

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to
get beyond the logic

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.735 align:middle line:90%
and manifest your thoughts.

00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:55.880 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Could you do it for me?

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
All that you need to do
is just close your eyes

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.126 align:middle line:90%
and then focus on your midbrain.

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:08.626 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: In between
the two hemispheres,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
just visualize the
midbrain that unites you

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:90%
with the spinal column.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:90%
The spinal column goes up.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And then on the two sides
of the spinal column

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is the two brains-- the right
brain and the left brain.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You focus only on
the midbrain, where

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:84%
there is the thalamus, where
it is the pineal gland.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And you just simply focus
on the middle of the brain.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And then say the sound "mmm."

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Mmmm.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.259 align:middle line:90%

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:90%
And then intend something.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:90%
You want a home or a car or--

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.417 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.417 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: It's good.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.977 align:middle line:90%
You are programming.

00:37:48.977 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:90%

And to the sound of it.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It definitely lightened
my brain as well

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.856 align:middle line:90%
and added a lot of oxygen to it.

00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: If you don't
intend, nothing will happen.

>>PILLAI: See, that's
what exactly happened.

00:38:03.943 --> 00:38:09.845 align:middle line:84%
You can get into your very
good transcendental trance-like

00:38:09.845 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:90%
meditative state.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.130 align:middle line:90%
And so many people are there.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.175 align:middle line:84%
That's how I differ
from other teachers.

00:38:15.175 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The other teachers say, if you
just get into a very beautiful,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
trance-like transcendental
consciousnesses,

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:90%
then you are finished.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You become thought
free, you become--

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.115 align:middle line:84%
you are not bothered
by the mind.

00:38:31.115 --> 00:38:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:90%
So you create even emptiness.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:84%
If you create
emptiness inside, you

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:90%

And then do the "mmm" sound in
the midbrain for three hours.

00:41:00.062 --> 00:41:00.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Three hours.

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Three hours straight.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.539 align:middle line:90%

it is that you want.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: First, you
have to chant "mmm"

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and then, maybe
after 10 minutes,

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
then you intend, then
chant for 10 minutes,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
then intend, until you get--
after three, if you have done

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
for three hours,
miracles will happen.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: This I call
Midbrain Miracle Method.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.910 align:middle line:84%
If we want miracles,
that's the only way.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So what is preventing
or obstructing the miracles

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to happen is the frontal lobe.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.354 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.354 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The frontal
lobe will ask forget it,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
you are not going to
get a million dollars.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
A million dollars
is a lot of money.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
interesting, because that

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
was the part of the
brain that I damaged

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.020 align:middle line:90%
when I had that experience.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was the absence
of my ego of mind.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.243 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:41:54.243 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So the
midbrain has the ability

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to manifest anything that
it is able to conceptualize.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.740 align:middle line:90%
So it has no problem.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It will not ask the question
how, why, where, when, what.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
All these things, the W-H
words, are negative words.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:90%
They are all here.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.366 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You don't care
how the money comes.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want
to-- now that it

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.487 align:middle line:84%
has to come through business,
through inheritance.

00:42:26.487 --> 00:42:26.986 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:42:26.986 --> 00:42:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:90%
These are not necessary.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And as you do it, if
you need money for something,

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
you intend it and it
shows up in your life.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.605 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have any form
that it needs to show up in.

00:42:40.605 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA:OK.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.365 align:middle line:90%
What about stress?

00:42:43.365 --> 00:42:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:84%
How can you re-frame and
actually eliminate things?

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.955 align:middle line:90%
You talked about how to create.

00:42:49.955 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:90%
How do you eliminate?

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The stress is,
again, is an activity

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.813 align:middle line:90%
of the whole neocortex.

00:42:56.813 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Not only the frontal lobe.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.490 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe plays
a very important role.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But in general, to the
top of the whole cortex,

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.350 align:middle line:84%
the reason development
of the human brain

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.835 align:middle line:84%
is responsible because
it's locked into logic.

00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.466 align:middle line:84%
And a logical person
will be always stressed.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:25.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, if he has a
disease, this disease

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.730 align:middle line:90%
is going to kill me.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Or if he's lost a job and then--
he doesn't live in the moment.

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:46.185 align:middle line:84%
Because the logic doesn't allow
him to get beyond this reality.

00:43:46.185 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a set reality.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It really occurs that
you are in logic.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:59.480 align:middle line:84%
If you become logic free,
every moment is new.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Then there is no
reason for stress.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because stress
is just attaching

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:90%
onto something that's logical.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.122 align:middle line:90%


00:44:07.122 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: And so to your ego.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.397 align:middle line:90%


00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: To your ego.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.478 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You give
meaning to things,

00:44:12.478 --> 00:44:13.695 align:middle line:90%
and that causes the stress.

00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The meaning--

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.355 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: See,
for instance, I'll

00:44:16.355 --> 00:44:21.772 align:middle line:84%
tell you one thing, that I was
with my first formal teacher,

00:44:21.772 --> 00:44:22.355 align:middle line:90%
the Maharishi.

00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to him long
time, and I was in my 20s

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.010 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:84%
He wanted 1,000 SUVs in
India, to go to the villages

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.955 align:middle line:84%
and teach meditation
and help people.

00:44:38.955 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him at
that point-- first of all,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.340 align:middle line:90%
he wanted it in a week.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.230 align:middle line:90%
He wanted 1,000 SUVs.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I said that it's not
possible, because we

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:90%
don't manufacture 1,000 SUVs.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And even if we do
get the old ones

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and all buy up everything
that's available,

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.593 align:middle line:90%
we don't have money in the bank.

00:45:05.593 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the money, I said.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, money is in the bank.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, not in our account.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, it doesn't matter.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Money is in the bank.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.870 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: OK, OK.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.718 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It doesn't
really matter.

00:45:28.718 --> 00:45:30.426 align:middle line:84%
Because he was living
that consciousness.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.456 align:middle line:90%

00:45:33.456 --> 00:45:35.705 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Oh money, he
manifested billions of dollars.

00:45:35.705 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.710 align:middle line:84%

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And the SUVs, they appeared.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Oh yeah.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%
He did not care about

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.364 align:middle line:84%

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.655 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:45:53.655 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:90%
When you know,

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.560 align:middle line:84%
at one time, the

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was a

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
this is a form of Hinduism,

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But he did not want to

I'm not Hillary Clinton.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Obama didn't think that way.

I'm black; I cannot
be the president.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.727 align:middle line:84%

I cannot become the president.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So that's why
he wrote the book called

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.220 align:middle line:90%
"The Audacity of Hope."

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:90%
He was audacious.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.146 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.146 --> 00:47:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He was.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.855 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: He was.

00:47:33.855 --> 00:47:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it is.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.675 align:middle line:84%
You cannot simply say,
I'm not the Maharishi.

00:47:36.675 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It is a reality for everyone.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:90%

about 15 years ago,
and that I was partners

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.050 align:middle line:84%
with the Rotary Club,
and then some of them

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.465 align:middle line:90%
have become doctors, engineers.

00:48:09.465 --> 00:48:10.867 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And how long have
you been doing this?

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: This one,
my own centers,

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I just started it only
three or four years ago.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But prior to that,
I used to partner

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:84%
with organizations
like the Rotary Club.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.082 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.082 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well there
is another video

I want to share with you,
which is of Dr. Pillai talking

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.500 align:middle line:84%
about the sun and the
moon consciousness.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great technique
for you to learn.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.164 align:middle line:90%

>>PILLAI: How to
get things fast.

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:46.800 align:middle line:84%
If you have watched what has
happened over the last 100

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:54.940 align:middle line:84%
years, 150 years, civilization
and evolution have moved fast.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.215 align:middle line:84%
We want everything
to happen fast.

00:49:01.215 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.185 align:middle line:90%
There's even fast food shops.

00:49:05.185 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:90%


00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.485 align:middle line:90%
Fast computers.

00:49:07.485 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's human nature
wanting to be fast.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to wait.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have also
spoken many times

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that waiting is a waste of time.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.630 align:middle line:90%
See, nobody wants to wait.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.945 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants everything
instantaneously.

00:49:28.945 --> 00:49:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is not a
bad idea at all.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as manifestation
is concerned,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I have said many times
that it takes place

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:53.030 align:middle line:90%
in a zone of no time.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Time is not involved in
manifestation at all.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, manifestation
then is instantaneous.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I've done a few small
videos for you on time

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:90%
and how to get beyond this time.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:90%


00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And I put the meditation on
the sun and the moon for you

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:90%
to practice.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, it has been lost
in the many videos I have done.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But I just want
to explain to you,

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that is the most
powerful meditation ever

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to transcend time
and to be in a place

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:84%
where you can
manifest very quick.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
What about the sun and
what about the moon

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.785 align:middle line:84%
and how they are
related to time?

00:50:48.785 --> 00:50:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So the sun and the
moon create time.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.530 align:middle line:90%
We have solar calendars.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.730 align:middle line:90%
We have lunar calendars.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And what are these calendars?

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.835 align:middle line:84%
They're just only representation
of the movement of time.

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And the sun moves
through the zodiacs.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.210 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:30.910 align:middle line:84%
365 days create one year,
and the sun and the moon

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:34.035 align:middle line:90%
move through the zodiacs.

00:51:34.035 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we created the
solar and the lunar calendar.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
arrest the movement

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:49.250 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and the
moon, then you'll

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:53.340 align:middle line:84%
see that you are in
a timeless space.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You see the symbolism
of the sun and moon

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.090 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the
Rosicrucian, too.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And they represent
the two brain--

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:84%
the sun represents
the left brain

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and the moon, the right brain.

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But the meditation is to
have the sun and the moon

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to merge within the heart.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is time
comes to a standstill.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So time and again,
you should visualize

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:90%
the sun in your heart.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And then moon getting
into the sun and merging.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to do anything.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Just have this image all the
time within your consciousness,

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.520 align:middle line:84%
then you will find the
time coming to an end.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And this technique has
come from Yoga Vasistha.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Vasistha, the greatest
guru of the world,

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.160 align:middle line:84%
tells Rama, the avatar, hey
Rama, don't do anything.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Just do this.

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Then you will see the external
reality is just an illusion.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you are the
master of the world.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is a great technique.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I want every one of you to do
this very simple technique,

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%

of benefit out of it.

There is no time

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You create time by
saying, I get paid only

on the first of every month.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.060 align:middle line:90%

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.055 align:middle line:84%

create opportunities for you.

>>PILLAI: So how do
you compress time here?

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:84%
If you make $1

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.550 align:middle line:90%
you have compressed 10 years.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.990 align:middle line:90%

>>PILLAI: You've
compressed time.

00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.940 align:middle line:90%

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%

01:00:36.276 --> 01:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I ask people-- you know,
I'm going to be in India now.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to Japan
and then after that, I

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
will be in India
for three months.

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Then what I do to
people is, you have

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to meditate for nine hours.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.230 align:middle line:90%


01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.955 align:middle line:90%

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.170 align:middle line:90%
You can be comfortable.

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:55.920 align:middle line:90%
You just lie down.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I'm not asking
you don't just sit there.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
can't fall asleep.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't fall asleep.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.196 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Even if
you fall asleep.

01:01:03.196 --> 01:01:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I just let them to fall asleep.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Because that's better than
not doing the mediation.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.125 align:middle line:90%
So they just lie down.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.510 align:middle line:90%


01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.559 align:middle line:84%
And after three
hours-- two hours,

01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
they will fight

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.160 align:middle line:90%


01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And from the third hour onwards,
the starting of the third hour,

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
they will feel bliss.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
you will develop

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.976 align:middle line:90%
this super consciousness.

01:01:31.976 --> 01:01:32.475 align:middle line:90%

>>PILLAI: And that
rejuvenates your body,

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.940 align:middle line:90%
rejuvenates your mind.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.136 align:middle line:84%
And then he doesn't
cost anything.

01:01:42.136 --> 01:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then what happens
in the sixth, seventh, eighth,

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.550 align:middle line:90%

01:01:46.347 --> 01:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: No, not nine
hours at a stretch.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Only three hours at one stretch.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I
let them go and then do

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
whatever they want to do and
then come back and then three

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.780 align:middle line:90%
hours.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.284 align:middle line:84%
And if they do nine hours,
that will be fantastic.

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:04.742 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
have totally out

01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:08.735 align:middle line:84%

>>PILLAI: I lived at

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:24.350 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%

And now, do you have--

01:02:27.545 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It was
one of the times

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that there was a guy
called J. Krishnamurti.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:34.115 align:middle line:90%


01:02:34.115 --> 01:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He was very well recognized, and
he was a very controversial man

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
too.

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he was considered the
reincarnation of the Buddha.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%


01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
He won't conform to any
philosophy, God or anything.

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And the guy in
London, David Bohm,

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.056 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the world's
renowned physicists,

01:02:58.056 --> 01:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
they together did a book
called "Ending Time."

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on--
I was reading that book.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.680 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Time and mind are
one and the same.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.710 align:middle line:90%


01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.552 align:middle line:84%
When mind disappears,
time will disappear.

01:03:17.552 --> 01:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And that time, my
mind disappeared.

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I woke
up, I was by myself.

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.780 align:middle line:90%


01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.002 align:middle line:90%
It was-- 24 hours have gone.

01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%


01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By the clock.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.240 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's incredible
stories that you have.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.220 align:middle line:90%
They are amazing.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.411 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:40.536 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I strongly
recommend people to read that.

01:03:40.536 --> 01:03:41.720 align:middle line:90%


01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Because this physicist will push
him to answer this question,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand the relationship
between time and mind.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how I developed
this program, timeline jumping.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.665 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
live this timeline.

01:03:53.665 --> 01:03:55.581 align:middle line:90%


01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:56.830 align:middle line:90%
You can have a different time.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%


01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: What usually happens
is, you select a timeline

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and then live that
timeline till you die.

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.835 align:middle line:84%
And we preselect that
idea in our minds.

01:04:08.835 --> 01:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And you
can discard that.

01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:04:11.275 --> 01:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And then get

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.295 align:middle line:84%
They are all

01:04:17.295 --> 01:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:21.015 align:middle line:84%
And do you access this

01:04:21.015 --> 01:04:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I want to access,
I always select my thought.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.760 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to think.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%

canceling and so forth.

It doesn't really matter, right?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I've canceled-- I have
canceled three times my trip

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.610 align:middle line:90%

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And it costs a lot of
money, but I don't care.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But again, I just rebooked
it and I'm leaving.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%

We have this completely--
even our soul

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.050 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you can-- it's an
assumption, you know.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Time is an assumption.

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
If we can get beyond this
assumption and remain timeless,

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.700 align:middle line:90%
then that is freedom.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: That is freedom.

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the
practical world, though,

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
you still have to abide
by certain things.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But those are on
certain days, right.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You know
that you are now

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
conditioned by time,
because we live

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.930 align:middle line:90%
in a world which is very dense.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:55.142 align:middle line:84%
And then people have
subscribed to the time concept.

01:06:55.142 --> 01:06:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Universally.

01:06:55.975 --> 01:06:57.656 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.656 --> 01:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
If universally all of
us can discard time,

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%
then we cannot grow.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
necessary that we

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
have to have a
critical mass of people

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:12.370 align:middle line:90%
living that consciousness.

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:12.911 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:14.000 align:middle line:90%


01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thank you for your time
here in this beautiful moment

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with you
where things definitely

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.230 align:middle line:90%
disappeared for me.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And time disappeared.

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.816 align:middle line:84%
And I would talk
to you forever--

01:07:27.816 --> 01:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It is
usually something

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
like, if a person is a
vacant, he can easily so,

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.615 align:middle line:90%
look at the person's eyes.

01:07:37.615 --> 01:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%


01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And pass on the energy.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.160 align:middle line:90%


01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Even Krishnamurti who did not
believe in God like the Buddha,

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
he said, all that we need is
a bunch of enlightened people.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.021 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: And if
they remain here,

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
their energy will
change the world.

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.742 align:middle line:90%
Is that your mission?

01:07:58.742 --> 01:07:59.366 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:07:59.366 --> 01:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.926 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: That's my mission.

01:08:00.926 --> 01:08:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is to awaken people.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Awaken people.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that you
can change the world.

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Mhm.

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:06.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
vibration of the world.

01:08:06.775 --> 01:08:09.705 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: That's why I said I
like your show's name, Aware.

01:08:09.705 --> 01:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Become awareness.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything is awareness.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And you gave it a whole
different meaning, I must say.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.979 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you
so much, Dr. Pillai.

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you being here,
in this state of being.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%

to enjoy watching

And until next
time, as always, I

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:34.420 align:middle line:84%
invite you to stay
aware and inspired.

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.910 align:middle line:90%
