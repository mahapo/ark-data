00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It
appears Western civilization

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
has been operating under a
fallacy at a deeply fundamental

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:84%
level-- the notion of
survival of the fittest,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.477 align:middle line:90%
or survival through competition.

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to look far
to see where this mindset has

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
taken us, beginning
with Wall Street

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:90%
and the world of politics.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But this is equally damaging
on the most personal levels.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
According to Lynne McTaggart,
author of "The Bond."

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:90%
And Lynne joins us today.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, before we
go anywhere else with this,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, this
is a must read.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:90%
This is really a must read.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're look-- it's how to
fix your following down world.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone of us can
relate to that subtitle.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
attraction to this for me

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.246 align:middle line:84%
is that you're steeping
it, as always, in science.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And last time I sat with you,
we were doing the interview

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:90%
on "The Intention Experiments."

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going into--
we're segue waying into this.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.934 align:middle line:84%
But before we even go there,
Lynne, I would like to--

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and you're everywhere.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:90%
This came in my mail.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.634 align:middle line:90%
You're everywhere.

00:01:14.634 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
You did a couple
interviews this morning

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
after coming in from
London last night.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
"The Fountainhead"

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
before we get into the
rest of this story.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.835 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
a fascinating glimpse.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you do the background
to it, and why you put it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:90%
in this particular chapter.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNNE MCTAGGART: Well, we
in America, we in the west,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
really revere our
lone wolf heroes.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether they come
in the guise of Nicolas Cage,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
or Humphrey Bogart,
or even Superman,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of the
individual with his fist up

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:90%
against the establishment.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the
real epitome of this

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
was Howard Roark in the
movie, "The Fountainhead,"

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
or the-- which came from the
book, "The Fountainhead,"

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:90%
by Ayn Rand.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And in that, Gary
Cooper is Howard Roark.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's the
uncompromising architect

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
who decides he wants to
build buildings his way.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So he builds-- he
designs a building that's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be a
public housing project.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
commissioned him change it.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:90%
They bastardize it.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's so incensed by
this that he blows it up.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And so he, of course,
is brought to trial

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
because he's destroyed
public property.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And he chooses to
defend himself.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And that gives Ayn
Rand the chance

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to give him the mouthpiece
for her philosophy, which

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.914 align:middle line:84%
is essentially an every
man for himself philosophy.

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And can I read that part?

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Definitely.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a quote from him.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It says, "The creator
who lives for his work

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
needs to no other men.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Wheeling around,
he faces the jury.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I do not recognize anyone's
right to one minute of my life,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
nor any part of my
energy, no matter

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
who makes the claim,
how large their number,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:90%
or how great their need.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The integrity of a
man's creative work

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.689 align:middle line:84%
is of greater importance than
any charitable endeavor."

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a very strong statement.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, when I saw
the movie, it's like yes, yes.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all when we see this
and the way it was portrayed

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and the way we've
been raised societally

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and individually,
you think, yes.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
One has to stand up for
one's artistic expression.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.455 align:middle line:84%
It can't be wiped out by
something more mundane.

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually
dangerous thinking

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:90%
from where you're sitting.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: It's toxic
thinking, that I mean,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
here's what happens in
the book and in the movie.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
He gets acquitted despite
having blown up a city block.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:90%
He gets the girl.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
He gets to build the
building his way.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end,
he's standing there

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:90%
like the super colossus.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
He's like the
Nietzschean Superman.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But my real point is he's the
perfect candidate for a heart

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.264 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- I just wanted to
use that as an illustration.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Because many people
have read the book,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
or they have seen the
movie with Gary Cooper.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
rousing, emotional moment

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
when he makes this speech.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And most people in the
west I think probably do

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
relate to it on an
emotional level.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's unconscious.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's unconscious.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as we're going
to see when we go further

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
into this work here, that really
has-- that part of our thinking

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:84%
has to die away to another
type of individuality

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.501 align:middle line:90%
within a collective.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:90%
But first let's talk about it.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.666 align:middle line:84%
How did you go from "The
Intention Experiment"

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:90%
into "The Bond?"

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, there
were some big reasons

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
for doing this book, and
there were some small reasons.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I've
always felt from the time

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd written "The Field" that
I had to write a book that

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.355 align:middle line:84%
basically said, how do we
live what I'd discovered.

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I discovered that we
were all part of this larger

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:90%
field, this larger energy field.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought well, that
really contradicts everything

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
we think about who we are and
how we're supposed to live.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I also felt I needed to write
a bigger part of the story.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Because many things write
the story we live by.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But science is
really the thing that

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
writes the biggest chapter.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.603 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: You know,
science defines who we are.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we determine
how we're supposed to live.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
story thus far

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
has been a story of
individualism-- extreme

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:90%
individualism.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, that life is full of
individual, very well behaved

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what Newton told us.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then Darwin told
us that those things

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
are in competition
with each other.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, we've sort
of defined life as a race

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
to the finish line.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And that has pretty much
influenced everything

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
we do in our lives,
every structure we have.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Our educational model
is built on competition.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Our business model, our
financial model, competition.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Our neighborhood
model-- god forbid

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
your neighbor gets
a Mercedes when

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
you're still driving a Ford.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Even our relationships are
very competitive these days.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So the first question I had
was, is this the right story?

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Was it supposed to be like this?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I also wanted to
try to figure out

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
why we're in the mess
we're in right now.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
All we hear everywhere
is it's the end of this.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of that.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of capitalism.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
reading the headlines

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.934 align:middle line:84%
this morning. "Wall Street
Journal" and "New York Times."

00:06:19.934 --> 00:06:20.935 align:middle line:90%
It's enough.

00:06:20.935 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:90%
The front page.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
I can't read anymore.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: No

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all falling down.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: It's
all falling down.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And so our world
is falling down.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
final reason I wrote

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
it was a very personal reason.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I have two daughters.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of my daughters
is a talented actress.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And she was given the main
role in her school play.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, she was shunted
to a more minor role.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And I could never
find out the reason

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
until another girl let slip
that a third girl had lied when

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
a new director came
on board in order

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to take over the role
given my daughter.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was appalled by this.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I went to talk
to the mom about it.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And I brought it up tactfully.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And the mother just sort
of shrugged me aside

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and said well, you
know, that's life.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was appalled by this until
I started thinking about it

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and thought well, yeah.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the life we've
created for ourselves.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, is it's
supposed to be like this?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it all supposed to
be I win, you lose?

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that got me looking into
not only physics this time,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
but biology, anthropology,
all the "ologies."

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I came
up with was no, it

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:90%
wasn't supposed to be like this.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Nature-- Darwin was wrong.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Nature hasn't designed
us to compete.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Nature has designed us,
in every way, to connect.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, nature
has designed us not

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:90%
to be individual in any way.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we are,
whether we can understand it

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
through the lens that
we've been living through,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
we are all very
deeply connected,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
not just with each other
but with our environment,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:90%
with the cosmos.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.415 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
how many thoughts a day

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
do any one of us
have that put us

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
in direct competition
with somebody

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
else down to the
most mundane levels?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:84%
As you say in your book, we're
not really living who we are,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and that every day is set
up as a battleground for one

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:84%
tiny competition after another,
to the point where no wonder

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we have high blood pressure,
obesity, and everything else.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It is extremely
anxiety-producing

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
to put ourselves in this
mode of competition.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.766 align:middle line:84%
Talk about it on some of the
mundane levels we go through.

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I love the way you
did it in your book.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.129 align:middle line:84%
Day in and day out, the ways in
which we're ready to do battle.

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, you know, we
have a metaphor of ourselves,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
or an image of ourselves as
the hero up against it all.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the way we do it.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about it,
we worry about everything

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
from the guy who's
going to usurp us

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
at our job, the kids who
are going to outperform us

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.957 align:middle line:90%
at school when we're at school.

00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, what happens if
we're at the bottom of the bell

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:90%
curve?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.466 align:middle line:84%
And these days in education,
they list who's, you know,

00:09:11.466 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
if you're in
medical school, they

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
list where you are in the
whole league basically.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in the
bottom, you know.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's, as I say,
your neighborhood.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
That's become a ground of one
upmanship and competition.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do is
framed by competition.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Our conversations
with people are

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
very much about
picking the flaws

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:90%
in someone else's arguments.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
If somebody disagrees
with us, we're

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
taught, essentially,
to demonize them

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
but also to pulverize
them, to try

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to destroy them
through our arguments.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is about
being right, being first,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:90%
being individual.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:90%
That's been our programming.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
If we have a hard drive, it's
been programmed with I win,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:90%
you lose.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm saying is this
is absolutely against nature.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
in the mess we're in.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
This is what selfish
looks like now.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.974 align:middle line:84%
Selfish looks like the breakdown
of every aspect of our society.

00:10:15.974 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going through right now.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.306 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
absolutely right.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
very mundane example

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
of that is in America
certainly, road rage.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't dare-- in California,
I don't dare signal

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to let anyone know I'm coming
into their lane anymore.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I just wait until I feel there's
a safe opportunity and go.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if you signal,
that is a direct assault

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:90%
to the other person's space.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And they'll speed up.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is common.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
This is just common.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in traffic school once,
and I told them no, I never

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
signal.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And I told them why.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other people are
saying, yeah, you're right.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So that is how
fundamental it is.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We can't even let someone have
a little space on the road,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.291 align:middle line:84%
as though we own that
space just ahead.

00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
That's sick.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's just become the
mindset that, as I say,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
pretty much dictates
everything we do.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this big problem
on a giant collective level,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and we have this problem
on an individual level.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when we
start living according

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to the definition of who we
really are, and start wiping

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
that hard drive clean,
only then will we

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%
evolve to another level.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Only then.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say it's
about the last 250 years,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
right, since this
paradigm has really

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.212 align:middle line:84%
taken hold within our
psyche, maybe even less.

00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there've always
been cases of people wanting

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:90%
to be aggressive, or whatever.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Or societies where
people were in charge.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But prior to Newton,
we had much more

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of a holistic view of ourselves
in relation to the cosmos.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Newton really essentially
ripped us out of that

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and created a world
of individual things,

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:90%
and really defined thingness.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it became a real
understanding of ours

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that we end with the hair
on our skin, at which point

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the universe begins.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And that, you know,
it's hard to understand

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
how much that
definition of ourselves

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
really informs how we operate,
because not all cultures do.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Many indigenous cultures
think very differently.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
They think of themselves
as being all connected.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.345 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they create a
very different kind of society.

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.436 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics,
in this sense.

00:12:39.436 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Really, when you
started doing research

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
for this book, where else can
you go but quantum physics

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to look for
innate interconnectedness.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And you really, I think you
lay out the story very well.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into a
little bit about some

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of the physics of
entanglement behind this,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:90%
without doing the whole thing.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I've done a couple other
interviews on entanglement

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that people can go
to in the archives.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes of
setting this up right now,

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
let's do a little bit on it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.666 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: OK.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, fundamentally, I mean our
idea about subatomic particles

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
are, as physics class has shown
us, little billiard balls.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what we think of.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But actually, a subatomic
particle is not that.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrating packet of
energy, trading information

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and energy with other subatomic
particles and this background

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:90%
energy field.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So a subatomic particle is
essentially a shape shifter.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you look down at
matter at that tiny level, what

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
you find is there's no
such thing as a thing.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The unit of the
universe isn't a thing.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a relationship.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the relationship between
those subatomic particles.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing, as you
said, about subatomic particles

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
is once they're in
contact, you can move one

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to New York and the
other one to Australia,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and they will continue to
be informed by each other.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.767 align:middle line:84%
Imagine they're twins
separated at birth.

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Even though they never
see each other again,

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
because they were in contact--
let's say they're boys.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They both marry a
woman called Jane.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
They both love the color blue.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And if one falls down
and breaks his leg,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the other one falls down
at the exact same moment

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.035 align:middle line:84%
and breaks his leg too,
even though he's just

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
sitting there sipping
a latte in Starbucks.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's what a subatomic--
that's what entanglement

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:90%
is essentially.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly being
affected by each other

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:90%
over any time and any distance.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this isn't
just in the human population.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We have, I believe,
Clive Backster, right.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:90%
We have his work.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it Clive or Cleve?

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Cleve.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cleve.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.143 align:middle line:84%
I always forget whether
it's Cleve or Clive.

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
His work with plants
and the same thing.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The fields effect on plants
on an emotional level,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
plants responding to emotion.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We also have the work
by Rupert Sheldrake

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.502 align:middle line:84%
about dogs who know when
their owners are coming home.

00:14:57.502 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you start
factoring in both non-locality

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and the whole idea of
a quantum energy field,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
then that is a
wonderful, neat metaphor

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to understand things
that-- connections

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that occur between people or
between people and other living

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
things like plants across
time and across space.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.045 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense only
by factoring in a field.

00:15:22.045 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And in your book, there's a
couple of really cute bits

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
where you talk about
your dog, Ollie.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would
love to meet Ollie.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:84%
He sounds like quite a
character, a curmudgeon on one

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
hand and in another,
very generous.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, Ollie is--
Ollie was also an inspiration.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
He, by the way, has gone on
to the kennel into the sky.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aw, when
did that happen?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.573 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: I know.

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Just last September, sadly.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
He was a darling.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%
He was a total character.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
He's a Cavalier, King Ch-- he
was a Cavalier King Charles

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Spaniel.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were bred
by royal decree.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And consequently,
a lot of that breed

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%
are extremely sort of haughty.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They're very regal.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And Ollie was the
exception to the rule

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of dogs that know
when their owners come home.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Ollie knew when we were coming
home and could care less.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But Ollie was really
interesting for me,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because even though he didn't
have much time for humans,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Ollie was kind to
every dog on his walk.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And I watched him with our
next door neighbor, T-Bone,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
who is a little girl
Affenpinscher, tiny little dog,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.590 align:middle line:90%
even smaller than him.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Ollie used to dig
holes under our fence

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and stick bones under
there for T-Bone.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And when she came over, he
would raid our garbage bin

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to find a chicken
carcass for her.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And he would let her
have his food first.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And he would roll
over and let her

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
win when they were
rough housing, just

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:90%
to keep her in the game.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And I kept looking
at this and saying,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
this isn't survival
of the fittest.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:90%
This isn't dog-eat-dog.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing dog-eat-dog
about Ollie's world.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
You know he's a very
cooperative entity.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that also started me
thinking was Darwin right?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.657 align:middle line:84%
And again, the answer is,
overwhelmingly, he wasn't.

00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He wasn't.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.031 align:middle line:84%
And OK, you say he could care
less when people came home.

00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But he did care if you
picked up his leash

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
or even thought about
his leash, right.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
He was ready to go
if it was a walk.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He caught
the field on that one.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
He was just not interested
in the rest of it.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
You just said something a
moment ago about Darwin.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I've read some
various analysis of his work

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
in the later part of his life.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of it has
indicated-- most of it

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
has indicated that he actually
had a change of heart.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
He was under the influence
of another academic early

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
in his life, and
he started buying

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:84%
into this concept of
competition and life is war.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.884 align:middle line:90%
That's not where he ended up.

00:17:50.884 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: No.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He became much more aware of
and appreciative of cooperation

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:90%
later in his life.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But early in-- he was
a man of his time.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And the time, at the time,
there was a lot of worry

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
about population
explosion and the idea

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't
enough to go around.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And he started thinking
about that and thought, yes.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Life must proceed and
evolve through struggle.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It must be a race
to the finish line.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:90%
And that really informed him.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.886 align:middle line:84%
He never actually came
up with the term survival

00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:90%
of the fittest.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:90%
That was a friend of his.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.375 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: But
his ideas really

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:84%
swept the globe, thanks to
the advent of mass printing.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's impossible to
over-appreciate Darwin's effect

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:90%
on so many areas of society.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
He really became a
justifying principle

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
for burgeoning industrial
capitalism, you know.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
He became a justifying
principle for colonialism,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
one race taking over
another for its own good.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:84%
He became a justifying principle
for sociopathic behavior.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Hitler loved Darwin.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
just-- and that really

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
became our defining
model in a lot of ways

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
for our modern society.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, I will give
you an example of cooperation.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the other extreme.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
My son went to the Waldorf
School in Sacramento

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and had this wonderful
teacher named Mr. Murray.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.572 align:middle line:90%
And you know the Waldorf system?

00:19:22.572 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Very well.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.299 align:middle line:84%
And so the children have to
have direct communication

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and relationship
with their teachers.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You shake hands going
in in the morning.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
You shake hands going out.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that Mr.
Murray did with the class,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
first through eighth,
those eight years

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
they're together, and--
is that he encouraged

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
them to help each
other, even on tests.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
with everything.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
His feeling was if
you're lagging behind,

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
then have someone who
understands the subject well

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
help you out so
that everyone can

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:90%
thrive within the classroom.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And watching what
happened over the years

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
with that group of
individuals was amazing.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of them are quite
successful in their own right

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:84%
at each of the different, widely
varied things they're doing.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But this is an example
where competition would not

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:90%
have helped that group.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: No, and
the studies looking

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
at everything from
education to business models

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate that competition is
a dangerous and outmoded model

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:90%
in many areas of our society.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Studies looking at students,
where A students are working

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.090 align:middle line:84%
side by side with
C students, find

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that both the A students
and the C students

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
do better by working together,
rather than being streamed

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and pitted against each
other competitively.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Business-wise, the same thing.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to Jack
Canfield recently,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling me about how
one company he went to work for

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
had this very-- they had little
silos of groups of people

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
within the organization working
competitively with each other.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And this created such
a climate of fear

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
that it inhibited
innovation, compared

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to their rival,
another company which

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
had the team work together as
the whole, the organization

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
worked together
as a whole, and be

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.404 align:middle line:90%
rewarded as a whole for success.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very discreet of
you not to mention names.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Very well known, very
large corporations.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very interesting
experience and observation

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.579 align:middle line:90%
on his part.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:90%
And of course, you can feel it.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
When you have that fear going,
creativity simply cannot

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
thrive.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
extreme fear going on,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
you get something that
looks like Columbine.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote about this
a little bit in your book.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The t-shirt
on one of the shooters.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.541 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well,
this is the thing.

00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, sociopathic behavior
looks to Darwinian stuff.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
There are big websites
now that are all

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
about culling the population
of the lesser mortals.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.281 align:middle line:84%
And of the two shooters who
walked into Columbine High

00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and started blowing away
their classmates, one of them

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
was wearing a t-shirt that
said, "natural selection."

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's the extremes to
which this idea goes to.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was, you know,
it happened at the time

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:90%
with Darwin.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a great deal of
eugenics and that whole idea

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
of getting rid of
the sub normal.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was now justified.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
There was a justifying
principle for it.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very sad but true.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk, again going back
to pop culture and the movie,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:84%
"A Beautiful Mind," John Nash,
who the movie was based on,

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
a real character in life,
played by Russell Crowe.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
scene where he laid out

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.310 align:middle line:84%
a case mathematically for
cooperation versus competition,

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
when all of the guys
were essentially

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
lusting after a blonde
girl who was surrounded

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.534 align:middle line:90%
by her brunette girlfriends.

00:22:58.534 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: OK.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, this iconic
scene in that movie

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
has to do with-- you know, Nash
is a post graduate student,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and he's there with his
economist student friends.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the bar, and
a blonde and her friends,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:90%
her brunette friends, walk in.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And the boys are all sort of
deciding, saying, OK guys.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
As Adam Smith says, we
do best for everyone

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:84%
by looking after
number one, you know.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It's every man for himself here.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And Nash sort of is
shaking his head.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And he finally says, no.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if we all
go for the blonde,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:90%
we're going to block each other.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And no one will get her.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we go to
her friends then,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
they won't want
anything to do with us

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
because no one wants
to be second best.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So what if no one
goes for the blonde,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.941 align:middle line:90%
and we all go to her friends.

00:23:47.941 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the only way
we're going to have a date.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.861 align:middle line:90%
This is the only way we all win.

00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts
thinking about it

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, you know,
Adam Smith, what he said

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:90%
was incomplete.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
individual does best

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:90%
by looking after number one.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The individual does best, the
best response to any situation

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is what's best for the
individual and the group.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:90%
And with that, he walks out.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
He says, Adam Smith was wrong.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, governing dynamics,
runs out, and thanks the blonde

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.514 align:middle line:84%
for being the muse to
the theory that ended up

00:24:20.514 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:90%
winning him the Nobel Prize.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.554 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:22.554 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Very practical.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But a beautiful mind to be able
to put those pieces together

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:90%
for us now.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And you have woven this
together with its impact

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
not just on whether you
get the babe or not,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
but also onto our physical
health, our relationships

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
with each other, our
families, and so forth.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.814 align:middle line:84%
And just before--
we're going to take

00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:90%
a break in a couple minutes.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But before that, let's
introduce the subject

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of Japanese individuals, the
Japanese culture, and heart

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I find it fascinating.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, you know
what's really interesting.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have this
idea that the whole idea

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of the individual being
that what's best for us

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is really promoting our own
life, and our own needs,

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
and looking out for number one.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But studies of the
Japanese have found

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
something really fascinating.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Epidemiologists, people
who look at populations,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:84%
have looked at what happens to
the Japanese when they move.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the Japanese are
a really strange culture.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They smoke like chimneys, but
they don't have heart disease.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: So-- except
when they come to the US.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
get heart disease

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that mimics just like the
rest of the population.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So these scientists
started studying this.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
among those who

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't get heart disease, even
though they moved to America--

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:90%
it was really fascinating.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It had nothing to do with diet.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.315 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter whether they
ate a Big Mac and fries or tofu

00:25:54.315 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and sushi.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
What mattered, the only
thing that mattered,

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
was whether or not they
kept close social groups

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that they had similar to what
they had in the old country.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: So
these scientists,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
these epidemiologists,
traveled to Japan

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.735 align:middle line:90%
to try to find the X factor.

00:26:12.735 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, what was the
missing X factor of health?

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Why would that be a
buffer to ill health.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Japanese looked
at them and said well,

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to tell.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
You Americans, you're so lonely.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
You even walk down
the street alone.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can see that.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And that really
was a fascinating thing for me,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
looking at the whole
need we have to belong.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.165 align:middle line:84%
Because scientists looking
at the opposite side, people

00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
who commit suicide,
find that suicides

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:84%
suffer from what
psychologists say--

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.527 align:middle line:90%
call excessive individuation.

00:26:52.527 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: They feel left out.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And being left out is the one
thing that human beings cannot

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
bear.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.961 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We cannot bear.

00:26:59.961 --> 00:27:01.334 align:middle line:90%
We suffer in all ways from that.

00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to come
back in just a minute.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.666 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to talk about some

00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
suffer the most

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
extreme individuation.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:28.752 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Just before we broke, we
were talking about suicides,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was explaining
that you would probably

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
be surprised to find out
where some of the highest

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.304 align:middle line:90%
rates of suicides were.

00:27:38.304 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: A
group of scientists

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
got together with people looking
at the population and differing

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.056 align:middle line:90%
populations.

00:27:46.056 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted
to find out where

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the most suicides
occurred in America.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And they assumed it would be
in the poorest neighborhoods.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
So they looked.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And they did find that the most
suicides occur in the poorest

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:90%
neighborhoods.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Then they wanted
to find out where's

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
the next group of suicides.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't the next poorest.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It was actually in the
richest neighborhoods.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Richest neighborhoods in America
had the second highest rate

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:90%
of suicide.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
when they started

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:84%
looking why was that
it was the people who

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
made just a little bit less
than everybody else around them.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And that, again to
these scientists,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
was another indication of
this lack of belonging,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.605 align:middle line:84%
people feeling like
financial outcasts.

00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:32.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And that becomes
something they can't bear.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.463 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and when you're
in that kind of social strata,

00:28:37.463 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:84%
there's so much fear surrounding
not being able to keep up

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.529 align:middle line:84%
or being perceived as
slightly less than.

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it creates
tremendous amounts

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:90%
of fear in these individuals.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.793 align:middle line:84%
And of course, a lot
of these suicides

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that make
it to the evening news.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's not as
though we're not aware of it.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But as they say, it's
lonely at the top.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean if you call that
the top, it's lonely indeed.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought you made
a lovely case for that.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was another area
having to do with wealth.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually they're using MRIs
in brain activity, brain wave

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:90%
activity, about fairness issues.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
several examples of games

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and such, and studies, and
experiments around this.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that intrigued me

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:84%
was how the MRI
operated when you

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
had a wealthy, well off
individual, when they were

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
able to give some of what
they have to someone they

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
love, to their partner
or so, and what

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.210 align:middle line:84%
happened to their
brain activity.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
when someone that

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:84%
was on the lowest part of
the socioeconomic scale

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
was given what they felt
they were worth and due.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Very similar brain
activity, and this

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
had to do-- this
was interesting,

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
because it had to
do with what's fair

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and our perceptions on a very
deep level of what's fair.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.264 align:middle line:84%
We're not living
in a fair culture.

00:29:55.264 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: No.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.614 align:middle line:84%
And scientists, as you say,
have discovered two things

00:29:59.614 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
that you talked about.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
One is the idea of giving
feels as good to us

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:90%
as eating or having sex.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're told
we're born to be selfish.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We're told even our
genes are selfish.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, listen to
Richard Dawkins, right.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we're
supposed to act selfishly

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
programmed to do so.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
the science shows not.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:84%
The science shows
that we feel as

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:84%
good about giving as
eating and having sex.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, there's also
another thing in our brains

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that's an it's not fair
button that goes off

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
when we're not given enough, or
even when we're given too much.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Our brains scream,
it's not fair.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So even those bankers out there.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
There's something in their
brains that's saying,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
it's not fair.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
We're being given too much.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, there's
an equalizing mechanism.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So studies that
have shown when, you

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
know, where they've sort
of stacked the deck,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.140 align:middle line:84%
where somebody's getting
too much and another person

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:84%
is getting too
little in the study.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's an
employment type game.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:84%
They find that people feel
better when-- if they're

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
getting too much, if they
get less the next time.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not given
enough, if they're given more.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So we feel good
about equalizing.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It's there in our hard
wiring to feel good.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
we're seeking balance

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
on a psychospiritual,
emotional level.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there was an actual
game, the ultimatum game.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well,
this is a wonderful way

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
of showing that we're
inherently fear.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The ultimatum game's the
simplest kind of game.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And John Nash was the person
who came up with game theory.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:90%
So these follow on.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It the ultimatum game, let's
say you and I have never met.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm given 10 bucks.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
You're assigned to
me as my partner.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going
to meet you again.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told I can
take this 10 bucks,

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and I can split it with
you in any way I want.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I split it with you, if
you decide to keep the split,

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.350 align:middle line:84%
then we both get our
share of the money.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
If you say no to it, neither
of us gets any money.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption is
that I will always

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:90%
keep $9, or something like that.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you about $1.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's
derisory, you'll

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:84%
take it because something's
better than nothing.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, this game has been
played all around the world,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:84%
even with cultures that don't
have money, where they're

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:90%
playing with tobacco, not money.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.457 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
split is 50%.

00:32:33.457 --> 00:32:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense to me.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: The most
common split is 50%.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But the other interesting
thing is about fairness,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is we expect people
to be fair back.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:90%
We expect reciprocity.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And scientists have
shown this with a thing

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:90%
called the public goods game.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now in this game, let's say
we've got a group of us.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:90%
We're all given 10 bucks.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We're all told to put a certain
percentage of that money

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:90%
into a pot.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
redistributed to all of us.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So the real secret to the game
is the more everybody puts in,

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:90%
the better everybody makes out.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And initially, it's true.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is generous
usually, except maybe one

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.460 align:middle line:84%
or two people who
are less generous.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.887 align:middle line:84%
So this pisses the
rest of the people off.

00:33:21.887 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.527 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: So in subsequent
games, they put in less.

00:33:25.527 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:90%
And they put in less after that.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.642 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we start becoming
stingier ourselves in response,

00:33:29.642 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:84%
because we're feeling this
lack of fairness innately.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.058 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Exactly, Regina.

00:33:33.058 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, no
one puts in anything.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
where we are right now.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would say so.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: We're
in a public goods

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:90%
game no one wants to play.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was another one,
a woman named Browning.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The study she did I
found interesting,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
computer generated model,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:90%
from what I understood.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: No, this
used one of those games.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was trying
to figure out what

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.342 align:middle line:84%
was going to be--
in this game, it

00:33:59.342 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
was almost like a survival
of the fittest game.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
was they modeled it

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
so that the winners of any
game, of any couple of games,

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
would then split their
binary code and make a baby.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And I so that super
winner would then

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.730 align:middle line:90%
play other codes, essentially.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:84%
And what they found,
which was so amazing--

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you want to give
the framework for the game

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:90%
itself?

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it about
the partnership.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
This particular one
was about a partnership

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:84%
where you could either--
you had four options.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.658 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to go-- if
they had a man and wife,

00:34:30.658 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the woman
chooses to go to the ballet.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The man chooses to go to
a bullfight, whatever.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%
You had a choice.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.805 align:middle line:84%
The woman could
accompany the man

00:34:39.805 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to his game, what he wants to
do, whether she wants or not.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
He could accompany
her to the ballet.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.482 align:middle line:90%
She could go to her own thing.

00:34:46.482 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Or they could each go to the
other thing without the other,

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.381 align:middle line:84%
And so those are the
four variables in that.

00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And it was called
the Battle of the Sexes game.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They always have these
really funny, exotic titles.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So she modeled it.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.320 align:middle line:84%
As I say, the winners
of the different games

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:90%
would then make a baby.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And then those super winners
would play each other.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
she modeled it.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.297 align:middle line:84%
And with computer
programming, you could play--

00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Endlessly.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Thousands of
these games very quickly.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
She called up her thesis tutor
and said, oh my goodness.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.420 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be taking turns.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So the computer
model itself found

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that cooperation was
the best outcome,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that when you took turns, when
you were fair and reciprocated,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:90%
you actually won better.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it makes sense,
just like the other one,

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:84%
like the ultimatum
experiment where you can--

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:84%
everyone ended up
essentially giving

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:90%
each other half their money.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And that feels right.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I find even in simple
situations such as playing games

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.780 align:middle line:84%
with friends, board
games, or card games.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's fun to be in a bit of
competition, so to speak,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and doing your best.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But I can't stand it if it gets
lopsided and anybody is clearly

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.995 align:middle line:90%
not winning.

00:35:58.995 --> 00:35:59.745 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:35:59.745 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
like the game anymore.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: I mean,
we all have that in us.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We will have-- and
here's the reason

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.330 align:middle line:84%
that it's so important, aside
from just it being the kind

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and the right thing to do.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, scientists
have demonstrated

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that the more
unfair any society,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and they've looked at all
of the Western societies,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the more fair--
and by unfair, they

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.850 align:middle line:84%
mean really a huge
disparity between income

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.400 align:middle line:84%
between rich and poor and a
disparity between opportunity.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:84%
The more unfair any society,
the worse off that society

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is in terms of all the
important social indicators

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
like education, crime,
health, mental health, all

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And America, which was worked
out to be the most unfair

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of all of the Western
societies, when they looked

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
at all those social indicators,
they found we're at the bottom.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:84%
We, the richest country in the
world, we're at the bottom.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We've got the worst
stats for education,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:84%
for health, et
cetera-- on and on.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And we're the most unfair.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So they've made that connection.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And a real interesting
one I found

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:84%
was one state that had
the fewest problems in all

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
was New Hampshire.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.004 align:middle line:84%
And they also found
that is the least unfair

00:37:23.004 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:90%
of all of the states--

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: In terms
of this disparity

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
between-- great disparity
between rich and poor

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and opportunity.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So fairness creates a better
situation for everybody,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.412 align:middle line:90%
rich or poor.

00:37:36.412 --> 00:37:36.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:36.995 --> 00:37:40.171 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: You know, there's--
the one really interesting--

00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're not talking
communism or socialism here.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about an innate,
almost cellular knowing

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:90%
of fairness.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.491 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this has a really
important bearing on the rich,

00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a study
that I've looked at that

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I found really
fascinating of rich folks.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.481 align:middle line:84%
They found-- they
looked at neighborhoods.

00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
find out who were

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the people who
were the most ill.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And they found
they were the rich.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
The richest person on any
block is the most ill,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
because they found
that person had created

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
a bunker mentality,
an isolated mentality.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was that isolation
that ultimately made him ill.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.687 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, that
Gary Cooper character

00:38:21.687 --> 00:38:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect candidate
for a heart attack,

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
because they found
this lack of belonging,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
which is all about--
belonging is about connecting,

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:84%
about giving, about agreeing,
about being part of,

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:90%
about fairness.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, belonging is probably
the best drug we can take.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It not only protects us
against heart attack,

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
but also stroke,
even the common cold.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they found looking
at heart attack patients

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that only half have
the usual risk factors.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.392 align:middle line:84%
The other half
are simply lonely.

00:38:56.392 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in the past,
the statistics,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the
United States, were

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that men had a much higher
degree of heart disease,

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.700 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.632 align:middle line:84%
Now the women have
caught up with that.

00:39:06.632 --> 00:39:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Hmm.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, women are working
all hours, trying

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to juggle all sorts
of things, don't

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.631 align:middle line:84%
have the social networks
they used to have.

00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And so it's about belonging.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is about belonging.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you talked in
the book about, again,

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
this essential
knowingness, the wisdom

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:84%
of a group of people
for its own survival.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the case you
used, it was a hill tribe

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
around the tsunami
of 2004, which

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought was fascinating, the
way in which the elder started

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.420 align:middle line:84%
observing and noticing
the patterns of behavior.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can share
the rest of that.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, one of the
things I wanted to look at

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:90%
was how do we recover this bond.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I haven't really
defined bond in this show

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.080 align:middle line:90%
so far.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But by bond, I mean connections
so integral and profound

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that it's impossible
to say where

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
one thing ends and
another thing begins.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what my book argues,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.540 align:middle line:90%
is that's what we are part of.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
We are an intergalactic
super-organism.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can only understand
each other and our lives

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:90%
if we live in that way.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself,
how do we recover it?

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And there were four things
I thought were important.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The first was about seeing
much more holistically.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the 2004 tsunami where
a quarter million people died,

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:84%
four tribes watched the whole
thing from a mountaintop.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Westerners
were amazed by this.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.480 align:middle line:84%
If they had been
able to forecast

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.390 align:middle line:84%
this what their Western,
the best Western equipment

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:41.230 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do, and when they
actually looked at why

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and they talked to these elders,
they said, how did you know?

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And they said oh, simple.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The fish were
swimming a bit funny,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and the animals were
acting a little bit odd.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the wind
had changed direction.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And so we--

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The children
were behaving badly.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The children were
behaving badly.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we realized that
water was going to pull back

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and hurl forward with fury.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.719 align:middle line:90%
And so that was amazing to them.

00:41:07.719 --> 00:41:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they looked
further at this tribe,

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:84%
they found they've
actually learned

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
to see in a very,
very different way.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can
swim in the water,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
distinguish little brown clams

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
from little brown stones 15
yards away in the ocean bottom

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.980 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of
swimming aids like goggles.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They've taught
themselves, their eyes,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.420 align:middle line:84%
to be almost like
a camera aperture.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able to see so
much more holistically, so much

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
more detail, than
we in the West can.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And that really has to do
with how we're trained to see.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We are trained to
be so individual.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:84%
We're trained, if
you're as old as I am,

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.740 align:middle line:84%
you remember books like
"Fun With Dick and Jane."

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: And you know.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were taught
to see the comings

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and goings of individuals.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, we focus on
the individual things so much

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot see these subtle
connections that tie things

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this seems
to be one differentiating

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
factor socially between
many of the eastern cultures

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and the west, is this sense
of belonging and family.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:90%
But even that is changing.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Thailand, I
was there a few years ago,

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and we were with some
students, American students.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
some work in the field

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:90%
of science and sociology.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about the fact

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.165 align:middle line:84%
that there was a huge
upswing in the prescription

00:42:34.165 --> 00:42:37.820 align:middle line:84%
of antidepressant drugs
to the elder generation.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The reason being, they
now have Starbucks,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:90%
or their Wawee coffee.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And you saw the young
people in their 30s.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:90%
They had Western clothing on.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They had their Mac books
there at the coffee shops.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And the children were
leaving the hill.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They were leaving the cities
to go find their own way,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:90%
as we have done for so long.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And the family does not know how
to survive without each other

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:84%
there and were rapidly falling
into a state of depression

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.460 align:middle line:84%
among the elderly,
which is very, very sad.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, they already had
that part of the picture,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.492 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like, right.

00:43:10.492 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how do
you stop any kind of,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.110 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it progress, change

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.570 align:middle line:84%
once a younger
generation has decided

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.050 align:middle line:90%
it's in their best interest.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: By showing
them that maybe it

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:90%
isn't the progress.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, there's
some wonderful happy mediums.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea that we have
is such an either or mentality

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:90%
here in the West.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.960 align:middle line:84%
We think it has to be communism
or socialism, or capitalism.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't see that there are
all kinds of shades of gray,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.570 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:84%
There all kinds of
ways to differentiate.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:90%
We can have progress.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:90%
We can have Western mod cons.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.390 align:middle line:90%
But we can also have community.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's really my message.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The message of "The
Bond" is the only way

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
we are going to evolve as
a society, as a species,

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is to understand
that we are here--

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.030 align:middle line:84%
we are interconnected,
so interconnected,

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to
live in that way.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to recreate the
kinds of close knit community

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
that we are programmed
to thrive in.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same time, not
fall into only associating with

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
conundrum there.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.242 align:middle line:90%
We need each other.

00:44:24.242 --> 00:44:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet at
the same time, we

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:84%
cloister ourselves among
people only of like mind

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and are very intolerant
to outside perceptions

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:84%
within this attempt to
make ourselves feel safe.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
next piece of how

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to recover the bond I
wanted to talk about

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.940 align:middle line:84%
was this whole idea of
learning to relate to people

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:84%
in a different way, in a
much more holistic way.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:55.030 align:middle line:84%
That was the second thing I felt
was really important to wipe

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
out in that hard drive we have
to change in ourselves in order

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to evolve is we're taught and
we now look much more for us

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:90%
and revile them.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And us is becoming
smaller and smaller.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.767 align:middle line:84%
And them is becoming
bigger and bigger.

00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And
as you say, we look

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people
who are only like us.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind of almost
a personal justification.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:84%
We want our friends to be
another I, another person.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A reflection
of ourselves.

00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:28.515 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Exactly.

00:45:28.515 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know how
to connect with people

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.090 align:middle line:90%
who are not like us anymore.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly
see it in America.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.590 align:middle line:84%
We're polarizing so much
again on political grounds,

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:84%
on economic grounds, on
every kind of ground.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We are really dividing
and not understanding

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:84%
about bringing ourselves
together and making

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the relationship the
most important thing.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I found a really interesting
example of that in a guy

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.637 align:middle line:84%
called Orland Bishop, who's
working in Watts in California.

00:46:01.637 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.060 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.476 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: You
know, and here he

00:46:04.476 --> 00:46:07.450 align:middle line:84%
is working with gang
members, rival gang members,

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:84%
teaching the members of
the Crips and the Bloods,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.330 align:middle line:84%
the most notorious
gangs in America,

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
how you relate to each
other in wholeness.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Talk about a fool's errand.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.960 align:middle line:90%
But he's succeeding.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he's
teaching them methods

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
of getting past
those differences

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to connect on a
deeper soul level

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
by sharing deeply about
themselves and finding that,

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:84%
even though they have
differences of beliefs,

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.510 align:middle line:90%
they have common values.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he asked them
really probing questions

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to get them to open up
in front of each other,

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean deeply personal.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
something like what

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.200 align:middle line:84%
was the event that
essentially helped

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.250 align:middle line:84%
you come to the conclusion
your life was not going

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to be what you had
hoped it would be.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.734 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Exactly.

00:46:48.734 --> 00:46:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These interrupting,
often traumatic events.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
This really brought
out some, well,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:84%
vulnerability and
humility in these kids.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Exactly.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And that became the glue
that connected people.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of deep sharing
from the heart is so powerful.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's brought
together people

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.317 align:middle line:84%
who are very polarized, like
pro-life, pro-choice people.

00:47:11.317 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And also the story
of the old Germans

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.777 align:middle line:84%
that went back and revisited
their history in Belarus.

00:47:17.777 --> 00:47:18.860 align:middle line:90%
That was an amazing story.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: This
was an amazing story.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:84%
A batch of Germans
went back to Belarus

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to help with some of the
rebuilding after Chernobyl.

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And this had been-- these were
people who had been in the war.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So of course, they had been
on the side of the Nazis.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had created a
lot of destruction there.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
try to make amends.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:90%
So they were doing that.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.666 align:middle line:84%
And they were with
their host one night.

00:47:45.666 --> 00:47:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the old Germans
stood up and he said,

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.020 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to toast his host.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I wanted to say
this must never happen again.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And he started talking.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.037 align:middle line:90%
And he just began to sob.

00:47:58.037 --> 00:48:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had spent
time in a Russian camp.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.578 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: He
had been in a camp.

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And he had felt
sorry for himself.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But he started just
thinking of the destruction

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.650 align:middle line:84%
his country had wreaked
on this country.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And he began to sob.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, an old
woman, an old Belarusian woman,

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.500 align:middle line:84%
came over and hugged
him and kissed him.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like that
expression of real sorrow

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and real repentance
and an opening up

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.870 align:middle line:84%
of really speaking
from the heart

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:33.790 align:middle line:84%
crosses and creates a
situation of forgiveness

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:34.985 align:middle line:90%
that nothing else can.

00:48:34.985 --> 00:48:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, when you're
in a competitive society like

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the societies of the West,
you don't-- you feel you have

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to protect your
turf at all costs,

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
especially your
internal emotional turf.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And so people, at all
costs, avoid that kind

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.840 align:middle line:84%
of really intimate
disclosure and weakness

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.070 align:middle line:90%
in front of others.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.481 align:middle line:90%
We have to let that go.

00:48:57.481 --> 00:48:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we do,
when we understand

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.590 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to agree,
but when you share,

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.020 align:middle line:90%
you make that connection.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a
wonderful situation

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.230 align:middle line:84%
of pro-life and
pro-choice women.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:13.390 align:middle line:84%
After some shootings
in Planned Parenthood,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the leaders of
both sides decided

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.810 align:middle line:90%
they had to come together.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And they began
meeting in secret.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And they learned
how to share deeply

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to stop demonizing the other
and to value the connection.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of a few years,
they held a press conference.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And the press, of course, said
to them, so who won the debate?

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:90%
And they said well, no one.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:84%
In the act of sharing so
deeply, we-- both sides

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:41.350 align:middle line:84%
felt more firmly in
what they believe.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they said oh,
it was a failure then.

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.430 align:middle line:90%
They said, no, no.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when there've been
threats on Planned Parenthood,

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.830 align:middle line:84%
it's been the
pro-life people who

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.490 align:middle line:90%
warned the pro-choice people.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But now, of course,
we go out together.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:90%
We party together.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:90%
We love each other.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:84%
We look after each
other's children.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We love each other.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's that, that
power of deep sharing,

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.959 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the bridge
across the fence.

00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now with the
time we have remaining,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.830 align:middle line:84%
we need to start looking at the
how to, the mechanics of it,

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:11.537 align:middle line:90%
the solutions.

00:50:11.537 --> 00:50:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the last part
of your book is really

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.520 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to this.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take
your lead on this.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
lot to go through

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.280 align:middle line:90%
in a short amount of time.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But how do we
begin, first of all,

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:84%
creating this larger vision
of wholeness and this dialogue

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that brings us into this deep
compassion for one another,

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.514 align:middle line:84%
so we can even begin to reform
the society on this level.

00:50:34.514 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: OK.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are four things
that we need to do, I feel.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.810 align:middle line:84%
All of us, even the
most spiritual of us,

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:84%
have this hard drive
that's been programmed

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.670 align:middle line:84%
with I win, you
lose individualism,

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:48.810 align:middle line:90%
individualistic competitiveness.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.700 align:middle line:90%
That has to be wiped clean.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The first thing has
to be this whole idea

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of seeing much
more holistically.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I
talk a lot about-- I

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
provide a whole bunch of
exercises to show people

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:05.470 align:middle line:84%
how to learn to
see on many levels,

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:84%
seeing with the gut
hunch, seeing the unseen,

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.730 align:middle line:84%
seeing watching
people on many levels,

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.640 align:middle line:84%
seeing without
judgment, understanding.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.140 align:middle line:84%
As I write in the
book about Don Beck,

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:84%
who invented spiral dynamics,
and who has been very much

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.130 align:middle line:90%
involved as a peace keeper.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:84%
He helped both the black
people and the white people

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.080 align:middle line:84%
before the end of
apartheid in South Africa

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.740 align:middle line:84%
by showing the white
people, for instance,

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that the tribes
were not all alike,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that there were lots of
different shades of gray,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that there were lots of
different shades of belief.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that-- being
able to see that

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and to see with much more
detail about other people,

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and to distinguish different
belief systems, is important.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So there are many things, as I
say, I have on just exercises,

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:84%
learning to see the
whole that are important.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Learning to relate very
differently, that's number two.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:11.080 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little bit about
sharing deeply, understanding

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and valuing, because
we've lost this a lot.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of changing
what a relationship is for.

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:22.820 align:middle line:84%
A relationship is
about the connection.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not about agreeing.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not about finding
another I in that person.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.370 align:middle line:90%
It's about connection.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of exercises
in the book about how

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.160 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people
who are not like you,

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:84%
how to value that connection
above anything else,

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and how to learn to find
the connection, even

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:45.900 align:middle line:84%
among all of this other belief
stuff that's so different.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Republican, you
can find common values even

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.130 align:middle line:90%
in somebody who's a Democrat.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.580 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's a rabid
Republican and somebody's

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:00.100 align:middle line:84%
a rabid Democrat,
I guarantee you,

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.330 align:middle line:84%
you still have mostly
the same beliefs.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You have mostly the same values.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You still love
God, in most cases.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You still love your
family and children.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You still want to fix the roads
and fix the infrastructure.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And you still want to
balance the budget.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:90%
We have lots of similar things.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's training yourself
to find those common values

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.700 align:middle line:84%
underneath the different
beliefs and systems.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.050 align:middle line:90%
So getting past that.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:37.310 align:middle line:84%
The third thing I talk
about is really important,

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of the
superordinate goal.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And by that, that's a big word
for meaning coming together

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.190 align:middle line:90%
for a common goal.

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: It was
illustrated so perfectly

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in a study called the Robber's
Cave Experiment, where

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.660 align:middle line:84%
scientists took a bunch
of 12-year-old boys,

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
put them in two buses,
sent them to summer camp,

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and had them create identities
for themselves, separate places

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, and engaged them
in highly competitive games.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And the camp
counselors in this case

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:10.850 align:middle line:84%
were all psychologists
in disguise.

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And the kids, after a while,
were killing each other.

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:15.487 align:middle line:84%
They were ripping up
each other's flags.

00:54:15.487 --> 00:54:16.820 align:middle line:90%
They were beating each other up.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.020 align:middle line:90%
They hated each other.

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So then the counselors
got them together

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to work together for
some common goals.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They created a series
of crises in the camp.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Put an impediment
in the water supply.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Boys had to work together
to get rid of it.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Truck in the ditch, had to work
together to get rid of th--

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:90%
bring it out of the ditch.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
miracles happened.

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:39.050 align:middle line:84%
The boys began to eat
together, chat together,

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:90%
befriend each other.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of this
session, this summer camp,

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:49.000 align:middle line:84%
they unanimously voted to
ride home on the bus together.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.750 align:middle line:84%
What he really talked about, the
psychologist and the scientist

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:84%
who did the study,
invented this whole idea

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.950 align:middle line:84%
of superordinate
goal, coming together

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:01.230 align:middle line:84%
for a common goal,
barn building.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: That is such a
powerful thing in a community,

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
coming together to work
together for a common goal.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when people work
together for a common goal,

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.220 align:middle line:84%
their brain waves start
working in synchrony.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.830 align:middle line:90%
We start resonating as one.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I'm working
on a lot in little groups,

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.720 align:middle line:84%
intention groups, watching how
when people intend together,

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:90%
a group of eight or 12.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I call it the power of eight.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.460 align:middle line:84%
They begin resonating
in synchrony.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Not only does the person seem
to get better that they're

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.070 align:middle line:84%
sending intention to, but all
of the people in the group

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.020 align:middle line:90%
become a virtuous circle.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.050 align:middle line:84%
They also find they
are feeling better.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.130 align:middle line:90%
They feel more connected.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, they are
also healed in some way.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're permanently
changed, because they

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.317 align:middle line:84%
feel this connection, this
palpable sense of oneness.

00:55:55.317 --> 00:55:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all about, as you say,
it's the connection itself.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was a wonderful
metaphor about music being more

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.160 align:middle line:84%
about the space
between the notes.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same with us.

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's that connectivity
between the individuals

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.670 align:middle line:90%
that makes life worth living.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
few seconds left.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.960 align:middle line:84%
If you have any one
final comment to make,

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to hear it.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Really
important to understand, now

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're so frightened
about what's going on,

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.450 align:middle line:84%
is that you can be
the change agent.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:27.210 align:middle line:84%
In "The Bond," I
talk a lot about how

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.640 align:middle line:84%
tiny actions, even leaving
your change in a Coke machine,

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.280 align:middle line:84%
which one woman did, changed the
whole culture of her business.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It reminded her
company of generosity.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And when generosity
is the currency,

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.914 align:middle line:90%
the game starts changing.

00:56:43.914 --> 00:56:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, Lynne.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with us.

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, she's
made a beautiful case

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.930 align:middle line:90%
for choosing cooperation.

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
reading "The Bond."

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:54.840 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
