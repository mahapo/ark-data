00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Today I am joined by Angel
Communicator Doreen Virtue,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:90%
in her hometown of Maui, Hawaii.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very special
show, because the messages

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that Doreen has been
receiving from her angels

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
have been more intense
over the years,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted her to come
back on to learn more

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
about this divine
communication and how

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%
it can help us in our lives.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only does Doreen have
a Ph.D. in psychology

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.815 align:middle line:84%
and is a lifelong
clairvoyant, she

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:42.907 align:middle line:84%
is one of Hay House's
most popular authors.

00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
She's appeared on
"Oprah," "The View,"

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
"CNN," and she's joining us
here today to talk about some

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
of her latest communication
from the divine.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREEN VIRTUE: Well, aloha.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.644 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aloha.

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:55.435 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you
for coming out to Maui.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We really appreciate
you being here.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.332 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's been wonderful.

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have so much to share
about the magic of the island

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, it
truly is magical.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.905 align:middle line:90%
And healing.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:90%
A deeply healing place.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We are here by
Black Rock, in Kanapali.

00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:10.616 align:middle line:84%
And what is the significance of
that-- of the Black Rock here?

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.365 align:middle line:84%
You said that it's a
very significant part

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:90%
of the island--

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, the
lava, of course,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of the magnetic, and
the yin and the yang energy,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
When you have the flow of the
ocean connected with the rock

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
there, you get the
yin and the yang,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and so it's very
powerful for balancing.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
For releasing.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's a
very sacred place,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
where there's been cliff
diving forever, and still is.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is a-- this is
one of my favorite places

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
to go swimming, too, because
there's rich sea life here.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.281 align:middle line:84%
There's always honu,
or turtles, here--

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big sea turtles, yes--

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Beautiful sea turtles.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And monk seals are here,
lots of spotted eagle

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.527 align:middle line:90%
rays-- just beautiful.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like an aquarium out there.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.151 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely beautiful.

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you moved
here how long ago?

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I moved from
Laguna Beach, California

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
to the big island of
Hawaii-- Kona-- in 2006.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'd lived there until
what's called the "vog"--

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:90%
volcano fog-- chased me out.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Kilauea has 13 vents
open right now,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and so it's like-- it's
like being in San Francisco

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:90%
on a foggy day.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.529 align:middle line:90%
Or London.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly foggy.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.153 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You don't
see the sun there.

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I hopped over from
the big island to Maui,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's still
some of that here--

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the volcano fog-- but
nothing like Kona.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's nice to be
back in the sunshine.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And it really is a very
high vibrational place here.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When you go around Maui,
there's this sense of happiness.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aloha, of course,
means-- it means love,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:84%
it means breath, and you
really get that aloha spirit,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
for the most part, here.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.355 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no place is
perfect, but this is--

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
having traveled around
the world a few times,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.355 align:middle line:90%
this is pretty darn close--

00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why did you--

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --to being perfect.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.044 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --yeah, choose Maui,
after being around the world

00:02:51.044 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:90%
several times?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And I
was looking, too.

00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Australia was
definitely in the running.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I like Australia a lot,
especially the Queensland side.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
But I do like being in America.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I like the American culture,
having been raised in that.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
What I love about Maui is
there's a sense of slowness.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.402 align:middle line:84%
And also, having been raised
in Southern California, where--

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
as you know, because you're
from Southern California,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
too-- that pressure to
compete, and go faster,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's a Starbucks
on every corner,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has to drive a
German-- this year's model car.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And you must have
the latest purse.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Or you just don't fit in.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the opposite here.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Here, if you have a fancy
car or you dress fancy,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:90%
you're labeled as a tourist.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Not that there's anything
wrong with being a tourist.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.436 align:middle line:84%
But you just--
when you live here,

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
be mistaken for one.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So here, everyone drives
Toyotas that are old.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You never get
dressed-- I mean, this

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.995 align:middle line:90%
is really dressed up to me.

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
When I wore this one to
the store, they were, like,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.911 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Are you going out?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So you wear-- you wear shorts,
you wear sundresses here.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to be
conscious of the material chase

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
You really can go within.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
about recognizing

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
people on that true
namaste level here.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Are they in integrity?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Are they peaceful?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Are they happy?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.936 align:middle line:90%
Are they walking their talk?

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Much more than what do they
drive, or what do they wear.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can tell.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.757 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a beautiful
transition for you.

00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's many
different things that

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:90%
have happened in your life.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Did all of this-- yes, I know,
the last time we saw you,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.857 align:middle line:90%
you were, you were blonde.

00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.226 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now this is back
to your natural color.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: This is
my natural color.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Although I have to admit, I'm
using a little natural coloring

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.165 align:middle line:90%
to fight the grey.

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It's ironic-- I spent so many
years fighting the brunette,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and now that I want the
brunette, it's like, no,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:90%
we want to be grey.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But, I think, Southern
California-- I

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
really got caught up
in that "fitting in."

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
California, you're blonde.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.005 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
lost myself a lot.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Although, it's fun-- I
mean, blondes do have fun--

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
but when I came here, I
just wanted to be real.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.715 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled off the
artificial nails.

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:90%
I had artificial eyelashes.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.662 align:middle line:90%
I pulled them off.

00:04:58.662 --> 00:04:59.995 align:middle line:90%
Got rid of the artificial color.

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, no spray tanning,
or Botox, or anything.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Just me.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So doing that on the outside
has helped me, on the inside,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:90%
to be more natural, too.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've also--
are a vegan, as well.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I've been
a vegan since 1996.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A long time.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.938 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah--
that was something

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
that I was told to do.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was a
pretty easy transition.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Fish took me a while, but
I gave up fish then, too,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and-- it's not for
everyone, to be a vegan.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:90%
But I'm 100% vegan.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't wear leather.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:90%
My purses aren't leather.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Just because, to me, that's one
way I can make a difference.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's not for everyone.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of those pushy
vegans, or judgmental vegans,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and, I mean, I eat
meals with people

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
who are sitting there
eating meat next to me,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and I don't even blink.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And my dogs eat meat.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- to each its own.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's the path of
gentleness and compassion.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I
did since I got here was,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.996 align:middle line:84%
I went through my
closet, and-- you've

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:90%
known me through the years.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like to shop,
and in traveling the world,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and going to these--

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Collect
different things--

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Collect
different things.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.466 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
is, I was getting

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:84%
really sensitive to any
kind of pain energy.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.952 align:middle line:84%
And that I could feel clothing
that was made in sweatshops.

00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And I could really feel
that, when it was on my body.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like--
like, this isn't right.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew--
I know too much.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so do you-- about where
these clothes are made--

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it blocking you
from receiving communications?

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It really was, yeah.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was about
getting in integrity.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.635 align:middle line:84%
So last year I went
through my whole closet,

00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and I got rid of everything
that was from a known sweatshop

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:90%
producer.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And that includes some
of the major designers.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go on
YouTube, you can find out

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
who's using sweatshops and not.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I either donated,
or sold, or in some way

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
got rid of all those clothes
and filled my closet up

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:90%
with organic clothes.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.049 align:middle line:84%
Homemade clothes that
I get on Etsy.com.

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:58.965 align:middle line:90%
Have you been on Etsy?

00:06:58.965 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's fabulous.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.633 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like going
to a giant crafts fair.

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:05.067 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And local
handmakers here as well.

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So just-- it's
basically women who

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
work-- they have their own
business, selling clothes.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel the difference.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.405 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely can
feel the love--

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --love, that comes
through the clothing--

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.086 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And the
irony is, it's cheaper

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:19.764 align:middle line:90%
than buying clothes at stores.

00:07:19.764 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
That's great news, and you're
supporting local business

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:90%
owners.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.615 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I also got my own
sewing machine, and--

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: A long time ago,
when my kids were little,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.756 align:middle line:90%
I used to sew their clothes.

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- it's one on my list
to get back into doing that.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I've done a little, and
put trim on clothes,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
but my dream is
to someday create

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
a line of beautiful
organic clothes.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.892 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of organic clothes
still looks like granola to me.

00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- I want
something that's

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
really fashionable and chic.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:90%
But fair trade.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
No sweatshops.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
No toxic dyes.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.875 align:middle line:84%
Organic fabrics--
real organic fabrics.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.434 align:middle line:90%
That's my dream.

00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you move
into this direction

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
because of communication that
you've been receiving lately?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
That I mentioned was intense,
for a little while there.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It was intense.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It happened-- there was--
it was about four years ago,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.984 align:middle line:90%
there was this Venus return.

00:08:14.984 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you remember
it, but it was in June.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was in Europe.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to drop
a name right now.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
She's an awesome woman.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%
The Princess of Norway.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I was at her house.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And she's really into angels.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:90%
She channels angels.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Teaches people about angels.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And writes
about it, too.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So she and I were
in her backyard

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
during the Venus return,
doing a ceremony.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like this
energy came at me.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And it said, you can't
hold back, Doreen,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
in telling people what you know.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, got it.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Because I had been--

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.921 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --getting messages
since I was a child.

00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
About, like, the
future of the world,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and, and what's in integrity,
and it seemed like every time

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I talked about it-- like,
when our president at the time

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
said he wanted to go into
Iraq, because there was weapons

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of mass destruction--
that night,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I was giving a talk
in San Francisco.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're real open-minded.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.171 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
everyone, he's lying.

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The angels tell me there are
no weapons of mass destruction.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And this was going down
right at that moment.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- and a couple
of people in the audience

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:90%
were freaking out.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:84%
They said, but he said
there's terrorists.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, they're not.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
This is all a cover up.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:90%
The angels told me the truth.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And some people walked out.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so sensitive
to that kind of thing.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.595 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, OK,
don't talk about that.

00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, in my newsletter, I
put kind of the same message.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of-- my son ran
my newsletter list at the time,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Mom,
people are cancelling.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk about this stuff.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And every time it seemed like I
could throw a little truth out

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
there, like I talk
about ETs, or, you know,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.339 align:middle line:84%
GMOs or something, people go,
no, no-- just stick to angels.

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's been hard
for me, because I'm

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
really sensitive to
criticism and rejection.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm honest about that.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Venus return
happened at the Princess'

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
house, and I was told
"just spit it out,"

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I started openly talking
about this to my audiences.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And the world had changed.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:90%
They were much more receptive.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, I got overboard.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I really went the other extreme.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It was like, blah,
blah, blah-- you know?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.123 align:middle line:84%
All these things I'd been
holding in for 20 years,

00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
like, I just kind of
regurgitated them.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.035 align:middle line:84%
But then I, I got to a balance
now, where if someone asks me,

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell them the absolute
truth about what the angel say,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
but I don't-- I think
it scares people.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not here
to scare anyone.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So I don't offer
it, unless they ask.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lot of people
in this-- on this network,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
are seeking truth.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Just like you are willing
to give that truth.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How can
you-- basically, what

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is the communication
that came down about some

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of these ETs, or
beings, and so forth,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that have come down
onto this planet now?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, how can we
protect against those?

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.724 align:middle line:90%
Because that's really important.

00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:51.014 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, it's-- we
don't need to protect against

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
the ETs.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.709 align:middle line:90%
They're helping us.

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a group
that is helping us.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
They-- well, it's-- they're
helping us because they love

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.077 align:middle line:84%
But it's mostly
because the impact

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that would happen
if anything happened

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.327 align:middle line:84%
to Earth-- it would have such a
ripple effect on our universe.

00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:08.035 align:middle line:84%
So they're protecting
their neighborhood,

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:09.197 align:middle line:90%
is what they're doing.

00:11:09.197 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And so they're watching over us.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.699 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
see the gyrations

00:11:12.699 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.865 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've told me--
the angels have told me--

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that, to the ETs, we're
like an immature baby here.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
They actually likened us
to a ster-- a teenager

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.131 align:middle line:90%
on steroids with a gun.

00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
With a loaded gun.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So we're
real combustible here,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:90%
in their eyes.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.405 align:middle line:90%
So they're just watching.

00:11:31.405 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:90%
They can see all this.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
They're, like-- so,
so I do talk to them.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I do talk to them, and I
ask them to watch over us,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.505 align:middle line:84%
and please help us, and
help our environment.

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I hear you say
that a lot-- watch over us,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.314 align:middle line:90%
watch over us.

00:11:45.314 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that they
give you in terms of a glimpse

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.282 align:middle line:84%
into the trajectory
of the future?

00:11:49.282 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, they
always have shown me

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.392 align:middle line:84%
that we have free will, and
there's forks in the road.

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:84%
One of things they've been
talking about the last two

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
or three years is that those
of us who are peace lovers

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
need to have a balance
with also being activists.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's really difficult
for those who meditate a lot,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and who love just to be in
that, kind of, bubble world,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the
bubble and say,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
ooh, this is going on--
I better get involved.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.197 align:middle line:90%
Without losing that peace.

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:16.655 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something that I've
been studying, and teaching

00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and writing about, recently,
is that, they liken it

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.572 align:middle line:84%
to-- that you could
be meditating,

00:12:24.572 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and your house is all dirty--
your house isn't going to get

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:90%
clean until you clean it.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the
world right now, it's

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.295 align:middle line:90%
kind of got a cancer.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's a small
cancer, and they

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
said there's three
ways to heal cancer.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a metaphor.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They said, you can
cut it out, you know,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.449 align:middle line:84%
which is the direct
activism form.

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You can ignore it, and
it'll get worse-- which is

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:90%
what a lot of people are doing.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to look at it.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.032 align:middle line:90%
Or you can spiritually heal it.

00:12:50.032 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
that's the method

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:90%
they'd like to see us use.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
That we have the power-- through
prayer, through visualization,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:84%
through all the tools
you teach about--

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:90%
to heal the cancer in the world.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you hear
these messages come in,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
do you feel the
messages as well?

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Or do you see them?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you hear them, see
them, or feel them?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.911 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's kind
of all the above.

00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, when I ask about
the government's involvements,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.750 align:middle line:84%
it's like someone's
talking to me.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I met him when
I was a child.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a sage.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a guide that
I have with me.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:90%
An old man.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Who, when I was a child, he used
to take me to see the future.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.415 align:middle line:84%
And he would talk to me
about my purpose, and such.

00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty scary--

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Scary at the time.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I mean, I love him.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
He didn't scare me.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But just seeing
these things-- and he

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
would take me to other
planets, and show me things,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.415 align:middle line:84%
and-- and it was just as real
as our experience right here.

00:13:43.415 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For a while, you
denied that communication.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.409 align:middle line:90%
For a long time.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, I
didn't tell people.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I knew it was real.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely-- I mean, it
was not like a regular dream.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:90%
This was tactile.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.971 align:middle line:90%
Full color.

00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Memorable.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --every sense.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Every sense.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It's-- these were
dreams I had as a child.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember them like
they were yesterday.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are-- the
ones that are really

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:90%
divine communication.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about-- when
that information comes in,

00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
have you learned to deal with
it a little bit better now,

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.487 align:middle line:90%
and not be as afraid?

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I really went down the rabbit
hole of fear for a while there.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I think what they call it is
"the weird side of YouTube."

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I went on that too much.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.454 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:14:19.454 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And, you know,
there's a lot of fake fear.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
What I learned is that,
just because it's called

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
alternative news does
not mean that they

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.505 align:middle line:90%
don't have an ego agenda.

00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's alternative
news stations--

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes even
stronger, actually.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.205 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
They want to sell
things based on fear.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.595 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as evil as
the government actions.

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
tell the difference?

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you tell to look
for that piece of truth

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:90%
in whatever might be an agenda?

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I think if you feel
afraid, that's a big red flag.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: And to walk away.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fear.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, you
really can resonate

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:90%
on that energy of fear.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Someone who is
offering solutions--

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
like some of the activist
communities-- will say,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
this is going on, but
here's how we can solve it.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of committees
and news you want to look for.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So the messages that you
receive, though, some of them

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.597 align:middle line:90%
are fear-based?

00:15:11.597 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:90%
And some of them are love-based?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, I got
a lot of messages--

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been getting them my
whole life-- about government.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Wheelings and dealings.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
They're not a secret.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's now
more out in the open

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:90%
than it was when I was a child.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:84%
There's even more
to it that's not

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
been addressed, about
behind the scenes-- it's

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
all about making money.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And about people
who are addicted

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
to being powerful, and
making a name for themselves.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an addiction on their part.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
come from families

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.237 align:middle line:84%
that are having rivalries
with each other, to win.

00:15:49.237 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's, it's very childish
things they're doing.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.304 align:middle line:84%
It's a very dangerous
game they're playing.

00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With the
lives of America.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Of, of--

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --the world, yeah.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you've
got your chemical companies

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.825 align:middle line:84%
masquerading as food companies
right now, and with the most--

00:16:03.825 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say
this-- ingenious PR

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
campaign I've ever seen.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Here in Maui, the
people of Maui,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we decided that we'd
had enough with chemical

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.425 align:middle line:84%
spraying from the Monsanto
plant that's here.

00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just Monsanto.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.383 align:middle line:84%
That's the name that's
always kicked around.

00:16:20.383 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
It's Agenta, and it's
also Bayer, and Dow.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
leaders of this movement,

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.975 align:middle line:84%
called Shaka Movement,
found this cool loophole

00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:84%
in the laws, that said that
something has to be proven

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
safe to be on this island.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we campaigned
to get enough petition

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
signatures to get this
on the ballot last year.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
That we would have a
moratorium on genetic

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
modify experimentation
and chemicals

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
until it could be proven safe.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course it
can't be proven safe.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So the companies
were up in arms,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and they spent up to
$8 million with this.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.615 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
say, objectively,

00:16:58.615 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:90%
it was an ingenious campaign.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The campaign, they said, was
that this was a farm ban,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and there would be police
in all of our backyards

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to check our
gardens, and we'd be

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
put in jail if we were
growing anything that

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:90%
was genetically modified.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:90%
And people believe that here.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there's real
trusting people here.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, we
won-- by just a margin--

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: 2% to 3%.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.023 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: But right now
it's still in court,

00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
because there's
politicians here who

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:84%
are being paid off by Monsanto,
who are not allowing the law

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:90%
to go through.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
this in Oregon,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing this
in Colorado, you're

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
seeing this in all the states.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Even Vermont, that did
pass a labeling law.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing-- it's a
chemical company who's-- now,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.302 align:middle line:84%
their PR campaign is you
need us to feed the world,

00:17:46.302 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
because the world's going
to starve without us.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely not
backed up by science,

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that shows that organics are
actually increasing crops,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and keep right up with genetic
modification food, that--

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are they--

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.429 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --that-- yeah.

00:17:59.429 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
In terms of yield,
it's identical.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in 1996, the angels
told me to get off

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
a list of chemicals--
to stop ingesting them.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me a whole list.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote about it, and
have it up on my website.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I took that to heart.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I became organic
and vegan in 1996,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and stopped buying shampoo
at regular stores, started

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
using health food
toiletries and everything.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, it's kind
of like the world is

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
hearing that angel message
that I heard a long time ago.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's so beautiful.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Because even on
mainstream shows--

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
there's this show in
America called "Shark Tank."

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.249 align:middle line:84%
It's also called "Dragon's
Den" somewhere else.

00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch
it, it's a fun show,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
these people who

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
have ideas, that
are entrepreneurs,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.491 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to talk to
these venture capitalists.

00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear probably
about half of them

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
bragging that their product,
if it's food, is non-GMO,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:90%
or organic.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And every one-- and
these billionaires are going,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's great it's
organic and non-GMO.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
You didn't hear that,
even five years ago.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember reading
about non-GMO in "Rolling Stone"

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
magazine, which was
alternative 10 years ago,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
but there was really
no talk about it.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Because of these campaigns--

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And its powered by
the people campaigns.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
These were-- the whole movement
was powered by the people.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.267 align:middle line:84%
And it was just voted down
by the select companies.

00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The larger companies,
with the big, huge media

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:90%
campaigns.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.179 align:middle line:84%
But they-- the people,
the movement, it

00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
will continue on, because it
was started by the people.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, it's
giving people confidence.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I see is, there's
all these offshoot or activism

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.359 align:middle line:84%
campaigns, you know, there's
Moms Against Monsanto,

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
different campaigns.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if I
was Monsanto's head,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.044 align:middle line:84%
I would change the
name of the company.

00:19:48.044 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to be the
most despised company

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:90%
name in the world?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But this is what the
angels are talking about.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a time of taking action.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.837 align:middle line:84%
So will that work
into the future?

00:19:58.837 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.487 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it is.

00:20:00.487 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
It's going to make a difference.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
what it is, is they

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
told me-- this is about
three years ago-- they said

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:90%
there would be whistle blowers.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And they said that most of them
were indigos-- young people.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're relatively young.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:90%
30s.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
20s and 30s.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.035 align:middle line:84%
And Edward Snowden's
among them, and, you know,

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a few who
aren't so well known,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
but that this will continue
to be whistle blowers.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:90%
That the darkness cannot hide.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
That secrets are now being
exposed to the light.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So we can expect
that to continue.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: God bless
whistle blowers, right?

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
That was beautifully said--
the darkness cannot hide.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.939 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at a video

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.906 align:middle line:84%
here, where Doreen's talking
about what's coming up

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:90%
in the future of this year.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.928 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:42.904 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:44.368 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
-Hi.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It's Doreen, and happy 2015.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
This is your annual
angel card reading.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to work this
year with this deck of cards.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:84%
After praying about
what deck to use,

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
this one came through
very loud and clear.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the "Daily Guidance From
Your Angels Oracle Cards."

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the deck that I always
recommend to those beginning

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
with working with angel
cards, and I'm obviously not

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
a beginner, and I
still choose to work

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
with this deck, again and again
and again-- one of the reasons

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
being that, even though
it comes with a guidebook,

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.577 align:middle line:84%
each card has a message
written so thoroughly on it

00:21:36.577 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even have
to consult the guidebook.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Just read the cards and
listen to God and your angels.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So as you saw, I've been
praying over these cards,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm asking the
Lord to send all of us

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
guidance, lessons, and
blessings for 2015.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be drawing 12 cards

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and talking with you about this.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But before I draw
those cards, I want

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to give you some messages
that have already been coming

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:90%
to me about this new year.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they
wanted me to remind you

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
is that, for those of you who,
like me, are history buffs, who

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
read history books,
watch history shows,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
you've read the
Bible, which is really

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
a historical, beautiful
book, and then

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
other books going even farther
back to Babylonian times

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and Egyptian times,
you'll know that things

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:90%
happen on this planet.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:90%
This is a physical, 3-D planet.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And earth changes happen.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:90%
People's egos come about.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
There's just nasty
things that happen.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course that's an ego
judgment, to call it nasty.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But with the advent
of the internet,

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
we instantly know about
what's going on in this world.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And it can seem like
more is going on.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to just
reassure you that these

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
are things that happen in
the 3-D physical plane.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us, unconsciously--
or maybe even

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
consciously-- remember
heaven as a place

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
where there was
love, and compassion,

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and mind-to-mind communication--
and most of all, peace.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
There was no competition.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
There was no revenge.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
There was no "that's
mine," "give me this,"

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
or violence of any kind
like that in heaven.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And on a soul level,
we keep trying

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to recreate that here on the
3-D plane of duality, Earth.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This is something I talk
about in depth in my book,

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
"Assertiveness
for Earth Angels,"

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to
remind you of this,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
because it seems like
right around the beginning

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
of the year, and then
the end of the year,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
there's this perfectionism that
we go into, where we're saying,

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
if this is going
to be a good year,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
then therefore nothing bad
will happen in the world.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, sure
enough, some tragedy

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
happens somewhere--
not to diminish it.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's this part of
our ego that says, see?

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I told you.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:90%
This year is ruined.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.006 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
watch out for that.

00:23:58.006 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that is, as I said,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:90%
an ego-based perfectionism.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It's unrealistic in
this world to think

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that nothing's going to happen.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's part
of the life cycle.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
horrible tragedies happen.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people in this world who

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
act in ways that the rest
of us can't understand--

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very
sad, and very upsetting.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do, though,
is to stay on our own path,

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
while praying for
all those situations.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're guided to help in
other ways, such as donating,

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
or getting involved, great.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But mainly, you're here
to be a teacher of peace.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And the best way that
you can teach peace

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:90%
is to be at peace yourself.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And that means not
letting yourself

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
get distracted and pulled off
the path by these news stories.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember that news
is a very yang,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
or the ego side of
the masculine energy,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's all reporting
those competitions.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It's all reporting the
revenge, and the plotting,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and the violence.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who
are highly sensitive,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:84%
we need the more yin
energy-- the more feminine,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
sacred feminine energy-- which
is cooperation and nurturing,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, the more that
you can do things

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that help you to be at peace--
and you know what they are,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and your guidance is giving
you this all the time--

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
eating well, getting
enough sleep,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
staying away from negative
people and negative situations,

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and really going
to positive places.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Going outside in nature.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Spending time with
beautiful, peaceful people--

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe at your spiritual
classes, or-- I

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
love yoga studios is
a wonderful, kind of,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
temple, modern day
temple you can go to,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and really listening
to soft, gentle music.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Indulging in arts and crafts.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Creativity.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Working with essential
oils and crystals.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:90%
And of course, prayer.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And meditation.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of these activities
that you engage in

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
help you to do your
life path, your purpose

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of being a teacher of peace.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Of glowing.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Of being that reflection of
God's beautiful light and love.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so 2015 is-- what
they're telling me,

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
the theme this year is,
it's about taking action.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:84%
They are telling me that this
year, you are extra intuitive.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Extra open.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And that you are getting
literal, million dollar ideas.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas are
downloading to you

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.910 align:middle line:90%
as answers to your prayers.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been
asking for how you can

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:90%
be in a more meaningful career.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
How you can contribute
to this world in a way

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that is important to your
soul, and your heart.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And helps others.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been praying
for financial security,

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:90%
or more health.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The ideas are the
answers to your prayers.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
They come as
repetitive thoughts.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Ideas.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Or feelings that come again
and again, to do something,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:90%
to take some action.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They might come as
signs, where you

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.535 align:middle line:84%
keep getting told over and over
again to read a certain book,

00:27:12.535 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:90%
or take a certain class.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Or phrases come to
you, again and again.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Those are like the crumbs
on a trail-- breadcrumbs

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
on a trail-- leading you to what
the answer to your prayer is.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And every person on this
planet who, right now, today,

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:84%
is enjoying peace, and security,
and fulfillment and success,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they've taken and are
taking action steps.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
excluding you from this.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that all
of us who take action steps,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:90%
we wrestle with our ego, too.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the bigger
your life purpose is,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the louder your ego will get.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So the bigger your purpose,
the louder the fear is.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.447 align:middle line:84%
So we can't let
fear hold us back.

00:27:57.447 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how can we
use the new intuition

00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that you talked
about in that video

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.984 align:middle line:84%
to help us tune into
these messages ourselves?

00:28:04.984 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
first of all, it's

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.579 align:middle line:84%
about being-- are
you ready for them?

00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Because once you do, your
whole life will change.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.931 align:middle line:90%
As you know.

00:28:11.931 --> 00:28:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So some people
want-- they want--

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
they have one foot
on the gas pedal,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and one foot on the break,
when it comes to intuition.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.749 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
to hear messages.

00:28:19.749 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But they only want to hear
it on their own terms.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to hear that
they have to change their job,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that they really shouldn't
be in this relationship.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way,
that friend is not

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
a good friend, and
that you should move,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and you should
exercise-- you know,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
they want to hear messages
on their own terms.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you're open to hearing
whatever the truth is,

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that's when everything starts.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people,
the best way to start

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is, when you go to sleep--
as you're falling asleep--

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:84%
you've got guardian
angels with you.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Ask those guardian angels
to come into your dreams

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.954 align:middle line:84%
and answer a specific
question you have.

00:28:52.954 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be a question
of, what's next for me?

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.205 align:middle line:90%
Should I leave my job?

00:28:58.205 --> 00:29:00.572 align:middle line:84%
If I start my own business,
will it be a success?

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:90%
How will I find my soul mate?

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.071 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your question is,
just ask your guardian angel

00:29:04.071 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:90%
as you're falling asleep.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And then they will answer you.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're sleeping,
the ego's asleep, too.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're wide open.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up, you may
not remember the dream,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:84%
but you'll have
that answer in you.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if that
answer isn't something

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can handle at the
time, can you then pray,

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and say, allow me to
be able to increase

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
my havingness for that answer,
or be able to handle that?

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I wish
people would do that.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:90%
That'd be great.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:84%
That takes being highly
evolved, to even think of that.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just
what I thought of,

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.757 align:middle line:84%
just now, is that yes,
I might get the answer,

00:29:31.757 --> 00:29:33.090 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know how to do that.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.119 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:84%
The "how" is what's
so interesting.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all taught,
through Western schooling,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to plan ahead, and to make
sure your ducks are in a row

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
before you move forward.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you work with the
divine, it's not like that.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It's truly walking a step
at a time, and faith.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So they will show you, if you
ask, what's the next step.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.344 align:middle line:84%
But they won't show
you 20 steps from now.

00:29:56.344 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that
you wouldn't believe it.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's just the next step.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.182 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a breadcrumb trail.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.512 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:30:02.512 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said something
really beauti-- brilliant.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
You said that having
angels with you

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
is just like having
your lungs with you.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.176 align:middle line:84%
You know they're there, but they
just work for you all the time.

00:30:14.176 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And they just
continually work for you.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And you can't
survive without angels.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can't
survive without them.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So every single one of us
listening and watching this

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:90%
has an angel.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And maybe many, with us.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Whether we know it or not.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they help us,
whether we know it or not.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a
beautiful message.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: They're our
connection to home.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.192 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is not home.

00:30:34.192 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:90%
This-- we're all on vacation.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.858 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are here
on assignment--

00:30:36.858 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:90%
it's not so much a vacation.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.479 align:middle line:84%
But there's this part of
all of us that's homesick.

00:30:41.479 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Deep down, we all know that
this isn't where we belong.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel like we fit in.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel accepted.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the rules here.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
This is awkward
here, to be here.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It's harsh.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And so the angels help.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they're holding
tubes of oxygen to heaven,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:90%
or what's our home.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And just helping us to
survive and get through this.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's 100
years, max, to be here,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
it seems like a long
assignment when we're here.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are supporting
that-- because we all

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.795 align:middle line:90%
have a mission to do here.

00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you have made a
decision to stop traveling.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Except for once a year, to go
to California and see my peeps.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.593 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:31:15.593 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Your family.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:16.946 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Mm-hm.

00:31:16.946 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where did you
get that communication from,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and why?

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That was just
a general communication

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that many people are
getting-- to respect yourself.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And to take care of yourself.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.401 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote
this book-- "Assertiveness

00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:90%
For Earth Angels."

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.075 align:middle line:84%
Because I was-- being a
first-born child, and kind

00:31:36.075 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of being co-dependent, I
wanted to please my parents.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Get straight A's-- you
know, be the hero child.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I continued
that through my life.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And when my publisher
told me-- it's--

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me just segue for a minute.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're a writer, you
tend to be an introvert.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're kind of shy.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:84%
To sit there at your
desk and write a book

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
requires a certain
amount of introversion.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've
done this 50 times.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.405 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:31:59.405 --> 00:32:02.272 align:middle line:84%
And so, then, once
you finish the book,

00:32:02.272 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
you're told to go out
and be with people,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and tell them about the book.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:90%
These don't always go together.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was really a
natural part of my growth

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to go for 25 years around
the world, teaching.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it
was real enjoyable.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It changed me.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.500 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It growed me up.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It helped me to
learn, and expand

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
beyond just American culture,
and see how the rest of world

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:90%
But it was not natural for me.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, I'm a
triple earth sign.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Meaning homebody.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I like to be home.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And so every time I
would have to leave,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
it was like Velcro, trying
to get me off of my house.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And then
when I moved to Maui,

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.955 align:middle line:84%
and I started-- I had
got even more pets.

00:32:45.955 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I came over
here with a bunch of pets.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But since I've been in
Maui, now I have 30 pets.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.296 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:51.296 --> 00:32:52.420 align:middle line:90%
So you don't want to leave.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.753 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I don't want to leave.

00:32:53.753 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's rainbows
here-- anuenues.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:90%
There's the warm ocean.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There's relatively clean
air here, and safety,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and so it just got to be
more and more painful.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I started doing
this filming and making

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:90%
online videos.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.841 align:middle line:84%
And not only was that
more convenient for me,

00:33:10.841 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
it was more convenient
for the people attending.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to fly,
or get a hotel room.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.337 align:middle line:90%
Much more economical.

00:33:17.337 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
People would often
complain about the prices

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of my workshops, and I'd be,
like, well, look at this.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:90%
We have to rent this ballroom.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to fly here.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I have staff.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have those issues
with an online class.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.750 align:middle line:90%
You simply have a video.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you--
really, the transmission

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of the communication
from the angels

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.852 align:middle line:90%
comes through these videos.

00:33:34.852 --> 00:33:35.435 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's really beautiful.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.217 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're done
in your home setting.

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.080 align:middle line:90%
So I'm much happier.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.562 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gorgeous, too.

00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at one of the videos

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
here, where Doreen's talking
about her book "Assertiveness

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:90%
For Earth Angels."

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.992 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:51.125 --> 00:34:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:90%
-Hi.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
I'm Doreen Virtue-- author of
the new book, "Assertiveness

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:90%
For Earth Angels."

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:84%
And host of the online
class with the same title.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:84%
Today I'd like to talk with you
briefly about how assertiveness

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.070 align:middle line:90%
helps your dreams to come true.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And how the opposite,
aggression, or being passive,

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.920 align:middle line:84%
actually blocks you from
your heart's desire.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Every day I get posts
on Facebook or letters

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
from readers who say
to me, essentially,

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:90%
what are the angels say?

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Will I get the job
I want this year?

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
Will I get the husband
I want this year?

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Will I be able to move?

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:84%
And these questions
are heartfelt,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and I have such
compassion for everyone

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:84%
who wants to know the
answers to these questions.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so part of what
I want to teach today

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is how to help you with
questions such as this.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So assertiveness is
very, very different

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
from aggressiveness, and
passivity, as I've mentioned.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:84%
What aggressiveness does is,
it comes from a place of fear.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Aggression says, ooh,
I might not get this.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I might not get a
lack of what I desire.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to chase after it.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to push for it.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try and
control the outcome.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, every
time you chase after anything,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
it runs away from you.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're chasing
after getting a soul mate

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
relationship, or a better job,
or a better place to live,

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:84%
or more clairvoyance,
pushing, and trying

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to force it to
happen never works.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes from
that space of lack.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It comes from that
underlying fear

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:90%
of maybe this won't happen.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And any time you
put that fear out,

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that's what manifests,
unfortunately.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.147 align:middle line:84%
Now, the flip side
of aggressiveness--

00:35:55.147 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
it might seem like the
opposite, but it's actually

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:84%
just another side to
aggressiveness-- is passivity.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Passivity is where we
sit there and we say,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:90%
I wish this would happen.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's different
than praying.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Praying for it.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Please, God-- please
send me my soul mate.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Please, God-- please give
me this job of my dreams.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Please help me to find a safe,
comfortable home that I love,

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
and easily afford.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Those kind of prayers
are active and assertive.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Because you'll get answers.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:90%
You'll get divine guidance.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to take action
on the divine guidance.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the key to
assertiveness--

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
is taking action
from a place of love.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
The opposite--
aggression-- takes action

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:90%
from a place of lack, and fear.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it just
goes out of its way

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to push, to control,
to try to force.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And passivity takes a
different kind of action step.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Passivity means that you're so
afraid of being disappointed--

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:84%
you're afraid of getting
your heart broken,

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:84%
once again-- that
you don't even try.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:90%
You give up.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of
depression, to be passive.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
In passivity, you might even
get sarcastic, or callous.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You might say, dream on.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:90%
That'll never happen.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
That happens to other people.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:90%
They're lucky.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Not me.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Cancel, clear, delete.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Because those
aren't true at all.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Unless you affirm it enough.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
putting out to the universe.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:84%
With passivity, you're not
taking any action steps

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:90%
outside of in your mind.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You're taking internal action
steps to block and thwart

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:90%
what your dreams are.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's
what it takes.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It takes a monumental
amount of energy,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and an effort to
block the universe

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:90%
from answering your prayers.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is on your side.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:90%
It wants to answer your prayers.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.580 align:middle line:84%
God wants to help you,
like any loving parent,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that you have
plenty to spare and share--

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, for your
family, your loved ones,

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and to donate to
charities of your choice.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But you can block all of that
gift energy with worrying.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:90%
With affirming in the negative.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I have a soul mate?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I have enough money?

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I have a good job?

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I hear people say this at
every workshop I go to,

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and I have to stop them
and say, why are you

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:90%
affirming that you don't have?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's affirm what you
do want-- not what

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:90%
you are afraid you don't have.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So affirming is
a form of prayer.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of assertiveness.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And affirming comes
from that place of love.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And it says thank you, God,
for this wonderful job.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, God, for
this wonderful home.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, God, for
my perfect health.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, God,
for my happiness.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, God, for my
soul mate relationship,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Just affirming, and
praying, and then

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:90%
following your divine guidance.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It might seem to be
so subtly simple,

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:90%
but it is the action of love.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And love, after all, is
the only power there is.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.830 align:middle line:84%

I'm so looking forward to
working with you personally.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
On class four, I'll be taking

And I am just so
excited to work with you

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and help you on
your way, because I

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.720 align:middle line:84%
know that when you're
on your purpose,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to help so
many of us on this planet.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Sending you lots of love,
angel blessings, and aloha.

>>LISA: So "Assertiveness
For Earth Angels."

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier,
that you tended

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to be more of an introvert and
not speak up for yourself so

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:84%
much, many people
feel that way that

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:90%
are in that same vibration.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Not speaking up for yourself.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Allowing yourself
to be treated badly.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Not saying "no"
when you need to.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So how do you teach
us to do that?

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, I think some
people have to hit bottom

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.200 align:middle line:90%
with it, you know.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.366 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, some people
get really serious health

00:40:41.366 --> 00:40:45.321 align:middle line:84%
conditions from storing up anger
and resentment all those years.

00:40:45.321 --> 00:40:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Addiction?

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Addictions--
for me, I would run away.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.818 align:middle line:84%
I would get in an
unhealthy relationship,

00:40:49.818 --> 00:40:52.611 align:middle line:84%
and instead of dealing with
it I would run away from it.

00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And start over, and then get
another unhealthy relationship.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.515 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point, if you
see this unhealthy pattern

00:40:58.515 --> 00:41:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, we
need to look at it.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So with "Assertiveness
For Earth Angels,"

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:84%
it's really been me sharing this
process of sensitive people.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It's really about,
being highly sensitive,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:84%
people can feel what
other people are thinking.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to please
the other people,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
because we can feel
what they want to hear.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we lose our
own self with that.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We become real inauthentic,
and we lose our personal power.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So "Assertiveness
For Earth Angels"

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:84%
really talks about
the high cost you're

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:84%
paying by giving away yourself--
not only in terms of health,

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of the mission
you came here to do.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we-- we've come
here to be teachers.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow someone
to treat you badly,

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.080 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching
that person it's OK.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.738 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And then
they might go on

00:41:42.738 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:90%
to treat another person badly.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.039 align:middle line:84%
So speaking our truth
is not aggressive.

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:84%
That's where people get
mixed up-- aggressiveness

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and assertiveness.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Assertiveness simply means
lovingly saying, hey,

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I feel like this right now.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I feel stressed when
I hear you say that.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I feel unsafe when
I hear you say that.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Owning the feelings.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Not saying "you make
me feel this way."

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And then, in
a healthy relationship,

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.237 align:middle line:84%
the person will hear
that, and then negotiate

00:42:09.237 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with them.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, now, we all have issues.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing a
new book right now

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.060 align:middle line:84%
about how stress has
affected all of us.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I mean, there's nobody
who's unscarred right now.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, part of it, too,
is having compassion.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:84%
When we give our
power away to someone,

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a boss,
or a co-worker,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:37.400 align:middle line:84%
or anyone who frightens us, then
we have taken the power away,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:90%
from God, and from ourselves.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And we also are not seeing
the real relationship;

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.530 align:middle line:84%
we're reacting to
kind of a cartoon,

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.671 align:middle line:84%
or a movie that's inside of us,
instead of that real person.

00:42:47.671 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Archangel
Michael is someone

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.441 align:middle line:90%
that you speak about a lot.

00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:51.190 align:middle line:90%
"Someone," I say--

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: He's the boss.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The boss.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.340 align:middle line:84%
What type of communication
is coming through right now?

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: At this very moment?

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:00.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, he has
a good sense of humor.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:84%
He said-- it all comes through
so strong-- but the bottom line

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that I got for all of us is
to really work on our heart,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.290 align:middle line:84%

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
That we feel out of control,

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and that the hunger for control
is driving us to addictions.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%

only control you have

I could feel her heart
open, and opening my heart.

>>VIRTUE: And I think
it's why I have 10 dogs.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Because they are literal angels.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And every time I need anything
to keep my heart open,

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I hold one of my dogs.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And it-- you know
what it reminds me of?

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to Lourdes,
France a few years ago.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And went to the grotto that
Saint Bernadette dug up,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.220 align:middle line:90%
because Mother Mary told her to.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you get close to that
grotto, it feels like heaven.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:84%
If you-- you can feel the energy
of angels swirling around you.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.826 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, visually, it's
just insane to go there,

00:44:53.826 --> 00:44:55.700 align:middle line:84%
because there's all
these gurneys with people

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:84%
on their deathbed, and
being pushed up to the well,

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and something like
70 people have

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:84%
been healed of terminal

Napoleon's daughter back then.

But anyway, so being with dogs
reminds me of being at Lourdes.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because some angels
take on human forms

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:90%

00:45:55.305 --> 00:45:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the fastest path.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.551 align:middle line:90%

Right now, we can all
answer that question

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:19.390 align:middle line:84%
by opening our hearts and

Since every recorded

that's all going to stop.

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:84%
What's going to stop is us
getting caught up in the fear.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:42.070 align:middle line:84%
There are some organizations
artificially creating

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:84%
tragedies, to make us afraid,
so that we will be manipulated

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.380 align:middle line:90%
in their direction.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is happening with a lot
of the big, violent things that

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.010 align:middle line:90%
are on the news.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them
are engineered.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're dramatic,
Hollywood produc--

00:52:59.110 --> 00:52:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've heard.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.040 align:middle line:90%
No, I've heard.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: They're productions.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: School
shootings, things--

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Everything.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.115 align:middle line:90%
All of that is just completely--

00:53:06.115 --> 00:53:07.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --manufactured.

00:53:07.073 --> 00:53:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: What I love is that--
it used to be, people would be,

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.528 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, my God, oh,
my God, oh, my God.

00:53:11.528 --> 00:53:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But I'm seeing where it's not
that people are getting jaded,

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.880 align:middle line:84%
but they're not getting
caught in-- getting hooked

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.990 align:middle line:90%
into the fear.

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.260 align:middle line:84%
That's our mission--
is not to get hooked

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.950 align:middle line:84%
in the fear of the
artificial productions.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's weather
modification-- you know,

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:84%
one country fights another
by creating storms.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.220 align:middle line:90%
So they create tsunamis.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how wars
are happening right now.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.626 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Weather.

00:53:33.626 --> 00:53:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Weather.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wars.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:35.135 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:53:35.135 --> 00:53:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's been happening
since the '60s.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But now it's more open.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.327 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we just can't--
you can't let your ego get

00:53:43.327 --> 00:53:45.660 align:middle line:84%
hooked in, and see-- think,
oh, my God, the end is near.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.910 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do that.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to be the
children of the light--

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and really be the
role models of peace.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And it really reminds me
of when I'm on an airplane,

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.030 align:middle line:90%
and there's big turbulence.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.446 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you do is, you
watch that flight attendant

00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:01.930 align:middle line:90%
to see her expression.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And if she's still
smiling, you know

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:05.280 align:middle line:90%
it's just normal turbulence.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:84%
We are the same as
the flight attendants.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
When there's turbulence
in our world,

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.250 align:middle line:90%
we have to still be smiling.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And at peace.

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
wonderful example,

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:84%
because yes, there will be
things that are happening,

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and major tragedies, because
they are being manufactured.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:84%
People are starting to
look more towards the truth

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.029 align:middle line:90%
of the tragedy first.

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: But let
me just interject--

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.840 align:middle line:84%
while looking at
the truth, blaming

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:90%
is not a helpful energy.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And saying, oh, this
person's evil, or that's evil.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And even I've said that.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's higher
elevation to have

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.780 align:middle line:84%
compassion on the whole
drama, and then to speak up.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Assertively.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.174 align:middle line:84%
I think the more of us
that are aware of who

00:54:47.174 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the politicians
are, because there

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:50.324 align:middle line:90%
are some good politicians.

00:54:50.324 --> 00:54:52.740 align:middle line:84%
There really are people who
want to get into office who've

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.300 align:middle line:90%
got-- who are in the light.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The more of us who can
educate ourselves who they are

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and vote for them-- register to
be a voter, and vote, and get

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.680 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise
that will work.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do you
know the good ones from--

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You've got
to go see them speak.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
out of your house.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not TV ads.

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not the flyers
you get in the mail.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It's going and meeting them.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And then, helping them.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.139 align:middle line:90%
Donate to them.

00:55:19.139 --> 00:55:21.430 align:middle line:84%
If I find a politician, I
stand on the side of the road

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and hold up their
signs for them.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.279 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want the world
to change, help it to change.

00:55:27.279 --> 00:55:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for joining me,

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.155 align:middle line:84%
and for all of the
wonderful messages

00:55:32.155 --> 00:55:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that you help communicate
so clearly from the divine.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And giving us a glimpse
into the world to come.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Preparing us with
tools, as well--

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to deal
with what's coming up.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I'll say mahalo.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mahalo.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Mahalo.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.219 align:middle line:84%
