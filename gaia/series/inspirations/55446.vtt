00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:10%
And today, we're going to
talk about our relationship

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:10%
with money.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:10%
Is it a love-hate relationship?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it a get together
and then break up

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:90%
really fast relationship?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Does it rule your life?

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, the average household
consumer debt is $15,000.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And the solution
is really changing

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:90%
how we relate with money.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not just spending
less, but whatever

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
your personal relationship
is with money.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And entrepreneur,
Kate Northrup, is

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
joining me to talk
about just that,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:90%
our relationship with money.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And her book is called
"Money: A Love Story."

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you relate money and
love to the same sentence?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KATE NORTHRUP: Well-- I know.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's creative.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.581 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: I know.

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, money is really a
standard for what we value.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a system that we
made up as human beings.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:90%
And money doesn't really exist.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:90%
We literally made it up.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the United
States, it is completely not

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.055 align:middle line:84%
based on anything anymore,
because we got rid

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
of the gold standard
in the '70s.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's paper,
it's numbers.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It's just bleh.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So
it's just a system

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that we exchange
value for value.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:10%
And what we value is
really inextricably linked

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
with our emotions and with
what's important to us,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
because it's different
for everybody.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ways that we
can improve our relationship

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:10%
with our money is to
improve our relationship

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:10%
with ourselves and
our self value.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Because when we
value ourselves we

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:10%
not only put more value
out into the world,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:10%
we also take better care of
the money we already have.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really about
loving ourselves first,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and then from that place
emanating out and creating

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
the prosperity and the abundance
and the service in the world

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.949 align:middle line:90%
that we'd like to create.

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So was it always
like that for you?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.632 align:middle line:90%
Did you start off-- no, no.

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
You were in debt.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: I was in debt, yeah.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I was in more than the average
consumer household debt.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in $20,000 worth
of debt, credit cards.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.217 align:middle line:90%
And I was really--

00:02:00.217 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's easy
to do, by the way.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Oh, yeah.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.427 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You get
out of college, you

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have an income,
things cost money,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
they give you a credit
card, and there it is.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: And there it is.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
And my parents had
always told me don't ever

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
carry a balance on
your credit card.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I will never
forget the first month

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I didn't pay my balance.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, well it's OK.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Just next month I will, right.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And then next month
turned into next month

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:90%
turned into several years later.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:90%
And there it was at 20,000.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've since told
this story and found out

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that 20,000 isn't
actually that high.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.755 align:middle line:84%
But as a 22-year-old,
20,000 was a lot.

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean,
look at the country.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.677 align:middle line:84%
America has trillions
of dollars of debt.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So what are we, mirroring?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It's like
a cultural standard.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
great question, actually.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my work is really
about how we feel about money

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and using money as a tool
to create the lives that

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
are really in alignment
authentically with our values.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Danielle
LaPorte is a fantastic author.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And she once said, "Debt
is neither good nor bad.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just how we feel about it."

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.182 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.576 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an
assumption that debt is bad.

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But there are times--
and I have to say

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.491 align:middle line:84%
as an entrepreneur-- there
are times that I've invested

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in things that I did
not have the cash

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
flow for in that moment,
but I needed the capital

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
as an investment in
my business and was

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
able to make more as a
result of that investment.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think that debt has
to do with-- whether it's

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
good or bad-- has to do with
the consciousness with which we

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:90%
are taking on the debt.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you need to buy a
house and you have a mortgage,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's an investment.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Versus I'm going to
go buy these Jimmy

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Choos, some pair of shoes.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
that's not actually

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:90%
an investment towards anything.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's not really making
the world a better place.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have no problem
with shoes, but still.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It's versus taking that
investment toward something

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
further your education

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:90%
or further your growth.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, or help
others and even go beyond.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So you said you're
an entrepreneur.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And what types of companies
did you start, and how

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
did you decide to do
that rather than take

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.505 align:middle line:84%
on a regular job or an employee
relationship type of job?

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So, I mean, I
started my first business

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:90%
when I was seven with my sister.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't
call it a company.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right,
right, right, right.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It was called
Queen Anne's Lace and Katiedids

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
because my sister's name
is Anne and I'm Kate.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And we sold jewelry and
wild flowers and lemonade.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You sold wild flowers?

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: We did.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.064 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
That people could have picked
right there behind our stand

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But
they bought them.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on to have
dog walking and house sitting

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
and babysitting and all of that.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.431 align:middle line:84%
But my first kind of real
business was when I was 18,

00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I started working with
a network marketing

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
company in direct sales,
because I had this dream

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.575 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to create
financial freedom so that I

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:39.264 align:middle line:84%
could stay at home
with my kids someday.

00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, that's
a whole nother show.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.899 align:middle line:84%
But network marketing is
that whole idea of you've

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.565 align:middle line:84%
got the dream of the
boat and the yacht,

00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you've got
to sell this thing.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, but you did it.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You're one of those people
that crossed it and did it.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, I mean, the
thing is it's a simple system.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
But it was not straightforward.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Like it was not, oh,
I have this dream

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.457 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm just going
to go do it and ta-da.

00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, if it
was simple everybody

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
would be on the yacht.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, totally.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.779 align:middle line:90%
There's so much that comes up.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And how the book kind of
transpired in my curriculum

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
was that I was
working with women

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:90%
starting these businesses.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was noticing that
one of the main things that

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:84%
held them back was their
beliefs about money.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew
the actions to take.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
They knew they needed to get
out there and meet people and do

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
things, but they
weren't doing them.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like-- it's
just the same thing as dieting

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
or being healthy.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We know we need to eat greens.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.637 align:middle line:90%
We know we need to exercise.

00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
But what's the disconnect there?

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Why are we not doing the thing?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why are we not doing it?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So I kind
of did a little digging.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what's up with that?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed it in
my own life, too.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that there was
something juicy, some gold

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
here, around our
mindset and how we

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
feel about money that really
is what creates our reality.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not how good we
are with spreadsheets

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.849 align:middle line:84%
or what savings
plan we're doing.

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff is
nice, but it's sort

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of accessories on top of
really solid money mindset.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're
in an hourly job

00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in an hourly
position, but yet you

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
want to really double
or triple your income,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
you can't figure out how to do
with the hourly position you're

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
your mindset in order

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.685 align:middle line:90%
to actually get to that state.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely, yeah.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.064 align:middle line:84%
What mindset do
you need to change?

00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And what relationship?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, tell me.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
it has to do with,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
like I said at the
beginning, valuing yourself.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed that when I began
to see the ways that I was

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
able to add value in
the world and I actually

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
began to take myself seriously
and take my thoughts seriously

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and my opinions and my
own voice seriously,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.985 align:middle line:84%
my income increased
dramatically.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Give me an example.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So this is
practical example from my life.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can give more that
might apply to other people.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was in a
lot of debt, and I

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
was partnered with
my mom in a business.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't think that
my contribution was worth much.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was really attaching to
her brand and her personality.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
My mom's Doctor
Christiane Northrup.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And she has an amazing brand
and is such a beautiful person.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I love my mom so much.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
taking a backseat,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.914 align:middle line:84%
because I just
thought, well she's--

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all
about her, right?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we dismantled
that business relationship,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
because it was no longer serving
either one of us, what happened

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
is I began to write.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I began to teach workshops
around this work around women

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%
and money.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started making
money because I

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
was adding more value to the
world from the perspective

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.986 align:middle line:84%
of first stepping into
I'm actually enough.

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, so it makes sense.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It's a subtle shift,
but it's pretty significant.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And that will happen
in a job, for example,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
if you're having an hourly wage
or you're working on a salary

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:90%
and you want to make more.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
If you don't value
yourself first,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.224 align:middle line:84%
you are not going
to be offered the--

00:07:57.224 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Promotion, whatever.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: The promotion.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the word.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.009 align:middle line:84%
The promotion or the new gig,
the more responsibilities.

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be offered
the new job, because you don't

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
show up in the same
powerful way if you

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:90%
think you're a piece of crap.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is true.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
No, actually, even if you
are in that hour thing

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's not a
chance for a promotion,

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:90%
you can do what you did.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You could create
something that you're

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
passionate about,
do it on the side

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:84%
until then you gain
the confidence in that.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Exactly.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is
easier said than done.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It is absolutely
easier said than done.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.375 align:middle line:84%
And it's risky, but if
you're doing it on the side,

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have
to be that risky.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, starting a blog is free.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
And learning some
of these things.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:84%
You can do such amazing
searches on Google and YouTube

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
for free information and
build a business from there.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Or build your passion
or do whatever

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
you want to do-- singing,
songwriting, whatever.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Talk about the internet.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the internet
itself exponentially

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:90%
is growing every single year.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so if starting
online businesses

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is a really great way to be
with a very low overhead.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And you just provide
a service to people

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.947 align:middle line:84%
who you can find a
niche audience online.

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:00.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:02.446 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
whole type of thing.

00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But it has to start
with you valuing yourself.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're out there
trying to start a business

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.332 align:middle line:84%
and you have this tape
running in your head

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that you have
nothing good to offer

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and you have
nothing good to say,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to have the
wherewithal and the get up

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and go to move past
the fear, which

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.215 align:middle line:90%
is never going to go away.

00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually take the action
that you need to take.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But what's cool is, it kind
of starts to beget itself.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.862 align:middle line:84%
So when you take one loving
action or one self valuing

00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
action, then you're kind
of proving to yourself

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.819 align:middle line:90%
that you value yourself.

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
easier and easier.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you say in your
book to value yourself

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:90%
more than you value money.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Now we're taught
all of our lives

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that you need to make money
to live and to eat and to have

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
a house or shelter.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:90%
So we're not taught that.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught
to value ourselves

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and then the money
will follow; we're

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
taught to make money and
then find self value.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Right,
and that's backwards.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's
what is right now.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It is what is.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But we have to just decide
to do it a different way,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only
way that things change.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And even though
you can say like,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, well this is what it is.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
realities in the economy

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:90%
and certain realities.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, we
just have to choose

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.817 align:middle line:84%
to put our attention in
a different direction.

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Otherwise, if you
keep buying into that system,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%
it just keeps
perpetuating itself.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, with the
self value thing,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
valuing-- well,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean certainly
valuing yourself

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
more than money is important--
but it's saying, OK,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
because money is just
this made up thing.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
We made it up a couple
of thousand years ago.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.712 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it was an exchange.

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It used to
be that if you had a cow

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.322 align:middle line:84%
and I had a goat,
and I wanted your cow

00:10:46.322 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted my
goat, we just switched.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Traded.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: We just traded.

00:10:49.535 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Or I had beans or
whatever I had.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And now it's that
you have your cow

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and I have some
money that I made

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
from selling my goat to somebody
else who wanted the goat.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it is just a trade
for value for value.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I will say I value this
chunk of cash X amount,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.439 align:middle line:90%
and I value that cow X amount.

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:12.022 align:middle line:84%
And you want this
chunk of cash so you

00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:90%
can go get something else.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
And I want the cow.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever
thought about the fact

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.796 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
cash anymore, though?

00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%

OK, so some people might
see that as a problem,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:90%
or confusing, or whatever.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I see
it that way too.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But the opportunity
there is because we

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
are getting more and
more separated from money

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
actually being based on
something of substance.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.872 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems very
intentional, though.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It really
is almost an opening

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
for that more spiritual view
of money, where you can say OK,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:90%
well the more I value myself.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.564 align:middle line:90%
Like you can just practice it.

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes it's nice
to talk about something,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
but then you have to
prove it to yourself,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.576 align:middle line:84%
because you might think I'm
a complete crazy person.

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
To value yourself
first and notice

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:84%
what happens
energetically, people

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
will start offering
you better gigs.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:90%
You will make more money.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And what's cool about
valuing yourself

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is, you take better care of the
money you've already earned.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.965 align:middle line:84%
Because in essence, it's
a mirroring, a reflection

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:84%
of the value you've
given in the world.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you value yourself
and you're saying,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.559 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I am worth
this, then you're

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:90%
going to take that money.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to wad
up your bills in your pocket.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to not cash the check

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and lose the gift certificate
and not invoice your clients.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you're going to
really care for that money

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.729 align:middle line:84%
as an extension of
caring for yourself.

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about some of the issues

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:90%
that people have around money.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.023 align:middle line:84%
Because you probably could
be like a money psychologist.

00:12:48.023 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You could hear what people
say and you can immediately

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:90%
tell their issue money, right.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.686 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about wadding
up money and throwing it

00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
all over the house, and
change and stuff like that.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, so that
is not respecting your money

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and not thinking
that-- Oftentimes,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
it can be connected
with a belief

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that is not spiritual
to have money,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
or that somehow money is dirty,
or that people who have money

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:90%
are greedy or evil.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are some of
the thought memes

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that have been circulated
through the culture

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.574 align:middle line:90%
or from our parents or whatever.

00:13:22.574 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're not
respecting money--

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
like when we're just take
the cash and wad it up

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:90%
or you lose checks.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I used to be somebody
who would lose checks.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I would get a check,
and it was just

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
like I don't know
where I put it.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And crazy
stuff, you know.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is really--
you really need

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to dig deeper and say, OK
what is my belief here.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Because my actions--
if you say you

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
want to make more money,
which most people do.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.004 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:13:48.004 --> 00:13:49.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But
then your actions

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
are like wadding up the
bills and losing checks

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and not invoicing
clients-- doesn't line up.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Doesn't connect.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And so there's a
disconnect between your actions

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and what you believe, because
what we believe actually

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:90%
does create our actions.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
to just look at, OK,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:90%
what did I learn in childhood?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the opportunities

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
to say, what did my
parents teach me.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Do I even believe those things?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to take
those things on,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
or am I just doing
it unconsciously?

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I just remember childhood
memories of my parents

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:90%
making bad investments.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was always--
it was a crisis.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I just remember the conversation
of we lost all that money.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.965 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed myself repeating
that pattern in this lifetime.

00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to
know how to break that.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the best things
is to first become aware of it.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm aware of it.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Because,
which is great.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Because physics actually does
prove that when we become aware

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
of something, our consciousness
or our perception of it

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:90%
actually does shift that thing.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's in
the physical world.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.206 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about the
emotional and energetic world.

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
same rules apply.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:90%
So becoming aware of it.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a
girlfriend actually who

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
she has noticed a
pattern in herself,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that she builds a company
to a certain point.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And then she creates
a total break down,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and everything falls
apart just before it's

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.467 align:middle line:84%
going to like really get big, or
what her consideration of big.

00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's noticed she's
done this like five or six

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.345 align:middle line:90%
times in her lifetime.

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But she only
recently noticed the pattern.

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And now she's at
that point again.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
She built the company
to this place.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And now she's talking about it.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
So she has named the pattern.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, this has been
my pattern in the past.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity
to change it.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking a different action.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And she has outlined
the new action plan.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And she's holding herself to it.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And she's told her
community so that they

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
can hold her to it as well.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.206 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And
one of the things

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.121 align:middle line:84%
is, we don't talk
about money enough.

00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
going to say that.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: I like
that one mind thing.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: No.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Money seems to be the dirty
little secret that we don't--

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, totally.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.269 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It's such a taboo.

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So everybody
wants to have more money

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and to be having more
sex or better sex.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But we're not allowed to talk
about either of those things.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no we're not.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Right.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's
what everybody wants.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It's what everybody
is thinking about all the time.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And those are both
second chakra issues.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So the second chakra is
the reproductive organs,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%
the low back.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Its money, sex, and power.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So how we interact with
money in our lives,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
with sex in our
lives, and with power

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
some things in common.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And so
I just think, OK,

00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
like do you need to go
up to a random person

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:90%
and ask them how much they make?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:90%
No, it's inappropriate.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.345 align:middle line:84%
That's like a
boundary violation.

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like how
much sex do you have?

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.054 align:middle line:90%
How much money do you have?

00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: No, it's weird.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.371 align:middle line:90%
Go for it if you want to.

00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not like that.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I like to relate to
people in a way that's

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
more or less
comfortable for them.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.272 align:middle line:90%
That's a good plan.

00:16:38.272 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But some people
love to just shake it up.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not one of those people.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Sitting with your
girlfriends and actually

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
having a conversation
about hey, do you invest.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Or what do you do for this?

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have a great
financial adviser?

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And starting some
sort of a book group.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Reading my book or my friend
Barbara Stanny's books--

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
"The Secrets of Six Figure
Women," something like that.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Doing that so you're
in the conversation.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.839 align:middle line:84%
Because what we put
our attention on grows.

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And so starting to
have those conversations can

00:17:06.797 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
be really educational.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
interesting, because I

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
like that you direct this topic
specifically towards women.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's also very interesting.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
picked up on this

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.022 align:middle line:84%
as well with your interviews on
the "Today Show" and so forth.

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
It's not a topic that
we see going together

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:90%
a lot, women and money.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because women have not
always been the breadwinners

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.059 align:middle line:90%
and the sole earners.

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It's relatively new.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:30.992 align:middle line:90%
And it has switched.

00:17:30.992 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you know
the statistics better

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:90%
than I do about the equal--

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Oh, yeah.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like 43% of
households now have

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.691 align:middle line:84%
a woman who is making
more money, who's

00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:90%
the primary breadwinner.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Which is a lot.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And that
number is probably

00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%
only going to increase.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now it's like I think the
college graduate rate is maybe

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:90%
60% women and 40% men.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
So things are shifting.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But we can't forget
that women only

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
got the right to vote in 1929.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: That's new.

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't do the math in my head.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.272 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But that's very new.

00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: That's new.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're on that
path, and it's going OK.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it is.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But also, there are women who
have higher positions than men

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that are paid less in many
different corporations.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are still considered
lower income earners

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:90%
in corporations.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.119 align:middle line:90%
So there is a long way to go.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.701 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: There
is a long way to go.

00:18:27.701 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And it comes back
to valuing yourself.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Because as a woman in the
workplace or negotiating

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
as even if you're a business
owner, if you take yourself

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%
seriously and you value
yourself and you feel

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
your inherent worth,
you're not going

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to put up with somebody paying
you less than you're worth.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
going to feel wrong.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the shift
that we need to make.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Teaching women
assertiveness, absolutely.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.032 align:middle line:90%
And teaching that we are enough.

00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It really starts there.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.631 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's that
thing where-- take

00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who
are watching the show.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Either a practitioner
or a healer or yoga.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:84%
How do those people
perform a service

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:90%
and then say, pay me for that?

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a healing or
they're giving of themselves.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a disconnect
between that and money.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It is.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the spiritual and
healing world in particular,

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:90%
there's this disconnect.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But we've all probably-- if
you're hanging in the spiritual

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
community a little bit, or
the wellness community--

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we've probably heard the analogy
that we cannot give of an empty

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
cup.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're not filling
your own reserves first

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, energetically,
and financially, you're

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able
to keep showing up

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to give that service.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Right.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like a well.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The pregnancy metaphor is
a really good one here.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.806 align:middle line:84%
If a woman is not
well nutriented,

00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
if she's not getting
good sleep, if she's not

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.305 align:middle line:84%
eating her fruits and veggies
and getting her omega 3s,

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
her baby is not
going to be healthy.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to suffer
from postpartum depression

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.907 align:middle line:84%
and other things afterwards,
because the baby's going

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:90%
to take all the nutrients.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great analogy.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
financially for a practitioner.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're a healer,
healer heal thyself.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do it.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.057 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do it so if
you have to tell yourself

00:20:12.057 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do that just
so you can keep showing up

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.395 align:middle line:84%
for other people, that's
a fine place to start.

00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are wise
beyond your years.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you look like you're 14.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're having all this
great wisdom around money.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: That's funny.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm not
going the only one

00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:90%
that took the attention of that.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Also--

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: I'm 19.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take a look at
Kate on the "Today Show."

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: This morning
on "Today's Money,"

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:10%
whether your financially
secure or deep in debt,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:10%
money always a big
source of stress.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:10%
>>AL ROKER: It
doesn't have to be,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:10%
especially if you
pay attention to how

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:10%
you feel every time you spend.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.217 align:middle line:10%
Kate Northrup is the author
of a new book, "Money:

00:20:41.217 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:10%
A Love Story."

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:10%
Kate, good to see you.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: Hey Kate.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.223 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Good to see you, hi.

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: So your
book is about, really

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:10%
when it comes down to it,
gaining financial freedom.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: It really is, yeah,
emotionally and practically.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And so financial
freedom is really

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:10%
having your passive
income greater

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:10%
than your living expenses.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:10%
And also just feeling
good about your money,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.671 align:middle line:10%
because we have to deal
with money every day.

00:20:59.671 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:10%
And so why not have a
good relationship with it?

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: And you know
of what you write.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.897 align:middle line:10%
You were at one point
were 20,000 bucks in debt.

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Is that right?

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I was.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: How did
you dig your way out?

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: I did it
through getting really

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:10%
real about my living
expenses and my income

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:10%
and proceeding to add
more value to the world

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:10%
in order to increase
my income, which

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.434 align:middle line:10%
is the best way to
increase your income.

00:21:18.434 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Because money is really just
a stand in for what we value.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:10%
So if we add value to
more people's lives,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:10%
our income will increase.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.876 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: And sometimes,
you know, people

00:21:25.876 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:10%
feel badly about spending.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.037 align:middle line:10%
And you have three tips.

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:10%
And I love this first one.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:10%
It says spend money on
what you truly value,

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:10%
not on what you think
you should have.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.990 align:middle line:10%
You'll get more emotional
bang for your buck

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:10%
if you spend money
on what you value,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:10%
which requires identifying
what you value.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:10%
So maybe your values
are community, health,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:10%
and adventure.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at your
spending and orient it

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:10%
in alignment with
those things, you'll

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:10%
actually feel really good
about your spending as opposed

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.345 align:middle line:10%
to spending on things that
you think your mom wants you

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:10%
to have or keeping
up with the Joneses.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: And you spend
less in the process.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
That's the idea.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.443 align:middle line:10%
Because if you're
spending with your values,

00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:10%
then you can spend
less and still

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:10%
feel really good about it.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.725 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: I can hear
people watching this

00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:05.505 align:middle line:10%
though say, emotional
value is great,

00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:10%
but I've got to pay
my rent this month.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:10%
So how does the emotional value
connect to making more money?

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.794 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Great question.

00:22:10.794 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:10%
So your emotional value
is really important,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:10%
because being grateful
for the fact that you

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:10%
can pay your rent, I
mean that's a value.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:10%
Being able to pay
for a living expenses

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:10%
and have a roof over your head.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:10%
And so getting tied into I'm
grateful that I can actually

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:10%
write that check to my
landlord, and thank you

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:10%
for the electricity that I can
flip on a switch every day.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: You also talk about
having a savings account,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.774 align:middle line:10%
but a money for me account.

00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Yes.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:10%
So when it comes to
spending less money,

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:10%
it often feels like deprivation.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:10%
But instead, if you create
a money for me account, what

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:10%
you can do is every
time you save money

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:10%
and you decide not
to spend the money,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:10%
you can put it in your
money for me account.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Or when you negotiate for a
lower rate on your credit card

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:10%
or when you get
unexpected income,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:10%
you get to pay yourself.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:10%
So you're sort of
rewiring yourself to say,

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:10%
this money is for me.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm paying myself
instead of Nordstrom

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:10%
or whomever else might have
gotten the money in the past.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: Now is
that OK in a marriage

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:10%
to have that little side
account for yourself?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: You know, I
think you can name it a money

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:10%
for us account if
you're in a marriage.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: OK.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.901 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: Just go ahead
and go with money for me.

00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: So don't
keep a phantom account.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm asking for a
friend, obviously.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.146 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, obviously.

00:23:19.146 --> 00:23:20.062 align:middle line:10%
>>ROKER: Uh-oh.

00:23:20.062 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: Christina's
not watching.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:10%
She's with the kids, hopefully.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.457 align:middle line:10%
Listen to your body when it
comes to your spending habits.

00:23:25.457 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.706 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: This
is one you're not

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:10%
going to find in other
personal finance books.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.325 align:middle line:10%
What is it is our body is--
you know how you get that gut

00:23:33.325 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:10%
feeling, like it'll
get tense and tight?

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.395 align:middle line:10%
When you look back at your
past spending decisions,

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:10%
go through your
credit card bill,

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:10%
feel into each
expenditure and feel

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:10%
whether your body felt expansive
when you spent that money

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:10%
or contracted.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.606 align:middle line:10%
And then when you look at
your money in the coming times

00:23:49.606 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:10%
when you're going
to spend money,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.669 align:middle line:10%
check in for that
as well and you'll

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:10%
be able to make smarter
spending decisions.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:10%
>>ANCHOR: Different ways
to think about money.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:10%
Kate Northrup, thanks so much.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NORTHRUP: Thank you.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.288 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I
mentioned in the intro

00:23:59.288 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that our relationship with
money has to do with love.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
I got that from you.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
What does money and love
have to do with each other?

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So money and love have
to do with each other,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
because we create a better
relationship with our money

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
through creating a better
relationship with ourself,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:90%
which starts with love.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Self love you mean?

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:20.866 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Self love.

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
The solution to pretty much any
problem you have is self love.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of annoying,
because when people

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.662 align:middle line:84%
say like love yourself more,
I have to say every time,

00:24:28.662 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm in
this world and I

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.396 align:middle line:84%
say that, I think to myself,
yeah, but what does that mean.

00:24:33.396 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, well--

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: What does
that actually mean?

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.656 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I came up
with a new philosophy.

00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at Wayne Dyer
lecture the other night.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And he has L-O-V-E on his shirt.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just started to reverse
it as dyslexia goes with me.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's evolve.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning
of the word evolve.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
E-V-O-L, and you just put
a V-E at the end of that.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn to
love ourselves more,

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
we are learning we
are actually evolving.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As ourselves.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.288 align:middle line:90%
And being able to model that.

00:24:59.288 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest questions
I get from people is, well,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
how do I pass a good money
relationship down to my kids?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:90%
What do I tell them?

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I always say is, clean
up your side of the sidewalk.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Heal it within
yourself and model it.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not a parent
yet, but I know as a child

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and watching children.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a child
anymore, but when I was.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, sure.

00:25:20.995 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: That the
modeling of the behavior

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest force that
we pick up from our parents,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:90%
is we see their behavior.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:90%
We feel how it made them feel.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.139 align:middle line:90%
And then we continue the legacy.

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a double
edged sword there, sweetie.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Because I have a daughter.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have sometimes a hard
time with going to work

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
instead of going
to her soccer game.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if I'm
sending that message to her

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that money is more
important than her.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.752 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Well,
or-- I don't know.

00:25:50.752 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please, please.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But
another option that you

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
might be sending to her is
that having a mother being

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:84%
a woman who's passionate
about her work

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and giving back to the
world is really important.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it might inspire
in her-- I grew up

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
with a mom who was incredibly
passionate about her work,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
traveled a lot, left
home quite a bit.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
it was hard as a kid,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it's given me
permission to follow my dreams.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can't think of
any better role model

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
than to have a woman who, yeah,
sometimes she wasn't around.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.254 align:middle line:84%
But she also, when she
was home, she really was--

00:26:30.254 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Present.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: There.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I get this
permission to say, you know,

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.604 align:middle line:84%
there's my mom
following her dreams.

00:26:38.604 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you really
take that essence away?

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Like later, I did.

00:26:42.592 --> 00:26:44.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:26:44.005 --> 00:26:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Probably, in
high school, I would say.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:84%
In high school, I kind
of started to get it.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had better
decision making abilities then.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: I think
that she also,

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
as an entrepreneur and a
woman charting her own course,

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
showed me the example
of there aren't

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:90%
rules of how you have to do it.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
follow the party line.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And like feel free to veer off
any time and do your own thing.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I am sure that's
what your passing along

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.848 align:middle line:90%
to your daughter.

00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm hoping so.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.785 align:middle line:84%
OK, so can we get some
advice on a budget?

00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Oh, yeah.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really like
the word budgeting.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.459 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: I think of
budgeting sort of like dieting.

00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Any time you start
something-- So budget to me

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
has a connotation with
restriction and deprivation.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I like to use
the term spending plan.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it
feels expansive,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and budget feels
like shut it down.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And it feels not fun at all.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And so spending plan to
me-- organizing our lives

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
around what we value
is really important.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So money is a stand
in for what we value.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to get
on track financially,

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
a really good place to start
is spending money on the things

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
we actually value, not on the
things we think we should have

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
or that our mother
told us we should have

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
or that society
thinks or whatever.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.042 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So wait.

00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:09.000 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain shoes
as something we value?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Because women and
shoes, it's a thing.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.349 align:middle line:90%
Every woman knows it.

00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We have more shoes
than we have feet.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: I think
you have to really ask

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:84%
yourself, what are the
shoes feeding in me?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.334 align:middle line:90%
I really, I'm serious right now.

00:28:21.334 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This sounds so frivolous
But the reality

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
is like, some people
have a value of beauty.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Or some people really
want to feel sexy.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And like sexiness and
sensuality is a value of theirs.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps the shoes are
meeting that particular value.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:10%
So it's not shoes.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:10%
You don't value shoes.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.500 align:middle line:10%
There's always something
deeper behind your behavior

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:10%
underneath.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so starting to
ask yourself, why am I

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.560 align:middle line:84%
spending the money on
this instead of this

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful question
instead of beating yourself up.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what the personal
finance industry does is make

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.520 align:middle line:90%
us feel bad about our choices.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
like, it can be.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:90%
There are some wonderful people.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.746 align:middle line:84%
I love my CPA, for
example But there

00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:03.212 align:middle line:84%
can be some finger wagging
and some you've been bad

00:29:03.212 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and you've been wrong
and what's wrong with you

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.869 align:middle line:84%
for not taking advantage of
compound interest, for example.

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, I think
about the-- I don't

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.535 align:middle line:84%
know where I heard this--
but the latte diet.

00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If you take out one latte
a week or two lattes a week

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, then you'll have
enough money to invest, right.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: That's
a fabulous idea.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
However, that doesn't take
into account our values.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you something,
the amount of emotional bang

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I get for my buck when
I buy a latte is huge,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
far more than if I
spent like 100 times

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:84%
more on-- let me
think about something

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.634 align:middle line:84%
I don't really care about--
like a monster truck show.

00:29:38.634 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: That's
a bad example.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But like I'm not really
into cars, for example.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't do it for me.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm really into travel.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.652 align:middle line:84%
I'm really into spending
time with friends and kind

00:29:48.652 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual experiences
and connections.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think the latte
factor is great,

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.199 align:middle line:84%
but you need to look at
the thing in your life.

00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In your life.

00:29:56.073 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: That's
like the latte.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
That really, it's like,
at the end of the day,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't actually give you
that much joy and pleasure.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the
latte actually does.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is, so
much financial advice

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is about postponement of joy
and postponement of pleasure.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And while I do think
it's really important

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to save for retirement
and I do that.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I recommend it.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.530 align:middle line:84%
There's this idea
that like we're

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
supposed to slave away and
suffer and deprive ourselves

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.935 align:middle line:84%
until we're 65 and
then we can live.

00:30:24.935 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: What's up with that?

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.991 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the beautiful
thing about the internet

00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
is that it allows
people to continue

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:84%
in-- not the workforce--
but providing their passions

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.822 align:middle line:90%
even after that.

00:30:35.822 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Which is so cool.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, both of my parents are
not anywhere near slowing down.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And same
with my grandmother's 88.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.954 align:middle line:84%
And she built a business,
and exercises every day

00:30:46.954 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and is such a great example
of just like keeping on.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so
many more new things

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:90%

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: I know.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so I
wanted to get back

00:30:53.278 --> 00:30:55.634 align:middle line:90%
to the conversation around debt.

00:30:55.634 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make sure
that I heard you correctly,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that you're not saying debt
is something that is frivolous

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:90%
because it's just a number.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that it's
something that's real.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Debt is real.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we can get
over our heads, I mean,

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.305 align:middle line:84%
completely over our heads and
lose things like homes and--

00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Absolutely.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.194 align:middle line:90%
No, it's real.

00:31:13.194 --> 00:31:13.984 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Businesses.

00:31:13.984 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It's scary.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It's scary to the extent that
we're not conscious about it.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up happening is
we do all these behaviors.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And in my own life,
it was like I bought--

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and the irony of this
is not lost on me--

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of my debt was
personal growth seminars.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.047 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:31:31.047 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: I had
this-- I was kind

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of feeding an
emotional hole in me

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that felt like I wasn't good
enough and that felt like, well

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
if I just go to
this weekend thing

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
or if I just sign up
for this $3,000 course,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
then they have an answer that
I'm going to need to fix me.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what we can do, if
you're in a lot of debt

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and it feels suffocating--
which absolutely it

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:90%
can feel super suffocating.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's real.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.104 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying, oh
it doesn't matter.

00:31:58.104 --> 00:31:58.895 align:middle line:90%
And just, you know.

00:31:58.895 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't creditors
come after you

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:90%
when you have collections?

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And people--
they lose their homes.

00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:90%
They can lose their whole lives.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
important is to look

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.910 align:middle line:90%
at what am I feeding here?

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Like what is going on
underneath the surface?

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I was feeding
my desire to look perfect

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and to look like I had it
completely all together.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I did all sorts
of things feeding that.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, nobody
knows what they're doing

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and nobody has it all together.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I can just let that
go, things began to change.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.424 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped spending
money on things

00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to fill
a void that was never

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be filled
by stuff or courses.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a
great way of saying it.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.965 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we don't really
need all that stuff.

00:32:43.965 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: No.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And in 2010, I
decided I was going

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
to move out of New York
City, sell all my stuff,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and go on a road
trip indefinitely.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I bought a Prius and
I got rid of all my stuff.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And all my stuff was just
in the back of the Prius.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have really
never felt more free

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.667 align:middle line:84%
than having so little
needs financially that way.

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's neat.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: But so
expansive and so abundant

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of different ways.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.628 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

That is really neat.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And how long did you go
on the road trip for?

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: It was 10 months.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.956 align:middle line:90%
And where'd you journey to?

00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: All over.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:90%
It was all over North America.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So I did 34,000
miles, 41 states,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and a couple provinces
thrown in there.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And what'd you learn?

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:90%
What'd you gain?

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Oh my gosh.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.157 align:middle line:90%
It's a big thing.

00:33:31.157 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But I fell in love with my
fiance, which was really fun.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.256 align:middle line:84%
I invited him on a whim to
come with me and he said yes.

00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But only it was supposed
to be for five days.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But that ended up
being 10 months.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I learned about the freedom
of simplicity and really what

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.520 align:middle line:84%
tuning into what
we actually-- OK,

Or we-- whatever.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It's always connected with an
emotional desire that we have.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what I found is that
if we can meet those emotional

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.600 align:middle line:84%
needs other places,
then we can just

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:84%
use money for what
it's actually for,

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.017 align:middle line:84%
which is creating opportunities,
creating choices in our life,

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe creating some experiences.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Providing
for other people.

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Providing,
security, being

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:90%
generous, all of those things.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.844 align:middle line:84%
But stop using it for the
stuff that it's not really for.

00:34:20.844 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You hit a
big never there.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.426 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole emotional
shopping component.

00:34:24.426 --> 00:34:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Oh, yeah.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's an addiction.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:90%
And it fills a void.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
filling the void, actually.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's a full addiction.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It can
be a full addiction.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.691 align:middle line:10%
And there actually is-- I
mean, if somebody's listening

00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:38.290 align:middle line:10%
and they feel like,
ooh, that might be me.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:10%
There actually are
12 step programs,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.350 align:middle line:10%
which are phenomenal and free.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.891 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, we're going
to take a look at Kate's video

00:34:43.891 --> 00:34:45.894 align:middle line:84%
on her book, "Money:
A Love Story."

00:34:45.894 --> 00:34:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Hi,
I'm Kate Northrup,

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and I have a new book coming out
called "Money: A Love Story."

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:10%
In the book, you're going to get
practical strategies to get out

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:10%
of debt faster than you
ever thought possible,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.380 align:middle line:10%
to reorganize your life so
you feel abundant every day

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:10%
no matter what so that
you can spend your most

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:10%
precious asset, which
is actually your time,

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:10%
doing exactly the
things that you want

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:10%
to do so that your
life is exactly the way

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:10%
you want it to be.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I've designed a bunch
of great exercises

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in the book to take you
through the process of not

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:84%
only the theoretical aspect
of all this money stuff,

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
but really the practical
stuff so you can take it home.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of my favorites
are setting up a Money

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
for Me Account, which
is going to teach you

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:84%
how to decrease your
spending in a way that

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
feels really luxurious
and abundant.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Another one of my favorites
is the Feeling Good Financial

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Planning Process, which
is going to teach you

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
how to align your whole
financial life with what

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
feels good to you
as opposed to you

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.760 align:middle line:90%
trying to fit into statistics.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.129 align:middle line:84%
The thing about money
is that none of us

00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:49.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able to go
through life without dealing

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So we might as well make the
whole thing a loving process.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:10%
I know this personally
because I got

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:10%
into and out of $20,000
worth of credit card debt

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.870 align:middle line:10%
using the exact
strategies that I'm

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:10%
going to teach you in the book.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm so excited for
you to get this book

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.145 align:middle line:10%
and for you to create
your own money love story.

00:36:07.145 --> 00:36:12.954 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.954 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Two things that
we most likely did not

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:84%
learn from our parents is
telling the truth around money.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.902 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
I spoken to that

00:36:19.902 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:84%
go back to that moment
where there was secrecy,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
it was never talked
about at the dinner table

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:90%
if there was a dinner table.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was we have
more than we say,

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:90%
or we have less than we say.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:84%
What is that truth
around money thing?

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, it's weird.

00:36:34.535 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It is this cultural
assumption that it's not

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:84%
OK to talk about
it, and that is what

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.497 align:middle line:84%
happens around dinner
tables across America,

00:36:41.497 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure across the world.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It came out
of the Depression.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.448 align:middle line:84%
And just this whole idea
it's not OK for other people

00:36:47.448 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:90%
to know how much we make.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Our kids shouldn't know.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.693 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just like strange.

00:36:50.693 --> 00:36:51.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Because
everybody's dealing

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:90%
with money on a daily basis.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
most powerful things

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:84%
we can do to just
change that legacy

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is to tell ourselves the
truth starting out with that.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in a lot
of debt, I literally

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:90%
had no idea how much it was.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't look.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't look.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared because I
had so much self judgment

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:90%
that I just didn't even look.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of just
treaded water with my nose

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:90%
barely above the surface.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I got some
support around this,

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.514 align:middle line:84%
because I realized
I have been saying

00:37:23.514 --> 00:37:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to change this
behavior for a while now

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not actually
changing the behavior.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:90%
So I knew I needed help.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So I got a financial
advisor on the phone with me

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
who is really loving
and super helpful.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And she just asked me
a series of questions.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how much do you spend
and how much do you make

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and what's this account and
what's happening over here.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And with her holding my
hand and not judging me,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I wrote everything out.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had been so
terrified to do that,

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:84%
but what ended up
happening is just

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:84%
knowing the truth
felt so freeing.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: It felt
so much more freeing

00:37:52.586 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:84%
than being in the gray zone
and being in avoidance, which

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was like this constant like--
you know those little no-- we

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:90%
call them no-see-ums in Maine.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what you call them.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But they're like
tiny little bugs.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.249 align:middle line:84%
And they make this
noise like eee.

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So having money stuff that
you're not dealing with

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.819 align:middle line:84%
is like a constant little
no-see-um in your ear

00:38:10.819 --> 00:38:11.485 align:middle line:90%
that's like eee.

00:38:11.485 --> 00:38:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's really annoying.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you less able to be
present with the things you're

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
actually doing-- with your
kids, with your career,

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
with those things.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you actually
tell yourself the truth,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I found I was like, oh.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Well now I know where I am.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And I know where I want to go.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.599 align:middle line:84%
And if I know where I am
and where I want to go,

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I can actually get there.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.104 align:middle line:84%
Because beforehand, it
was just total gray zone.

00:38:33.104 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
need a plan though,

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.050 align:middle line:84%
but you can accept
the plan easier

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:84%
after you've gotten
to a place of truth.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.321 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And telling
the truth about something

00:38:40.321 --> 00:38:43.490 align:middle line:84%
we feel shame around is
one of the quickest ways

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:84%
to lighten that shame and
bring it out into light.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.009 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out
of ten, when you

00:38:49.009 --> 00:38:50.550 align:middle line:84%
tell yourself the
truth and then when

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you tell somebody safe
who's going to love you,

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.729 align:middle line:84%
it's way less worse than you
thought it was going to be.

00:38:55.729 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's very true.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It's actually very freeing.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.178 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, so freeing.

00:38:59.178 --> 00:39:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so the other thing
is this conversation that money

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is a laborious, deep,
stressful conversation.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:84%
How do we make it fun if we know
there's lots of debt happening

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.989 align:middle line:90%
and nothing coming in?

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: So there are so
many different ways to make

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:84%
dealing with your money
fun and pleasurable.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.593 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the main ways
that I got myself out of debt.

00:39:18.593 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like the
whole finance conversation

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.122 align:middle line:90%
was really heavy.

00:39:23.122 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A burden.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And it felt
complicated, honestly.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And it felt depressing.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like deprivation
and beating myself up.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- it felt icky.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't do it.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, if
something's fun, you'll do it.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I just needed to
rewire the whole experience.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So one thing I did is I
renamed bills Invoices

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:90%
for Blessings Already Received.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So it became-- paying my bills
became a practice in gratitude,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because it was like,
oh, how awesome.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I get to pay Time Warner
Cable for the fact

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that I have wireless internet
at my apartment 24 hours a day

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.672 align:middle line:84%
and I can connect to
the entire planet.

00:39:58.672 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I am super grateful for that.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And guess what-- we all signed
up for the bills that we have.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, we swiped our credit
card and we opted in.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And so practicing
gratitude around that

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.960 align:middle line:84%
is one way to make
it feel way better.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Having a financial
freedom date or whatever

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.400 align:middle line:10%
you want to call
it, you can call it

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:10%
a money date, where you get
together with your spouse

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.110 align:middle line:10%
or on your own and create some
accoutrements around that.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.220 align:middle line:10%
So actually maybe have a
delicious beverage in a wine

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:10%
glass, play some
great music, have

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.280 align:middle line:10%
flowers, put on cute
underwear, red lipstick,

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:10%
whatever it takes.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And make it fun.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
I thought was really

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:84%
genius somebody
I worked with did

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is she had her spending plan and
her spreadsheet where she would

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.450 align:middle line:84%
track all her
numbers each month.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And she renamed every
category for the goddess

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.250 align:middle line:90%
that rules that category.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So instead of putting
her home expenses down,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:84%
she called that
category Vesta, who

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.261 align:middle line:84%
is the goddess of
home and the hearth.

00:40:53.261 --> 00:40:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And so she created
this whole spiritual practice

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
around tracking her numbers so
she felt like she was communing

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.170 align:middle line:84%
with the goddess instead
of doing a spreadsheet.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How much is Athena
spending on underwear?

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:03.984 align:middle line:90%
How much is--

00:41:03.984 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: How fun is that?

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How much is Aphrodite
spending at Victoria's Secret?

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Exactly.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
we can do these--

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: And then it
becomes this whole other things

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.326 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't
have to be drudgery.

00:41:12.326 --> 00:41:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, it can be as
simple as playing a great song

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:90%
while you track your receipts.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It can put you into
an altered state.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Exactly.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And make you
a happier person.

00:41:20.324 --> 00:41:22.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NORTHRUP: Yeah, because how
you do it is what you get.

00:41:22.656 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The more fun you
have doing something,

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.340 align:middle line:84%
the more it kind of opens
the passageway for abundance

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:90%
to flow.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.445 align:middle line:84%
Money is a stand in
for what we value.

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A stand in
for what we value.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.372 align:middle line:90%
I get that now.

00:41:32.372 --> 00:41:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Cool.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.836 align:middle line:90%
>>NORTHRUP: Thank you.

00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:36.810 align:middle line:90%
This was a pleasure.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fun.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:38.191 align:middle line:90%
You're a lot of fun, too.

00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I love how the energy that
you lighten up around money.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the new
generation of money.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:43.769 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:41:43.769 --> 00:41:44.560 align:middle line:90%
