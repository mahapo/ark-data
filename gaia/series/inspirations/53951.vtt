00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So what if you were able to
rearrange the beliefs that you

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
were raised with, and actually
gain control of the memories

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:90%
that you have of your childhood?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can even
choose new memories.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is
Doctor Eldon Taylor.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
He is the foremost authority
on preconscious learning

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and research.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
He had a very successful
criminology practice

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
using hypnosis and subliminal
technology in the late '80s.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And now he is the creator of the
patented InnerTalk technology

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that teaches us how
to master the mind.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
So, welcome.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.759 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDON TAYLOR: It's,
indeed, my pleasure.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here today.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is my
favorite topic, the mind

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and how we do the things we do.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so fascinated
by your background.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't mind talking
a little bit about it.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
When you were a
criminologist, what

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
did you do when you were asking
the questions of the people

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:90%
that had committed these crimes?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to
the truth from them?

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I'll digress, first.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.484 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The word
is criminalist.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.885 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: And the difference
is I was in the field.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:10%
I spent my days perhaps running
lie detection examinations,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:10%
conducting a forensic
hypnosis session,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:10%
supervising an investigation.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
That was how I spent
my day as opposed

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to in the theory of
penology or criminology,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:90%
which is a distinction.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.314 align:middle line:84%
And of course, part of my
job was to learn the truth.

00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you work for the
FBI, or the CIA, or everyone?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Or were you independent?

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.892 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: At times I
carried on examinations

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
for a number of
different agencies.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
But I had my own practice.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And with that practice we had
a private investigation agency.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had some
really good people,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
like Billy Bayshore, who headed
the Nixon detail in '76-- '76

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:90%
to '78.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
successful practice.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lot
of private clients.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And we did work for
agencies as well.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:10%
But, to come back to your
question, since part of my job

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:10%
was how do I get you
to tell me the truth?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though, perhaps, a
device such as a lie detection

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
examination, a polygraph,
or what we call a PSE,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:90%
had been used.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.407 align:middle line:84%
And I were to say
to you, Lisa Garr,

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:90%
you're not telling me the truth.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
I see deception indicated here.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
What is it you're
not telling me?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to get you
to confess a crime that,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
for all intent and
purposes, may put you away

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.364 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time?

00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's
important, therefore,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand why we do what we
do, what the motivation can be,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that
we need in order

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
to assuage the feelings of
guilt that we might have

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
as a result of doing
what we did do.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So we have to give you an out.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to give
you a way to feel

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that you're safe
about what you do.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of that takes
on the complexity of how

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
you learn what you've
learned, why you acted out,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and that part has been, for
all intent and purposes,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the subject of everything I've
wanted to study in my life--

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
how the mind works.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do what we do?

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:90%
How do we get control of it?

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly
today, how do we

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
manifest the
potential that rests

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
within every single one of us,
for so much beauty and glory

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:90%
and pleasure in life?

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see your through
line, through everything,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is your fierce
seeking of the truth.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: True.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a compliment,
I appreciate that.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I love how you
get to it, though.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So, back when we had
these criminals creating

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
these crimes, you would go
in and use different types

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
of technologies in order
to have them feel safe,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:90%
to give you the truth.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
When you did that, you
used, what, subliminals?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Not subliminals, you
used hypnosis, right,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:90%
during that time?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We used hypnosis
on a forensic basis

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:90%
typically with a witness.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could tell
you lots of case stories

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
where maybe it wasn't a
witness, it was a victim.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Or it was a perpetrator.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But hypnosis is not
something the courts like.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to use
hypnosis, what you use it for

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is to gain information,
evidence, evidence that

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:90%
can be independently verified.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I know you like stories.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.745 align:middle line:90%
And I love to tell stories.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you one, OK?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I'm
sure some great ones.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.958 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I'll give
you an example.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a defense attorney
and his private investigator

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
reach out to me and ask me if
I would conduct a lie detection

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
test and do forensic hypnosis
on a subject in the prison

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
system, convicted of the
homicide of his mother.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Now he was convicted
through his own admission.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
According to him,
he had plead guilty

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
because they had
made a deal with him.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And the deal was he
wouldn't do hard time.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, this was
a very brutal homicide.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of things
that went on in this case that

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
are questionable
by way of how it

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:90%
was handled by law enforcement.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Be that as it may, when I
sat with this young man,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about his
lie detection test, which

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
he'd taken, and had been
used to get him to plead.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that it was
an illegal lie detection test.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It had been administered, a
device using only two needles.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're not reliable,
and situational stress

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and other things
can complicate that.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:90%
So I gave him the test.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:90%
He passed the test.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Meaning he
was telling the truth?

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.908 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: He was
telling the truth,

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that he had not
killed his mother.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
That was the only issue relevant
to the lie detection test.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
No other issues involved.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So then we did
forensic hypnosis.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.895 align:middle line:84%
During the hypnosis,
I had him go back

00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:31.962 align:middle line:84%
to that evening in
question and describe

00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:90%
everything that had happened.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, he had been at a party.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the party,
he'd had alcohol,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:90%
he'd had some marijuana.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%
He'd done some drugs.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And he'd left the party.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.091 align:middle line:90%
He was lit.

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not in his right mind.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
On his way to his
home, he passed

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
through a park, a public park.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And there were law
enforcement officers

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
in the park that just pulled
in as he was coming through.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:90%
So he hid.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And he watched them
search the trash in two

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or three different
places in the park.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Then he went home, and
there he found his mother.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
She'd been beaten to
death, sexually brutalized.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And in his stupor state
he called law enforcement

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and then went outside and
sat down on the porch.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Law enforcement arrived.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
His fingerprints
were over everything.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:84%
He'd handled material
in the scene.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
As I say, he was given
this lie detection test.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:90%
He plead out on it.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:90%
He's in prison.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
out of this story that

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is going to acquit
him, it is can we

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
verify the time in the park
that the law enforcement

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
officers searched that garbage?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the logs
of the police department,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
we were able to identify the
officers that were there,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
what time they were there,
how long they were there.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was no possible way he
could have committed the crime

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.086 align:middle line:90%
and been there to witness that.

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:90%
The conviction was overturned.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:90%
He was released.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And subsequently,
the real perpetrator

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:90%
was identified and punished.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you have, the
forensic aspect of hypnosis

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.835 align:middle line:84%
is to gain additional
information.

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Knowledge, right.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The victim
says, it was a big gun.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
But under hypnosis they're
able to describe everything

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We have so many things that
go on that we're not aware of,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that are stored in
our unconscious, that

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
are available to us when
we enter into these altered

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
The subliminal you asked about
wasn't designed for that.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
When you have a lie
detection practice,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
a percentage of the
individuals you're going to see

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
are going to come in and
practice a countermeasure.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And when they practice
a countermeasure,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have a thumb
tack in their shoe.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they've been told
tense all your muscles

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:90%
during the relevant question.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever else.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Even when you see
the countermeasure,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
you're an examiner.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You're restricted to
what your charts say.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.417 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You could
say, look, I don't

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:84%
want you moving when I
ask you the question.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's a limit
to how often you're

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.081 align:middle line:90%
going to go on doing that.

00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
That leads to what we
call an inconclusive.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
chart that I can say

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you're deceptive or
non-deceptive in.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You can also have the
innocent individual

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that is just so
terrified that you're

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
going to point at them
that they bring so

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
much situational
stress to the scenario

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can have
an inconclusive.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea
behind the subliminal

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
was I had heard the LA
Police Department had indeed

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
used a subliminal in preparation
for the '84 Olympics,

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in case there were a
terrorist abduction scenario.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, explain
the subliminal

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:90%
so people can know what it is.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: OK, well we're talking
about an audio message, set

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%

masked in such a way

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that you consciously
don't recognize them

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:90%

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't discern them.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you catch what sounds
like a voice somewhere,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's masked in what we think
of as maybe white noise, which

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.102 align:middle line:84%
would be the sound of--
well pink noise is going

00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to be your furnace,
your air conditioner.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:90%
White noise, the ocean.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Think of it this way,
a frequency on a blackboard

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:90%

So I have lines that move.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are
different frequencies.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%

things that I tell you to do

00:11:31.138 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
is take advantage of

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:84%
You can simply take
positive messages.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:84%
We all want affirmations
because if we use affirmation,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
the evidence is strong that
they can empower us to overcome

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things,
from addictions

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
to self imposed limitations.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
with affirmations

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
is they come from
the outside in.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So you know that
affirmation, I am good.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.955 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And
pretty quick, maybe

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
my sentry, conscious

Good at what?

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember when?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to get this
mitigation coming back

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that undermines, undercuts
the power of that affirmation.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So look, let's assume
that you wanted

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to create some
positive affirmations.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You want to be more
confident about something.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was great until

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, why are we meeting
at Kingsbury Hall, William?

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Well because Black Chemists

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and I want them all to be there.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I'm President of

Well that was like some
800 or 900 chemists.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Honestly, I
drove there that day,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, I got out of my car.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
my-- I was so tied up.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I was shaking so much, all over.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I took my coat off, put
my jacket inside the car,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
took the sleeves of
my long sleeve shirt,

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
went around my tire like this.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So it would support a
story I had a flat tire

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't make it.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And I drove away.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's the honest truth.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: As serendipity,
synchronicity,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
or what you would have
it, has it maybe a month,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
six weeks later, I
had an entertainer

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
ask me to create something
for performance anxiety.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:90%
So I created a program.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do this, you
choose a mutually exclusive

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
profile to the
profile that-- say

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
my profile of absolute
terror about public speaking.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
What would it be if I was
just completely confident

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.024 align:middle line:90%
about speaking?

00:14:15.024 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you do.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything is all
positive, all right?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So I created the profile,
mixed in this program.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And the way we did it
was, you know, you just

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:90%
simply use the audio illusion.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You put it on top of the
waves so that you can hear it,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and then you put some
music over the top of that.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%

continue the story,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
so I grabbed this program,
this audio program.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.222 align:middle line:84%
And as it was, that
weekend I had reservations

00:14:54.222 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:90%
at a cabin in a national park.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So I raced down
there, got in late, thought,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd better play this

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
off on Monday to
this entertainer.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So I put it on the
stereo and I sat back.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was going through some
notes and I fell asleep.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And I had a dream.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.525 align:middle line:90%
And in the dream--

00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You created
this program?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --a real
life revivification

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:84%
of an experience I

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be a singer.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be
a Wayne Newton.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd watched, you
know, "Hit Parade."

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm dating myself.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I would learn the music.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd sing it
over and over again.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Well I'd learned this
song, "Vaya con Dios."

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And I sung it and sung it.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Well we were at a family
reunion up in Wyoming.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's side of the
family, very white collar.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
My father's side,
very blue color.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
always get along.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's about to
be this disagreement

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
when my mother puts me out
in the middle of the floor

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and says something
like, my son sings.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.632 align:middle line:84%
Well here are these austere
adults in this huge room,

00:16:07.632 --> 00:16:08.942 align:middle line:90%
and I'm terrified.

00:16:08.942 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And my voice breaks up.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I run out
of the room in tears.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can-- you know,
I had the dream.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I sit straight up in bed--
my mother's crossed over

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
at that point-- and I look
up, thanks, Mom, thanks.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know where the fear came
from about public speaking.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I had that terror grip me.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But when we uncover
these kinds of things,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.265 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's kind
of like-- you know,

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:37.792 align:middle line:84%
there's a bogey man
in your bedroom.

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And we've all had that.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And we're too scared

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So we call out, mom and dad
come, throw the light on.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's how we through our clothes
over the door or the closet,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.774 align:middle line:90%
or over the chair.

00:16:50.774 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Something's

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.106 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, you

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
They turn the light off.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.386 align:middle line:84%
They close the
door and walk away,

00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%
the bogey man's still there.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
have power over you

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
anymore because you
know what it was.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Well see, that event, using that
performance anxiety program,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
did the same thing for me.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was like, wow, my
own uncovering, you see.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So taking these affirmations,
and using these affirmations,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
getting them from
the inside out,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
we don't have this conscious

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%
So what, back to our story--

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --what I wanted to do

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.995 align:middle line:84%

00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:36.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so this
is what you did

00:17:36.595 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:90%
with people who were in prison?

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%
This is what you did with--

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.205 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well we began--
we were using it strictly

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:43.455 align:middle line:90%
in the lie detection scenario.

00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And it worked really well.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact
of the matter is

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
anyone will tell
you confessions come

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
in the third hour
of interrogation.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're ever arrested,
you're held in somewhere,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.644 align:middle line:84%
you're going to cool your
heels for a long time

00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
before the heavyweight comes
in and starts the guns.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.139 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see, OK.

00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But
utilizing the program,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
we would have deceptive
indicated charts,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and the people were
confessing right off the bat.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I almost felt like saying,
whoa, wait, hold it.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.682 align:middle line:90%
I'm paid by the hour.

00:18:11.682 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But, fact of the matter
is, it worked so well

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that a number of agencies
started to use it.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the county
attorney advised us

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
it probably wasn't a good
idea without informed consent.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But about that time, a friend
of mine at the Utah State Prison

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
asked me, could we use
it for rehabilitation?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Could it be used to lower
hostility and aggression?

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we went out to
the Utah State Prison,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and we ran the first of its
kind, double blind study

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in a prison system--

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --with
real tight protocols.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And we employed the technology.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:52.781 align:middle line:84%
And it was so successful that
the prison system cloned it

00:18:52.781 --> 00:18:54.155 align:middle line:84%
throughout their
entire facility.

00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And other prison
systems adapted it.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it hasn't
been a month ago

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a radio
interview, and the woman

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that was talking to me asked
me about the prison systems.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And she's, you know,
I was at Chowchilla

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:90%
when we copied it there.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness!

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So this was a
subliminal program that

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
reduced the recidivity
rate of the--

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The program was
designed-- see what we did,

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
we went in the
prison system, again

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
we used some very sophisticated
psychometrics, including

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.667 align:middle line:90%
the MMPI.

00:19:23.667 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The Minnesota

>>LISA: OK.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We used, for any

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
we used the Fowler

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
adapted for an
incarcerated environment.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But when we came back
with all the data,

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:90%
we didn't learn anything.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The only thing--
I mean, we knew we

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
had high scores in self
and social alienation.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So the inmate had
low self esteem.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But he also held you in low
self regard, all of society.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do it
to you before you do it

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to me was kind of a
model to think about.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:84%
However, when we spoke with
them, I had my own epiphany.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was a major
life changer for me.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when you sat and talked
with the inmates, what I heard

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
was repeated stories
that went something like,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
ah but for the grace
of God there go you.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, listen, my
daddy was an alcoholic,

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%
my mommy was a prostitute.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The neighbor boy main lined
me when I was eight years old.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, usually those stories
were totally exaggerated.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they could be true.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.106 align:middle line:84%
But when they were
true, you could

00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
have two siblings come
out of the same home.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
One was a physician in
a teaching hospital,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and one's in the prison.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.565 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So it was a
matter of their choice.

00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:42.236 align:middle line:84%
It was how they-- when we
saw this blame function,

00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%
because that's what it was.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It was an ability to displace
responsibility through blame.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not my fault.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Ah, but for the grace of God.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Society's placed me here.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, I deserve better.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
When we saw this
blame function, we

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
decided that the best way to
deal with that, the only way

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that,
was forgiveness.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Now mind you, this is
back in the very early

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
'80s, before any
of the literature

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:90%
that we all see today.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.062 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have the
inmates forgive themselves.

00:21:16.062 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Now there were some
folks that thought about,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.777 align:middle line:84%
what kind of a
crazy idea is that?

00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, absolutely.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.276 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But you
know what we did

00:21:23.276 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is we took a solid set
of positive self esteem

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
affirmations, we locked
them up, with what today we

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
call the forgiveness set.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I forgive myself, I forgive
all others, I am forgiven.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you're
ability to displace

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
responsibility,
to blame, is gone.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.424 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That simply?

00:21:44.424 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That simply.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.839 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:48.765 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And if you then begin

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
you're positive that

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that you can do things, and
they come from the inside out--

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --so that you don't

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
mitigating, undermining him
by continually attacking.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know, you open your eyes

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and say, you know, life's great.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I love living.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
use this technology

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
to actually reduce the amount
of repeat offenders, right?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's right,
it interrupted recidivy.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.776 align:middle line:84%
But it lowered
hostility and aggression

00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in the prison system.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:90%
It increased reflectivity.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And that was the real home run.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.805 align:middle line:84%
And it was so successful
that our first study, it's

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:90%
all volunteers.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.875 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the youth
offenders facility,

00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.265 align:middle line:90%
these were first time offenders.

00:22:32.265 --> 00:22:35.781 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
What we had there, with
this group of people,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
might have been
different somewhere else.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.234 align:middle line:84%
So we started moving
libraries out, elsewhere.

00:22:44.234 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were
some inmates that

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
weren't interested
in forgiveness.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe rehabilitation,
but is there

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:90%
something like body building?

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.495 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me body build?

00:22:54.495 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Can I
build big muscles?

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did,
little by little,

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is we began to build additional
titles around this idea.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:90%
So you wanted to lose weight?

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Fine, here's a
weight lost program.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You want to body build?

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Fine, here's a body
building program.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But at the core of
all these issues

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is this self esteem and
this forgiveness principal.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel so strongly
about that, Lisa.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.195 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, for
four or five years,

00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
big career change
I told you for me.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Because my own
epiphany was, boy, I'm

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
holding a lot of hostility
and aggression in myself.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm blaming a lot of folks.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd left home early.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I blame my father for this.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I blame this.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I had a chip on my shoulder.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was angry
and I was paranoid.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.655 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
real epiphany to me

00:23:45.655 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to discover that
my mentation wasn't

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.445 align:middle line:90%
that much different than theirs.

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:54.152 align:middle line:84%
I had only found a socially
acceptable way to act it out.

00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:55.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, in a different way.

00:23:55.485 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the same stories--

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So, as I'm
out lecturing on this,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and trying to walk my talk,
and change and practice things,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
it became clear to me that
if it's that important,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
it ought to be free.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And so 17 years ago I
made it available free.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It's free to this
day on my website.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Your listening audience could
go there and download it today.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a program that's been
used by Fortune 500 executives,

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:84%
not just inmate

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.085 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: You name the gamut.

00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: "Forgiving

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
the beginning place.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take
control of your life,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you want to own
your own franchise,

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
you can't keep giving away your
power to somebody by blame.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's what blame does.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't do anything about
it, it's not my fault.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.135 align:middle line:84%
And that stops you from
taking responsibility.

00:24:53.135 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And taking
responsibility

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest key that
you've found, right?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It is a huge one.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But to me,

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be responsible

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.902 align:middle line:84%
that I have the power

00:25:08.902 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not necessarily
the past, but from here

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.669 align:middle line:90%

00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's in the
past is in the past.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's lots
of things that we

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
deal with in life
where we have choices

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:90%
that we choose not to make.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:90%
So let me-- another story.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, all right.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Wait, just to wrap that one up.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You did create
forgiveness programs

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
in the prison systems, which
I think is an incredible--

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Correct.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --incredible thing
to say and to have done.

00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:40.045 align:middle line:84%
And you impacted the youth,
and probably into generations

00:25:40.045 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even
know of right now.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So that is a wonderful
thing to say.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a--

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Thank you.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.101 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --a great thing to say.

00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, so continue on.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.593 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So, all
right, we're talking

00:25:48.593 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
about self responsibility
and taking in all scenarios.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I moved my offices to Las
Vegas, Nevada at a point.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in Las Vegas,
and for the first time

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I go to the post office.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a routine I'm
going to do every day,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:90%
go to the post office.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Not a big deal, I've been
doing that for years, but not

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:90%
in Las Vegas.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Not in this particular
post office on Pecos,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to all my friends that
might still be there.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.886 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the post
office, and it's

00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
an absolutely
hostile environment.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody is grouchy,
nasty, it's hot, it's slow.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:90%
The clerks take too much time.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.664 align:middle line:84%
And the clerks are worse
than the customers.

00:26:29.664 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And by
the time I walk out

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
of there it's like, I'm
just not going to do this.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send my secretary
to do it, which isn't very self

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:90%
responsible, is it?

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided
I'd do is every day

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.237 align:middle line:90%
I would go to the post office.

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going there
and listen to all this,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go in and I'm
going to be warm, cheerful.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
big smile on my face.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to greet everybody.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.544 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do my best to
change this environment.

00:26:59.544 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you the truth,
now, the first few days

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I did that, I walked
out feeling like I

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
was a real oaf,
one stupid dummy.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.554 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people in
that post office,

00:27:10.554 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I know there were
some that wanted

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to call folks that had white
sacks to put me in, you know?

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But I promise you this,
before 30 days had passed,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I could walk into
that post office

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.765 align:middle line:90%

Everything had changed,

responsibility in your own life

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.895 align:middle line:84%

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%

to these inmates, and so forth.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But when did you turn
this into something

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that was really useful
for positive affirmations?

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Or using the mastery of the

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about earlier?

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, again,
my epiphany, Lisa,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
was when I realized that-- and I
don't say this with any pride--

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I listen to a story, and
I thought of an incident

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I was in where I was
driving down the highway

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and there were two people
in the ditch wrestling.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
One of them was a law
enforcement officer.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I threw the brakes on,
got out of the car.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.473 align:middle line:84%
He was arresting a man,
stopping a man, who'd

00:28:34.473 --> 00:28:36.056 align:middle line:84%
attempted to commit
a burglary-- well,

00:28:36.056 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:90%
he had committed the burglary.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
He was fleeing the burglary
from a neighbor's home.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It was an off duty officer.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow, the perpetrator,
was a pretty fit fellow.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And he had done some damage.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And I was angry.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I cuffed this person,
I took the back of his cuffs

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and cranked him over like
this, which would kneel you.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I don't like to
admit is that it felt good.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I recognized
that I had that within me,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there
wasn't a lot of difference

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:90%
between the inmate and myself.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because the
anger took over?

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The anger
had just taken over.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It was all about anger.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I had found a
socially acceptable way

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to act out.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Sublimation.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So, at that point in my life
I wanted to make a change.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:90%
I decided I had to change.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
that's maybe why

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I was his paranoid
and suspicious of

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
people, as why nothing
in my life worked.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my practice worked.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I had fancy new
cars, I had property.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But my personal
life was shambles.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nothing in my
personal life worked, nothing.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:90%
So I decided I needed some help.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the tools that were
available to me, part of them

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:90%
my own, from the prison system.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Part of them was a
matter of redressing

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
how I viewed the world, changing
the context, so that I wasn't

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:84%
constantly suspicious
of everyone,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that if I would take every

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.930 align:middle line:84%

But you have to understand this,
functional magnetic resonance

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:84%
imaging has confirmed something
that Benjamin Libit showed us

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
back in the '50s that started
a whole big conversation

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in universities
around the world.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Libit watched the
brain have activity

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious before the
conscious mind did anything.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
His classical, cortical evoked
potential, the p300 wave,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and theorized that
the unconscious

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:84%
was telling the
conscious what to do.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if that's the
case, then where is free will?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, functional
magnetic resonance imaging

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:84%

watching your brain

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:84%
as you make a choice, as you

It's made for you.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You think the conscious
mind is making the decision,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.138 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the unconscious.

00:36:28.138 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So in a sort of
way, you have to think,

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, the mind is a bit
like a biocomputer.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend that's a
neurosurgeon in Hilo, Hawaii,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.020 align:middle line:90%

Jack and I've had lots of

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And Jack says, Eldon, there
is no such thing as free will.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all predetermined.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's going

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.444 align:middle line:90%
it's just going to happen.

00:36:50.444 --> 00:36:52.318 align:middle line:84%

the unconscious mind?

00:36:52.318 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, it's written
at least there, isn't it?

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:84%

it's due to your ability

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to change what's in here,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
here is a choice

And then listen to

something positive.

00:37:31.297 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%

purged in order to be heard,

00:37:35.692 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%

for a little while.

I mean we have 50,000

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But those 50,000 thoughts are
just recycling themselves.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we're
going to change them

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:84%
is to introduce a new
pattern of thinking,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:90%
a new set of thoughts.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we decide we
want, for example,

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
to add some characteristic
to who we are,

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:84%
we decide that today, going
forward, what characteristic?

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have good posture.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:90%

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:90%
is a cognitive event.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to learn
what's involved in posture.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:90%
What does good posture mean?

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Does that involve sitting
as well as standing?

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:90%
How will it impact my stride?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
little bit of homework,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and that's all cognitive.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now, let's
assume then that I've

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:90%
got a script inside my mind.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And that script somehow,
I'm not aware of.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like my fear
of public speaking.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden away.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a defense strategy.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And for a defense mechanism to
work, it has to be hidden away.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of slumped
down, because if I sat up,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle line:90%
the teacher called on me.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I didn't
know what it was.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%

on his last leg, seeks
out a physician who

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:90%

What is there for him to lose?

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So the physician admits him
to the hospital on a Friday,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
goes away for the
weekend, doesn't

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:84%

be alive come Monday.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But he enters the drug trial
and come Monday, he's improving.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they continue
the treatment protocol.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, he's up and
out of the hospital, healed.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.949 align:middle line:84%

to figure out that the

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.710 align:middle line:84%

covered, you're really not.

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all based on the
unconscious programming, right?

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, and
the problem, of course,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is we like to tell ourselves
what we want to hear.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And in that process,
we develop a lot of biases.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we internalize
these biases.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me give you, again,
a real life case, all right?

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of
research of this kind,

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and in a lot of different ways.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And so not long
ago, I'm watching

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:84%
two polar opposite networks
early in the morning.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And on one
network we have a poll.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:90%
And the poll goes this way.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Should poor taxpayers be forced
to work two jobs in order

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.165 align:middle line:84%
to be able to put their
children into private schools,

00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
since our public
schools are failing?

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: On the other
network, the same question

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.920 align:middle line:84%
is being asked, but
under this poll.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Should poor taxpayers be
forced to pay higher taxes

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to put rich kids
into private schools?

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now the question at
hand is about school vouchers.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If I happen to be a of
a very liberal bent,

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to listen to a
media that tells me over

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:50.950 align:middle line:90%
and over what I want to hear.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.720 align:middle line:90%
It reinforces that.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to listen to
the media that challenges it.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:57.677 align:middle line:90%
And vice versa is true.

00:49:57.677 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So the
first thing is I'm

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.820 align:middle line:90%
looking for a confirmation bias.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:84%
That confirmation bias
is such that I only

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:84%
want information that reinforces
what I already believe.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.090 align:middle line:84%
You give me the sound bite, and
I'll take the sound bite out

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.240 align:middle line:84%
there and beat up
you know who, who

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.410 align:middle line:84%
thinks the opposite
of what I think.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's the first part.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The second problem is,
this is a real issue.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We're adults, we all vote.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:36.760 align:middle line:84%
What on earth are we doing not
using our computers to Google,

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.720 align:middle line:84%
or going to the
library and finding out

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:90%
what's a school voucher?

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Who uses a school voucher?

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Where does the money come from?

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.970 align:middle line:84%
How does it impact
public education?

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Da, da, da, da.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So instead of making
a conscious decision,

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:84%
an intelligent decision, we're
in click-whirr mode, you know?

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.765 align:middle line:84%
We think of the
mind as operating

00:50:58.765 --> 00:51:01.700 align:middle line:84%
with system one and
system two nowadays.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.190 align:middle line:84%
System one is the
automatic mode.

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:90%
System one is fast.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.470 align:middle line:84%
System modes how 90%
of everything we do

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:84%
goes off, because system two
requires that I stop, evaluate,

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:20.450 align:middle line:84%
analyze, consider the
ramifications, and so forth.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.170 align:middle line:84%
How much of our thinking is
of that kind of thinking?

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:24.575 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Takes too much time.

00:51:24.575 --> 00:51:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Takes too
much time is right.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So we go through our
lives on automatic.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And the automatic is the script.

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And the script isn't who I am.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.620 align:middle line:84%
It's all the stuff that
I've accumulated, including

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the stuff I've taken
out of the media.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So in this little
book, "Self-hypnosis,"

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I show you that when you sit
down in front of the television

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.520 align:middle line:90%
set--

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We've actually conducted
studies to try and get you

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.160 align:middle line:84%
to stay in normal,
alpha consciousness.

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I give you a cash
reward, Lisa, if you

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
can stay in the alpha
consciousness five minutes

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:90%
in front of the television.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
flicker rate of the TV,

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:middle line:84%
you will go into
an altered state.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.990 align:middle line:84%
A state that, in
a court of law, I

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
would call a state of
hyper suggestibility,

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:84%
because the objectified
aspect of hypnosis,

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:84%
or this other state,
is a brain wave.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And that brain wave cycle is
between eight and 14 cycles

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:90%
We call it alpha.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So you're in
alpha in front of the TV.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Here comes this message, the

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to town.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking it
aboard as though you're

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.210 align:middle line:90%
in a hypnotic state.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take all
of this stuff aboard.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be, go ahead,
make my day, you know?

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Buy this, buy that.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Take this drug.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's all there.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.775 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:52:47.775 --> 00:52:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So it put this
into a theta state,

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.690 align:middle line:84%
so that we're in that
suggestible state

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:52.819 align:middle line:90%
to be able to--

00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Hyper suggestibility.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how we define
hypnosis in a court of law.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
you define television.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:59.630 align:middle line:90%
That is fascinating.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, not necessarily
internet television, though,

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.190 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have that flicker rate.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.065 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Definitely.

00:53:05.065 --> 00:53:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's true.

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And the flicker rate
it's not involved

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.710 align:middle line:90%
in internet television.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:11.251 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:90%

Chicken and the Eagle."

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:31.015 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to become
a chicken for a minute,

00:53:31.015 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I want you to

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.090 align:middle line:90%
the star of our chicken story.

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.110 align:middle line:84%
You're really an
eagle, but you're

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.100 align:middle line:90%
being raised in a chicken yard.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Your peers that guide you.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.710 align:middle line:90%
They're chickens.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:50.010 align:middle line:90%
They're good chickens.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But they, too, were
raised in a chicken yard.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And you have learned
to dig like a chicken.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.680 align:middle line:84%
You have learned to
make a hole and get down

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.690 align:middle line:90%
in it on a hot day.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You've learned to cawk
when somebody lays an egg.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:90%
You have become a good chicken.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You have been imprinted, and
that's the word in psychology,

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:16.260 align:middle line:84%
just like a young duckling
raised with chickens,

You're behaving according

00:54:22.996 --> 00:54:27.346 align:middle line:84%
But you're really a
very beautiful eagle

00:54:27.346 --> 00:54:29.480 align:middle line:90%
out in this chicken yard.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And one day, along
comes a male eagle.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And flying over the chicken
coop, he sees the female eagle.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And she's down there doing
all these chicken things.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.120 align:middle line:90%
And he circles.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.335 align:middle line:84%
He can't believe
what he's seeing.

00:54:46.335 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:10%
And his shadow falls
on the chicken yard.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.880 align:middle line:10%
One of the chickens
lets out the notice.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And they all run into
the chicken house,

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.631 align:middle line:90%
because there was an eagle.

00:54:56.631 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Well the eagle hides.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he watches the
chicken yard for days.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And one day the female
wonders just far enough away

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:84%
from the house that he's
certain he can intercept her

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:90%
before she could get back.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So down he swoops.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.490 align:middle line:90%
He cuts off her retreat.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.760 align:middle line:84%
All the other chickens
get into the chicken yard,

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:90%
into the chicken house.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.080 align:middle line:90%
He has her cornered.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The chickens inside are
all worried about her.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what are you doing
here in this chicken yard?

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:90%
And she says, what do you mean?

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.510 align:middle line:90%
He says, well you're an eagle!

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:37.222 align:middle line:84%
Look at yourself,
you're an eagle.

00:55:37.222 --> 00:55:38.780 align:middle line:90%
You're not a chicken!

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Really, she says,
thinking, what's this eagle

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:43.100 align:middle line:90%
got up his sleeve?

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.500 align:middle line:90%
What's he going to do to me?

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle says, look,
as an eagle you can soar.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.074 align:middle line:90%
You can fly higher.

00:55:52.074 --> 00:55:54.796 align:middle line:90%
You are dominion of the sky.

00:55:54.796 --> 00:56:00.238 align:middle line:84%
As an eagle, you don't belong
in a chicken yard, digging.

00:56:00.238 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You belong high, above all of
nature, accepting the wind,

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and feeling it lift you,
diving, and feeling the rays.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.720 align:middle line:84%
This just frightens
the female eagle.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.210 align:middle line:90%
But she's cunning.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:90%
She is cunning.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So she says to the male eagle,
well, if I'm really an eagle,

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.925 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going to
do me any harm, are you?

00:56:28.925 --> 00:56:30.255 align:middle line:90%
Of course not, he answers.

00:56:30.255 --> 00:56:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not here to hurt you.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to help you.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's the instance,
then you'll get out of my way.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.632 align:middle line:84%
You won't block me if I
wanted to leave, will you?

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.295 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not going to hurt you.

00:56:44.295 --> 00:56:45.745 align:middle line:90%
Look, I'll step over here.

00:56:45.745 --> 00:56:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And as he steps, she runs
to the chicken house.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Safe inside the chicken house,
she tells all her chicken

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:58.040 align:middle line:84%
friends how she
outsmarted the eagle.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.760 align:middle line:90%
And they all, wow!

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Good job!

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think about
that story for a minute,

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.405 align:middle line:84%
and you think about
yourself, were

00:57:07.405 --> 00:57:11.530 align:middle line:84%
you raised with any of the
same thing I was raised with?

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:16.010 align:middle line:84%
The negative scripting,
the chicken yard beliefs?

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.720 align:middle line:90%
You're not smart enough.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:90%
You're not old enough.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:90%
You're not good looking enough.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.356 align:middle line:90%
You're too stupid.

00:57:25.356 --> 00:57:27.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't try hard enough.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.940 align:middle line:90%
This is evil.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.222 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:57:34.222 --> 00:57:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You do understand, then, that if
you have chicken yard beliefs,

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:46.850 align:middle line:84%
those beliefs can block you from
realizing what you might want

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:52.874 align:middle line:84%
in life, and what you're
entitled to, your highest best.

of ways I can look at this.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:14.660 align:middle line:84%
The first one is if I have a
choice, as Krishnamurti said,

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.182 align:middle line:84%
it arises as a
result of confusion.

00:58:18.182 --> 00:58:19.332 align:middle line:90%

Or do I do that?

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's obviously
a state of confusion.

there isn't really a choice.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I do clearly what I should do.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.900 align:middle line:84%

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:40.070 align:middle line:84%
what is it that I should
do in all instances that

is the good of my life,
the good of humanity?

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do I
define my behavior?

How am I going to interact

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:57.330 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to help
other people in a positive?

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.470 align:middle line:84%
One message, the
bottom line message

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in "Choices and Illusions,"
as far as I'm concerned,

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.860 align:middle line:84%
comes down to
convolute the model.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.360 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be successful,
think back to John

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.290 align:middle line:84%
F Kennedy. "It's not what
my country can do for me,

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but what I could
do for me country."

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Don't think about
what is and I'm

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.760 align:middle line:90%
going to get out of the day?

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Think about what it is
you can bring to the day.

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:20.420 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
can give to the day.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I tell everybody, look, when
you wake up in the morning,

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.190 align:middle line:90%
do this simple exercise.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Begin the day by saying, as
soon as you open your eyes,

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:29.780 align:middle line:90%
thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.530 align:middle line:90%
That changes your whole mindset.

00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And put the biggest smile
you can on your face.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Fake it, you know?

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Big smile, because the
brain doesn't know you're

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.860 align:middle line:90%
faking that smile.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The brain responds to
the facial contortion

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:49.730 align:middle line:84%
by pumping on endorphins, the
body's natural opiate system.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:51.440 align:middle line:90%
So I then begin to feel good.

00:59:59.067 --> 01:00:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I had a young
woman referred to me

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:07.075 align:middle line:84%
years ago by a psychiatrist who
was on a lot of pharmacology,

01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:11.340 align:middle line:84%
a lot of medication,
because she was suicidal.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And she had, on many
occasions, mutilated herself.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So when she came into my
office the first time,

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her
intake sheets and I

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.770 align:middle line:84%
saw that her first clinician
was Milton Erickson.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:25.360 align:middle line:90%

>>TAYLOR: Now, to me, Milton
Erickson walks on water.

01:00:27.568 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%

myself, Lisa, what on earth

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.600 align:middle line:90%
am I supposed to do with this?

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%

Yeah, yeah.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Ericksonian hypnosis, and

there thinking about this.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%

something entirely different.

we're going to do what's
called brief therapy.

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.045 align:middle line:84%

This was the magic,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get a diary,
a journal, a notebook.

And every day this week, I want

you don't know.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.905 align:middle line:90%
You just do a good deed.

01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Go out of your way
to do the good deed.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's change and somebody's
short at the cash register.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's helping
somebody across the street.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Find a way to do a good deed.

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the evening,
write it in your journal.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to then think
about that good deed,

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
how it made you feel,
and how the person who

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
received the good
deed might have felt.

I don't care if they're
anonymous, even, good deeds.

But I want you to put
it in that journal.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.930 align:middle line:10%

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And everybody deserves
to live to their fullest.

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But in order for you to
recognize what your worth is,

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
you often have to do
something for someone else.

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can't fill yourself up

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:41.780 align:middle line:90%
by just patting on your back.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to help others,

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
what you find is that as
you're giving them something,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.590 align:middle line:90%
you're making a difference.

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And in making that
difference, your life matters.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, you
begin to fill yourself

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
from the inside.

01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
You begin to realize
that you're important,

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can make
the difference.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And by taking that into
your sleep every night,

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
you're priming yourself,
you're priming your psychology

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to recognize that.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.584 align:middle line:84%
This woman turned
her life around.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She did?

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I followed
or for three years.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
She was off of all
pharmacology three years out.

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
She finished her 10 weeks with
me, never cut herself again,

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.950 align:middle line:90%
never attempted suicide again.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Because she learned
that she was valuable.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how you discover how
your own worth is built.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How it's self value.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.180 align:middle line:90%
And self love, and value.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
That is, I think,
the beautiful thing

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of where you've come
from, what you've seen,

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
how you've turned
your own life around.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And then how you teach us to
do it, and teach the masses how

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to do it, which is
inspirational to me.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.825 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for being here.

01:03:58.825 --> 01:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, it's
been my pleasure.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I could talk to you and
listen to your stories forever.
