00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And we are so lucky
to be alive right now.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the access that
we have to spiritual teachings

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is just causing
more and more people

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to become more aware,
more awake, more conscious

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're in
the place in your life

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:90%
when you are done searching.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're done looking for
that thing outside yourself

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill you,
and you're really

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
ready to be truly free
and truly of contribution

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because you found
what you're looking

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.017 align:middle line:90%
for is right inside of you.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about today.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It's called awakening.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
And Arjuna Ardagh is here.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:90%
He is an awakening coach.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:90%
He's the author of eight books.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:90%
His latest is "Better Than Sex."

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And he also trains
people to become

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
facilitators of awakening.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here today.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ARJUNA ARDAGH: It's a great
pleasure to be with you again.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.043 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can we start a
little bit about your journey?

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
About your journey
into awakening.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Where were you before that?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Were you searching?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Were you found?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.345 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, Lisa, I think just
like for anybody in this way,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:90%
it starts with suffering.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.739 align:middle line:90%
That's the initial motivation.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the human journey.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was born in
London in the 1950s.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I would say into a
family where there

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
was an above average
level of suffering.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I had kind of
super enhanced suffering

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:90%
in my family.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So there was
a lot of mental illness

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and suicide and
depression in my family.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.842 align:middle line:84%
So when you're a little kid, you
don't really know about that.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Your family is your
family and then

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the outside world is
beyond your family.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
to be a teenager,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.705 align:middle line:90%
you start to individuate.

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you can look at
your family in a fresh way

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and actually you're able to
evaluate the deck of cards

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:90%
that you've been dealt.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually
at that time, when

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I got to be 14, for the
first time I realized, wow,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:90%
this is not a pretty picture.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is not normal.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I realized if I
just go along the same route

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that my fam-- that
is genetic to me,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to either commit
suicide or go crazy.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Stakes were high.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: The stakes were high.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:90%
So this was 1971 when I was 14.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.832 align:middle line:84%
So I was-- I started
to look around.

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
What's available?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
What can you do
to heal your mind?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So the obvious thing
was psychotherapy and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
psychoanalysis which both my
parents had friends in that.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I met
a few psychoanalysts

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and psychotherapists,
even at that young age,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I realized they were in worse
trouble than their patients.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
interesting as a teenager.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So I looked
around what else was there.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
There was the Hare
Krishnas, right,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.089 align:middle line:84%
going down Oxford
Street in 1971.

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.626 align:middle line:90%
With their little thing.

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
well, they were

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about
enlightenment and Krishna

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and I thought,
great, that sounds

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
like the mega dose
I'm looking for.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my
mother and I said,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I've decided I'm going to
become a Hare Krishna, which

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I thought was really good news.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
She threatened an
immediate overdose

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
if I did anything like it.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So we did a compromise
and I learned

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
transcendental
meditation, and that's

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
what really got me going.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I did that for many, many years.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
what started it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
for me was I realized my psyche
was in such enormous disrepair

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that there was no way to fix
it through traditional methods.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I was going to need to actually
transcend it completely.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was--
really got interested

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:90%
when I was a teenager.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, that
explains a lot.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
That right there, to
transcend the normal,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
even-- especially to
transcend the broken.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
That is a great
definition of awakening.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Transcendence.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.584 align:middle line:84%
And did you follow different
teachers at the time?

00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: I did.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long were
you in that process for?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.313 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Well, it was 20 years.

00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:90%
20 years.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:90%
From 14 to 34.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I was really like
a full time seeker.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain lifestyle
that goes along with that.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
There's a way you meet people.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.271 align:middle line:84%
You don't say, how
you doing anymore.

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
You say "namaste."

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And you eat certain food
and you've got a yoga mat.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
kind of thing goes

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
with being a-- rather like
being a football enthusiast.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.841 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
lifestyle goes with it.

00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Or being a surfer.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So being a spiritual seeker
there's a lifestyle involved.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:90%
So I did that very thoroughly.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I lived in India.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you could do, I did it.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so wind the clock
forward to when I was 34.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:90%
This is 1991.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, you know, this
was like a hamster in a wheel.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
That this seeking for a
state of enlightenment, which

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is a concept that everybody
was holding in their mind,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
that we've got to
enlightened, you know.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
This hamster wheel,
it was actually

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:90%
not really going anywhere.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It was just continuous movement
of working on yourself.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I met
an old man in India,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
in Uttar Pradesh, who was not
really part of that whole game.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:90%
He was very rough.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.085 align:middle line:90%
He was a retired army officer.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:90%
His name is H.W.L. Poonja.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
He was a retired army officer
who was really quite impatient

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and didn't give any
teachings at all.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The first day I met him,
there was about eight people

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
in his living room
sitting on the floor.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And he was staring into space.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
He was looking very kind
of bored and annoyed

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:90%
by the whole thing.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And so finally I
got to speak to him

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and he said, what do you want?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was a bit on
the spot because I

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
thought it was
obvious what I wanted

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
as part of this whole
spiritual seeking thing.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you want?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well,
I said to him, I

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
feel like I've been seeking
as long as I can remember.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.302 align:middle line:84%
I said, what is in
the way of finding?

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me like it
was the most utterly stupid

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
question anybody had ever
asked him in his life.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me like, he said,
what's in the way of finding?

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Seeking, of course.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can sit here in
2014 and laugh about that,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
but I tell you, at that time it
completely put me into a spin

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
anything else by that point.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
My entire life
was about seeking.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me that
seeking was the problem.

00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had one more conversation
with him that morning.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And, again, he looked
at me and he just

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
looked to me very intensely
and said, what do you want?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So I gave him the answer we'd
all been trained to give.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It was what we had been
conditioned to believe.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to be enlightened.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to be free.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.531 align:middle line:84%
No, I said, I want
to be enlightened.

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:18.509 align:middle line:90%
He said, what's that?

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought was an
interesting question

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.924 align:middle line:90%
from a teacher.

00:07:20.924 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I want to be free.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You show me the one who is
bound, and I will make it free.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I thought that's a great deal.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to show him my
ego and he'll set it free.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So I thought this was deal
of the century, you know.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to my hotel
room to try and find the ego,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.005 align:middle line:90%
And this took about a week.

00:07:48.005 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But the more I was looking
for this bound entity,

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.352 align:middle line:84%
all I could find was
thoughts, was just

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and thoughts
and thoughts.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
the thoughts stopped

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:90%
actually making any coherence.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
They were just random thoughts.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Apple pie, a movie
I saw, Mary Poppins.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.872 align:middle line:90%
Just all this stuff going on.

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you were looking
for the physical manifestation

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
of the ego?

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I don't know
what I was looking for.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.178 align:middle line:84%
What I realized was I had
no idea what's going on at,

00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I was lost.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.055 align:middle line:84%
But he had told me I had to
find this thing that was bound

00:08:24.055 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:90%
and he would make it free.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So after six days-- today
it takes like 30 seconds,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but I was a difficult case--
so after six days, I woke up.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.764 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really sleeping, but
I kind of woke up from resting,

00:08:38.764 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, a little bit
refreshed after the night.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There's something
I've got to do.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.631 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you've got to find the ego.

00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Got to find the ego.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was as though
a hand went back

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
into whatever was there
to find this thing,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and the hand just went on and
on and on and on and on forever.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And there was just space.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Just empty space.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in that moment
there was a recognition--

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
it's always been like that.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything else was made up.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There was never a thing called
an ego, it was just a concept

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.561 align:middle line:90%
created by--

00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A concept.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: --Freud's
translator, actually,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that got into the popular lingo.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
That there's never
been this thing.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.257 align:middle line:90%
There's always been this space.

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:23.715 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
clear recognition

00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that the whole
thing was made up.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
The whole seeking,
of being bound,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing was made up.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a story that
we get trapped in.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually wake up
from believing in that story,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
there is just space,
which is free,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
which is full of love,
which is full of creativity.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, I sat on
the bed and involuntarily

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
my body just laughed for
like 25 minutes straight.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It was like a joke.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Getting a joke.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.722 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A joke and the
joke was on you literally.

00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:55.429 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The joke is
on all of us, yeah.

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you mean
by Freud's translator?

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, Freud,
of course, spoke German.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think he just
used the word, ich,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:90%
which is a German word.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.665 align:middle line:84%
But when it was
translated in the--

00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a
great scholar, so I

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
might have this
completely wrong.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But what I've heard is that
it was Freud's translator

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
translating Freud to
English in the 1950s

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
after the war who
tried to translate

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
this word for individualization,
and he called it ego.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:90%
So there was ego, super ego, id.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So people now
often refer to that

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
like it's a thing, like you
got to get rid of your ego.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.207 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my ego made me do it.

00:10:32.207 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get rid
of my ego, to work

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:90%
on my ego likes it's a thing.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.214 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like it's
a physical thing.

00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But you can't
find a thing, you see.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, though
the ego can show up

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
in ways that feel
that they're solid.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.565 align:middle line:90%
Like rudeness or gregarity.

00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.659 align:middle line:84%
But rudeness is a function,
you see, it's not a thing.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:53.575 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the same way,
if I took a flashlight--

00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
if it was dark in here
and I took a flashlight

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and went like that,
you'd be tempted

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:90%
to say there is a circle.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.404 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:02.736 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But there is no
circle, it's just a flashlight

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:03.335 align:middle line:90%
going around.

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, yes,
there is egoic behavior,

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
but that's a movement.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a movement in a medium.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And the moment the
movement stops, it's gone.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So behavior
is not solid.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could create
things like hurt feelings,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:90%
but those aren't solid either.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So in this moment-- in any
moment-- that we actually

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
wake up and pay
attention to what's real,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
all of those things disappear--
the mind, the ego, the past,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the future-- all of it's
gone and there is just this.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I have to go further with this.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So take for instance
a bully, and the bully

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is bullying someone and they
physically beat up on somebody.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:90%
That's a physical manifestation.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: It's a behavior.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
If you were to do a
surgery on the person we're

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
calling a bully,
do a surgery, you

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't find any bullyness.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just behavior-- a repeated
habitual behavior pattern.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Repeated habitual
behavior patterns

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:84%
happen when we act
according to conditioning.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we
have a moment, just

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
a taste of what
is actually here,

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
which is consciousness
experiencing this,

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.175 align:middle line:90%
we break those patterns.

00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:90%
We interrupt those patterns.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.575 align:middle line:84%
Now, you-- maybe this
has happened for you.

00:12:31.575 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I can remember you
mentioned a bully at school.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I can remember people who, when
I went to school with them,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
were really-- were bullies, were
really unpleasant characters.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.364 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And a few of them
I've met in later life.

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And they've become the sweetest,
most caring, most kind, most

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:90%
philanthropic people.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So then you could ask, well,
where did the bullyness go?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't surgically removed.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It was just a behavior
pattern changed.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that space
that you talk about,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.645 align:middle line:84%
that the hand
reached back and it

00:13:01.645 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:84%
was infinite the

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever go
back to the teacher

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%

Yes.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
tell you exactly what happened.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually-- That
moment of the laughing

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:90%
happened early in the morning.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So then I had breakfast.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It was about the best
breakfast I've ever had.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything tasted fantastic.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:90%
The waiter was like an angel.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.545 align:middle line:84%
The world became
incredibly bright

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and luminous and
enjoyable simply

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because the pattern of endless
thought was interrupted.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is all that interferes
from this moment being

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:90%
paradise.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The only thing in the
way of this moment being

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
the best moment ever is this--

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Suffering.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: --pattern
of automatic thinking.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: So I went to see him.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked a question--
some kind of question

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
like, why do we,
blah, blah, blah.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said to this
person, he said,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
just a minute-- he was
very gruff-- just a minute,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.849 align:middle line:90%
he said, just a minute.

00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I have to finish my account with
this man, and pointed at me.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I have to finish my
account with this man.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:90%
So he called me forward.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And he called me forward I guess
to sit here, but I kind of just

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
kept going and ended
up kind of hugging him.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And I whispered in his ear,
I said the account's closed.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And he
knew what I meant.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:14:27.922 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The penny
had dropped, you see.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't ever turn back?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: It's not
really like that.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's-- that's
something we can talk about.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.825 align:middle line:84%
That's like a concept popular
in kind of spiritual mythology.

00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: There's this
point of no return.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.161 align:middle line:90%
People call that enlightenment.

00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very misleading
to think of it that way.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It's, in the same
way, I mean, supposing

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the sky, right?

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you're
living in London

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:90%
where there's a lot of clouds.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So you've kind of forgotten what
the sky is beyond the clouds.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
You're only used to clouds.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And one day the clouds part
and I take you outside and say,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
look, what do you see?

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.465 align:middle line:90%
And you say, ah, it's blue.

00:15:09.465 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Blue.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Maybe
it's even like one

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
of those three days
in the year in London

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
where there's no clouds
at all, and you go, wow,

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:90%
it's completely blue.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.327 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:18.327 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you could tell
a friend about this.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I went-- Arjuna
took me outside and pointed up

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was blue, you see?

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they might say,
well, but did it go back?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like that,
because once you recognize

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the blueness of the sky, you
recognize the way things are,

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and then it doesn't matter if
clouds come or they don't come.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It can't go back.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: You
realize that was not

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
a temporary change of
condition; you had an insight

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:90%
into the way things are.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking having
seen that the nature

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
is infinite, did it

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:90%
ever stop being infinite again?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The nature of consciousness
doesn't cease to be what it is.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But, of course,
you know what it's

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
like to have a relationship
and raise a child.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
I've raised two kids.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And life is difficult sometimes.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Life is challenging.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%
You go through your stresses.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's just
the human experience.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We go through our
times of being more

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
caught up the less caught up.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But the realization
that all of this

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
is happening in the context
of infinite consciousness--

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:90%
that can't be undone.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a recognition of
the way things are.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:29.549 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting,
because you mentioned earlier

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
about suffering and suffering
being the-- Buddhist philosophy

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
talks about suffering and
that the human being grapples

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with the hero's journey
and goes through this phase

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:90%
of suffering.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we need to
have that level of suffering

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
before we can get to
this level of awakening?

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we
need that contrast?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that why we create it?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: I think I needed it.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.814 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:16:59.814 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Certain ones of us do.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.485 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: I think I needed it.

00:17:02.485 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very obvious
to me, looking back,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that the difficult
circumstances of my early life

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
were absolutely a blessing
and that I wouldn't

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
be enjoying everything
I have today

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and able to give
everything I have today

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
were it not for that level
of suffering, because I coach

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and I train coaches.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.013 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: There is
nothing that anyone

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
can bring to me that
will phase me now.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.609 align:middle line:84%
However desperate people are
I go, I know what that's like.

00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it became a
blessing, you see.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It became something
that was of service.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So actually
let me talk to you

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.536 align:middle line:84%
about the awakening
coaching that you do.

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you train people
to become awakening coaches.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.802 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yes.

00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And--
because how long have

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
you been coaching
people in awakening?

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Oh, I
don't know, 25 years?

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 25 years.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So I want to ask you,
how do you train somebody

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.539 align:middle line:90%
to do what you do?

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, that's a
really good question, you see.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.246 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind, I'd
like to answer it in a slightly

00:18:04.246 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
indirect way because it's a
part of a bigger question.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the most
eternal longing and quest

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
have is to come home.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.934 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that's
the first conscious human

00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
being-- if there was
such a thing-- that

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
was the fir-- that
has always been there.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:90%
This longing to come home.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And we have an intuition
for what home is.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about awakening,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a very,
very core, intuitive longing

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
that is present in everybody.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Now this is all part of kind
of the historical development

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:90%
of the last thousands of years.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Like many, many,
many things in life,

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.055 align:middle line:84%
awakening has been
somewhat co-opted

00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
by the domination
of masculine energy.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So lots of things
in life have been

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.646 align:middle line:90%
dominated by the masculine.

00:19:08.646 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Historically.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.144 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:19:10.144 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't necessarily mean by men.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.736 align:middle line:90%
I mean by masculine energy.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:13.318 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So, for example,
international relations

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:84%
over the last
thousands of years has

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
been dominated by
masculine energy,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.031 align:middle line:84%
so we've had more
of a tendency to go

00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to war, which is a
masculine preoccupation,

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:90%
than towards diplomacy.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Or business has been very much
dominated by the masculine.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So we had a very competitive,
testosterone-driven business

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These are the
things I was thinking

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.765 align:middle line:84%
of when we were
talking about the ego.

00:19:32.765 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually a lot
of those things are simply

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.617 align:middle line:84%
attributes of
testosterone-driven behavior.

00:19:39.617 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just a hormone.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good
hormone in many ways.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual awakening has
also been very much co-opted

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:90%
by the masculine.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Which means that we
have made awakening

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
into the idea of a journey.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
A journey on a path.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Now you're on this
path and you're

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
working toward this goal.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically how
the masculine psyche works.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.789 align:middle line:84%
The masculine psyche
likes to think of a goal--

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Conquering.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.671 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: --and likes to
have difficult obstacles

00:20:09.671 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:90%
to overcome.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:90%
The hero's journey.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.145 align:middle line:84%
You break through the
obstacles to get to the goal.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:13.719 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So that's what the
masculine does with everything.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So for thousands of
years, man or woman,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:84%
if you were interested
in awakening,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
what was mostly available to
you was a hierarchical context--

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
very often with a teacher who
was reported to be enlightened,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
which is a concept
we could question.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you would join
an organization,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.612 align:middle line:84%
follow very often a
holy book of dogma.

00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:40.945 align:middle line:90%
And this was what was available.

00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, either you really
were just like a free agent

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
who winged it on their own-- but
that was a very difficult thing

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.617 align:middle line:84%
to do-- or if you
wanted help, this

00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:90%
was the help that was available.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Very, very patriarchal,
structured help.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, even 30, 40 years ago,
this remained unquestioned.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to when you and
I were discovering this stuff,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:90%
that was the way it was.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
People went to Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi with TM or to Rajneesh

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.574 align:middle line:90%
or-- he's now Osho.

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
That was what was available.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
You went to a male teacher
with an organization

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and you would fit in
with what was going on.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
My teacher, Poonja Ji,
did not operate that way.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%
He was more of a coach.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have an organization.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a teaching.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And as quickly as possible,
he entered into a friendship

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.627 align:middle line:84%
with people that was
non-hierarchical.

00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
what I grew up on.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:90%
That was what worked for me.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But once I got back
to America again,

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
initially he asked me to teach.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, OK, now
you know the secret.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Go and share the secret
with your friends.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happened.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly the
same thing occurred.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But now it was
ridiculous because I'd

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
been 20 years on
the receiving end

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of this hierarchical
relationship,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
now I found myself on
the other side of it,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that I was sitting
in a chair and people

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
would sit there
and like, namaste.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he looked at me.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And I realized it's all made up.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it is projection.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What we're looking
for, yes, essentially.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The whole
theater, you see,

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.723 align:middle line:84%
the whole theater of a
teacher and students.

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous amount
of projection happens.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So after a few years-- three,
four years of doing this-- I

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.086 align:middle line:84%
went back to see him
again-- my teacher.

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I don't
want to do this anymore.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
a teacher because it

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
feels to me a very artificial
kind of theater is created.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
This hierarchy is not true.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
To say somebody's enlightened
and somebody's un-enlightened,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:90%
it's just not true.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.887 align:middle line:84%
If we were talking about
looking at the sky,

00:22:55.887 --> 00:22:57.345 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't then
make a demarcation

00:22:57.345 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this
is a sky see-er,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
this is a non sky see-er.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.937 align:middle line:90%
It's just the sky.

00:23:02.937 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.186 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So seeing
the truth of things,

00:23:05.186 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make you a
different kind of human being,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's
available to everybody.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him, I just wasn't
comfortable with the theater

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.884 align:middle line:84%
that was easily
created around it.

00:23:16.884 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
His response to me
was very interesting.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, do whatever you want.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.077 align:middle line:84%
Except, of course, he said,
(GRUFFLY) do whatever you want.

00:23:25.077 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
(NORMAL VOICE) But
you have a destiny,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and the destiny
eventually will win.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.246 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I didn't know
what he meant by that.

00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:90%
But I said, OK.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.012 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was very
good advice, though.

00:23:36.012 --> 00:23:37.845 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, I had
no idea what he meant.

00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So I went
back to America,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and now I had nothing
to do because I

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:90%
had resigned as being a teacher.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I used to teach in
a massage school called

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
"Alive and Well" in
San Anselmo, California

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.537 align:middle line:84%
where I had previously
taught hypnotherapy.

00:23:55.537 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, would you like
to have your job back because we

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%
need a hypnotherapy teacher.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.606 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm not going
to teach hypnotherapy anymore,

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I could
train people to do

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.737 align:middle line:84%
what I've been
doing as a teacher.

00:24:05.737 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I could train them how to
do this with each other.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
They said, great,
let's try that out.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first awakening
coaching training in 1995.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 20 years now.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is-- so
you're living your destiny.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:90%
You're living out your destiny.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But I didn't know
what it was then, you see?

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
example though.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Didn't
know what it was.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In Arjuna's
eighth book--

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Let me
say one more thing.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Because here's
the interesting thing.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.735 align:middle line:84%
I had been with Poonja Ji, I
had been with many teachers,

00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and I had seen this very
powerful transmission that

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
could happen where people
would experience awakening.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I had this
class of 30 people

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and I started training them
to do this with each other,

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
here was the amazing thing--
the awakening was just as deep,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
just as profound when
it was peer based,

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.374 align:middle line:84%
and the results were
more stable because it

00:24:52.374 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:90%
didn't have this projection.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.775 align:middle line:84%
The results were
actually more stable.

00:24:55.775 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I ask you
about that transmission

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Did you physically see a
transmission coming through

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or did you see the manifestation
of it with the people?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.401 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: No.

00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking simply about what
happens when two people get

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
together and somebody,
who we're calling

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
the teacher or the facilitator,
guides somebody into awakening,

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.796 align:middle line:84%
you could call that a
kind of transmission.

00:25:17.796 --> 00:25:19.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that
word is used and thrown

00:25:19.545 --> 00:25:21.755 align:middle line:90%
around a lot here in the US.

00:25:21.755 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: About deeksha
and the transmission

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
from the oneness
and so forth and I

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:90%
don't know a lot about it.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But could you tell me a
little bit about that?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.253 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Don't know about that.

00:25:32.253 --> 00:25:34.897 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But do you know that
transmission you're just

00:25:34.897 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
talking about as the experience.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:37.839 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for clearing that up.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
a look at Arjuna

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about his latest book
called, "Better Than Sex."

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Hi, this
is Arjuna Ardagh.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm extremely delighted to
tell you about my latest book.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
As you might know, I've
written eight books in my life.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And, honestly, most
of them, I write

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.369 align:middle line:84%
them and I say
what I have to say

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
and I never look at them again.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I do, they don't
really engage me very much.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just finished a book now
which is the first time ever

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
in my life that
I've written a book

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's my favorite reading.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting on
a train in Austria

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.445 align:middle line:84%
reading this book on my
iPad and laughing out loud.

00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said, ah, you
look like you're enjoying that

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:90%
What are you reading?

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's called,
"Better Than Sex."

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:90%
They said, who wrote it?

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, I did.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is my new book.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
"Better Than Sex."

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You can get it on
Kindle and iBooks

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can get it on
Amazon as a physical book.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I love this book.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It's everything I've ever
wanted to say in 200 pages.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:90%
A little bit more.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The book is really a
beginner's introduction

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to the work we do called
awakening coaching.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you the
story of everything

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:84%
we have to say through
the analogy of a party.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:90%
So you're invited to a party.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I invite you into the book.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.609 align:middle line:84%
Quickly we establish
it's a potluck party.

00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So we find out what
you had to bring,

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
which is your longing,
your intention,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:90%
your passion in life.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I introduce you to
a lot of different people.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are coaches.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are people who
have benefited from coaching--

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
to find out really
exactly what is possible

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:84%
when we take the longing
for awakening out

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of the context of
hierarchical spirituality

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
with a guru or an avatar
or a saint or something,

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
into the context of peer
support, which is really

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.316 align:middle line:90%
what coaching is all about.

00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the book we
talk about what

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is awakening, what is
coaching, and why is there

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
this revolution in coaching,
which, in my opinion,

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
is really an important symptom
of the evolution of humanity

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we bring
awakening and coaching

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We go through the seven-- the
seven-- innate brilliances

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:84%
which makes someone an
incredibly great awakening

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
coach.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
These are qualities that can
be learned and duplicated.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not something
you have to be born with.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
We talk about what's
it like to be coached.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
What kind of issues does this
kind of coaching address?

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
What do you need
to become a coach?

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And I also do my best to
answer all of the questions

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that people ask me repeatedly
in evening presentations

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:90%
and workshops and conferences.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope you're going
to love this book.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I would like to say it's funny
as well as being explanatory.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to
really offer you

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a present--
two presents.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
First of all, when
you get this book,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
it automatically
gives you access

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to a members website,
which has video,

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.766 align:middle line:84%
audio, additional readings,
which really fleshes it out.

00:28:55.766 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So everything we talk
about in the book

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:90%
you can watch on video.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You can watch demonstrations
of awakening on video.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you
pay for the book,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
if you buy it as an
e-book it's $9.99.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If you buy it on Amazon as
a physical book, it's $15.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you pay,
keep your receipt,

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
we give you a complete
credit for whatever

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
you paid for whatever you
want to do with us next,

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's being
coached, becoming a coach,

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:90%
taking an online course.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, if you take
any next step, the book is free.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.171 align:middle line:84%
I hope you will really
jump in and buy this book.

00:29:29.171 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to because
I love it so much,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you'll
enjoy reading it

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
as much as I enjoy reading
it on my Vienna train rides.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.330 align:middle line:90%
See you soon.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.689 align:middle line:90%
This is Arjuna Ardagh.

00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in the book you talk
about the style of coaching--

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the awakening coaching--
being very different

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:90%
for men and women.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Mm-hm.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, the
aspects of coaching

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:90%
are different for men and women.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
When we have a
moment of awakening,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
which is also always
somehow a moment--

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
can have several.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Oh, yeah.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You can have now
and now and now.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.046 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So whenever there's
a moment of awakening,

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:84%
what is recognized is
infinite, is formless.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.835 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of everything,
but it has no substance.

00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So that, of course, is
neither male nor female,

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
masculine or feminine;
it's just emptiness.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as that begins to
be expressed through a body,

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
expressed through

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:84%
the particular
attributes of our body.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So an (INDIAN ACCENT)
Indian awakening

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.744 align:middle line:84%
will be (TEXAN ACCENT) damn
different than Texan awakening

00:30:41.744 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and (FRENCH ACCENT)
very different

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
indeed from French awakening.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
(NORMAL VOICE) So, of
course, every human being

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.425 align:middle line:84%
is going to express
their original nature

00:30:50.425 --> 00:30:52.383 align:middle line:84%
in the same way; it's
the same original nature.

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Through their filters.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, not just
through conditioning.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the same original
nature, but there's

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
like you could say there's a
unique flavor to each human

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.730 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.537 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you saw that when
your daughter was little.

00:31:04.537 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.703 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And she
was at kindergarten.

00:31:06.703 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, kindergarten-age
children are not very

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.265 align:middle line:84%
conditioned yet, but they
have a unique flavor,

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
a unique natural character
they bring into the world.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, so we understand
that, that your original nature

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to express differently
through different physical

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, the most fundamental
difference between people,

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you notice about
anybody before anything else,

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
is their gender.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.139 align:middle line:84%
If I was to say to
you, oh, Lisa have you

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:84%
changed your hair
color a little bit?

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.106 align:middle line:90%
That would be understandable.

00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If I said, well, I
thought I remembered

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:90%
you being a bit taller.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
That be understandable.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.252 align:middle line:84%
If I said, oh, Lisa, I thought
I remembered you had glasses.

00:31:45.252 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:90%
That would be understandable.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.756 align:middle line:84%
If I said, oh, Lisa,
nice to see you.

00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:48.906 align:middle line:90%
Funny, I thought you were a man.

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:50.510 align:middle line:84%
That would be
completely weird, right?

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.876 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever mistakes
somebody's gender.

00:31:52.876 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is true.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Other things
you can get mixed up.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
You could say to me, I didn't
remember you had a beard.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I would get that.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you said,
Arjuna, I thought

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.726 align:middle line:84%
you were a woman,
that would-- I would--

00:32:00.726 --> 00:32:02.393 align:middle line:84%
So gender is the most
fundamental thing.

00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:04.642 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't know, you
could be pretty transgender.

00:32:04.642 --> 00:32:05.612 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty neutral.

00:32:05.612 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Let's not go there.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.319 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're gender neutral.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So gender is the
most fundamental distinction

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:90%
we make.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Yet, despite the fact that
that's the most fundamental

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:84%
distinction, we have actually
made very little distinction

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:84%
historically between
what works for men

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and what works for women
in terms of embodiment.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about
the tools that give you

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.749 align:middle line:84%
the taste of awakening,
that's pretty much the same.

00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking
about the tools that

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
allow you to embody awakening,
that's very, very different

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
because embodiment
involves the balance

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of the body and the
hormones that run

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in a male and female body
are completely different.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't think that
that causes separateness?

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, it's-- that
separateness has a beauty

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, attraction and
sexuality and falling in love

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and all sort of things are a
function of that separateness.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not all
separateness is bad.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great answer.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: There's
good separateness.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually a
little bit of the point.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:16.950 align:middle line:84%
That if we practice-- if we
use practices that are just

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
sort of calming, neutralizing
practices like, you know,

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:90%
namaste, we are one.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's great
for staying really calm,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.424 align:middle line:84%
but there's actually by
now a considerable body

00:33:31.424 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
of scientific evidence
that demonstrates

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.256 align:middle line:84%
that if you do this too
much, your genitals actually

00:33:35.256 --> 00:33:37.648 align:middle line:90%
wither and drop off.

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is not.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah,
Scientific American.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is?

00:33:42.748 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:90%
There is not!

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.927 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Anyway, the thing is--
the thing is-- as you can see,

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to get
too serious about this.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the point is, you
see, that if you actually

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
want to live a passionate
life, which is not just

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.139 align:middle line:84%
about sex and intimacy, but
it's about giving your gift

00:33:59.139 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.417 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be alive and
really live fully and not

00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:84%
just live in this kind of
trance of we're all one.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to really
participate in the world

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.359 align:middle line:84%
and raise your children
beautifully and create

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
an incredible relationship
and do a great TV show and all

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, if you
want to do all that,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:84%
then we don't just need
practices that dull you out

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and make you really sort of--

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You want practices that allow
you to live your passion.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:84%
Those practices are
different for men and women

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:29.085 align:middle line:84%
because the way that we live
our energy is different.

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Men, or masculine
energy, anyway,

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
tends to be more focused,
more goal oriented, more

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to do with breaking through
barriers and going for a goal.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
This is because of
testosterone, you see.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.739 align:middle line:84%
Women, on the other hand,
when they-- so, for a man--

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:84%
now, this is
controversial stuff.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I find myself
that way a lot.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.401 align:middle line:84%
I'm goal oriented,
and I'm task oriented.

00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: We all
have both energies.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
But it is useful to understand
that there are these two

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these-- talking about
yin and yang, shiva and shakti,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine,
I mean, it's very,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:90%
very commonly understood.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It exists.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So here's the thing--
we all have both.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.909 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I have feminine
energy and masculine.

00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You have masculine energy
as well as feminine, right?

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's really great
to be able to understand

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that there are these energies
and certain practices will

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
increase one and
certain practices

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.199 align:middle line:90%
will increase another.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You got it.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.791 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And all
that's important is

00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:23.934 align:middle line:84%
that you have the freedom
to express yourself

00:35:23.934 --> 00:35:24.725 align:middle line:90%
without limitation.

00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me give you, if I may,
the most obvious example where

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:90%
this is useful.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I've met women who
followed very masculine paths.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.967 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of my books came
out about 10 years ago,

00:35:39.967 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:84%
it was called, "The
Translucent Revolution."

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In that book there's a
story of Sherry Anderson,

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:84%
who was a Zen monk--
a Zen abbot actually--

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:90%
in Nova Scotia in Canada.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It was freezing cold.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
She had actually a
Vietnamese Zen master.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Not quite sure how that
works with Vietnam and Japan.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it was a
Vietnamese master.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And she was getting up at 4:00
AM to do Zazen meditation.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:90%
She was totally depressed.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:90%
She had a shaved head.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.300 align:middle line:84%
She felt like-- she
just felt lifeless.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.605 align:middle line:84%
And so she contacted
her teacher and said,

00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:19.069 align:middle line:90%
this is not working for me.

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I feel totally depressed.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, get up
one hour earlier.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:84%
She was following Zazen, happens
to be a hyper masculine path.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly good;
it's just very masculine.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So finally she got so
fed up, she gave up

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
her monk hood, abandoned her
robes, and she moved to Sedona,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Arizona, which happens to
be quite a feminine place,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:84%
grew her hair again
and started to dance.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:90%
She decided to do Sufi dancing.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:84%
She says within six
months she could

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.437 align:middle line:84%
feel god flowing through
every cell of her body.

00:36:51.437 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then she went on
to write a book called,

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:90%
"The Feminine Face of God."

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.063 align:middle line:84%
And she developed a
whole thing around

00:36:56.063 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:90%
feminine spiritual practice.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's a really
poignant example of somebody

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
who was simply practicing an
inappropriate thing for her.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:84%
That practice of Zazen would
be great for somebody else.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It'd be great for me.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I've got a very
masculine energy.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But for somebody with
a very feminine heart,

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
it was crippling her.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've seen-- in the course
of the time I've been teaching

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
this, I've seen so many women
who, in their innocence,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.860 align:middle line:84%
were really longing to know the
divine, to know that deep love,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but they were following a hyper
masculine approach, you see.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's all good,
and sometimes it

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:84%
could be good for a woman to
use hyper masculine techniques

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:84%
or masculine techniques, and
it's good for a man to dance.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.862 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to understand there

00:37:38.862 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:84%
are these different practices,
they have different effects,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and to use the right
practice at the right time

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:90%
for the right person.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very well said.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've seen many
women in Hollywood

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:84%
where there is a lot of
pre-defined positions

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that had to do
with the male race.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And women that then get into
these executive positions

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.850 align:middle line:84%
become very hard
and masculine when

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
they are in those
positions to compete.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them
literally get sick

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because they lose so
much of their femininity

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.749 align:middle line:90%
and their female hormones.

00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well,
here's the good news.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not by any means suggesting
that women should not

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.549 align:middle line:84%
be in positions of
responsibility or power.

00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me neither.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I'm not
saying that at all.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.272 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
different way of doing it.

00:38:22.272 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: It's not even that.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.355 align:middle line:90%
Here's the good news.

00:38:24.355 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
You only need a tiny bit
of conscious practice

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.491 align:middle line:84%
to balance hours of
other activities.

00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good news.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:32.864 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:38:32.864 --> 00:38:35.755 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way that I
work with women clients who

00:38:35.755 --> 00:38:37.290 align:middle line:90%
come to me for coaching.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.162 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
a woman who was--

00:38:39.162 --> 00:38:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't say which city
because it would be, you know,

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
but she was in a
big city in the US.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.700 align:middle line:84%
She was the coordinator
of all the judges.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So there were all
the judges, all men,

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and she was the one
who had to keep them

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:90%
all in tune with each other.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, she tried to do that by
exuding very masculine energy.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, faced with
all these men being judges,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:84%
she never could do
the masculine thing

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:90%
quite as well as they did.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her,
look, all you need

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.160 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of
feminine practice

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.570 align:middle line:90%
to balance out all the day.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've done this
with executives,

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:84%
with police, with
all kinds of things.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:84%
All you need--
this is a takeaway

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.631 align:middle line:90%
from this conversation.

00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
This is all that a
woman needs to do

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.590 align:middle line:90%
who's in an executive position.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.450 align:middle line:84%
When she comes home
in the evening,

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
takes everything
off-- the jewelry,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
everything-- has a shower
to wash it all away.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, funnily enough,
after the shower--

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it may be overdoing it a bit
with the water-- you-- then you

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
have a bath, all righ,
with oils and everything.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.252 align:middle line:84%
Soak in a bath, right,
with maybe some candles.

00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Come out of the bath,
put nice-- and then

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you massage nice
creams into the body.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%
This is all bringing up
oxytocin in the body.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Put on completely
different clothing,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.290 align:middle line:90%
like flowing silk clothing.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Light candles, some nice music,
Sarah McLaughlin or something.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:84%
An hour of that will completely
neutralize an entire day

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:84%
of working in the most
masculine environment.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then how do you
get back into the masculine?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: You don't have
to worry about that.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:90%
That definitely happens.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But the same
thing for a man, you see.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:84%
You might have a
man who has been

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.640 align:middle line:84%
in a very kind of
chaotic environment

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
where there's a lot of
things flying at him.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Like for me for many years
I was raising my kids alone

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:90%
between marriages.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I had a period where
I was a single dad,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I was doing
the shopping, the cleaning,

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.536 align:middle line:90%
and cooking.

00:40:32.536 --> 00:40:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.017 align:middle line:84%
And men, generally
speaking-- this

00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
ought to do with gender
difference-- because

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of hormones, men are
not nearly as good

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:90%
at multitasking as women are.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So men get much
more-- so for a man,

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:84%
you only need to sit or
do chikun or something

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.471 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes of centering
and it brings you back.

00:40:52.471 --> 00:40:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to do it all day.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the point about practice.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.269 align:middle line:84%
You practice meditation
or dance or yoga,

00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:00.810 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
do it all the time.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.976 align:middle line:84%
A little bit is enough to
bring you back to balance.

00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can recenter.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, regardless of gender,
everyone has a deep longing.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And this next clip here is
about discovering your deepest

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:90%
longing.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: What is
your deepest longing?

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I've asked that question or
facilitated that question being

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
asked in groups with
thousands and thousands

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of people.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to
a few observations

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that I want to share with
you about that question.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:40.070 align:middle line:84%
The first observation is
it's not just the question

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:84%
but the space from which
the question is asked

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:90%
makes all the difference.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do a really
quick demonstration of this

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:90%
with Vicki.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I just volunteered Vicki.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So here's one way
to ask the question.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Something like this.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Vicki, you're from?

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ventura.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Ventura.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Very nice.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Ventura.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.204 align:middle line:84%
There's some cool people
living in Ventura.

00:42:03.204 --> 00:42:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me Vicki,
I'm curious to know.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.078 align:middle line:90%
What is your deepest longing?

00:42:06.078 --> 00:42:08.017 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.017 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: You want the answer?

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:09.974 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your deepest
longing, Vicki.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Grace and ease.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Grace and ease.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Isn't there a TV show
called grace and ease.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.950 align:middle line:84%
No, maybe that's
"Will and Grace."

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Great answer, Vicki.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.718 align:middle line:84%
Give a round of applause to
Vicki for grace and ease.

00:42:24.718 --> 00:42:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, wait, wait, wait, tell me
your deepest longing, Vicki.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Are
we starting again?

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.334 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me your deepest
longing, would you?

00:42:34.334 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Grace and ease.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Grace and ease.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.871 align:middle line:84%
Let me just see if
there's an app for that.

00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's see, Grace-- OK.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way to
ask the question, right,

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.320 align:middle line:84%
which obviously I exaggerated
it for dramatic purposes.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But to ask it in a
kind of high energy

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:90%
but slightly distracted state.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Now let me ask you again.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.402 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Vicki, what's
your deepest longing?

00:42:58.402 --> 00:43:04.865 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.865 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The same.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Grace and ease.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Mm-hm.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And what's even deeper?

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.834 align:middle line:90%
What's your deepest longing?

00:43:13.834 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um, peace.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Peace.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So quick contrast.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The answers you're going
to get to that question

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
vary tremendously on
the degree of presence

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.460 align:middle line:90%
which we bring as a coach.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.560 align:middle line:84%
We could obviously elaborate
a lot more on that,

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
but I've got 15 minutes
and the clock's whirring,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:84%
so let me tell you the
second observation.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:84%
When we work with this question,
asking people to go deeper,

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that
longing works in layers.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And very often the
first answer people

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:84%
give you may not actually
be their deepest answer.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.245 align:middle line:90%
Not that it's the wrong answer.

00:43:58.245 --> 00:44:00.816 align:middle line:84%
It might be-- in fact, it might
even be the correct answer,

00:44:00.816 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's more like the
words and the feeling of it.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the
difference with that?

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Somebody could
say-- you could ask,

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:90%
what's your deepest longing?

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Oneness with all things.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's somehow you can
feel that they're just

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:84%
quoting Eckhart Tolle
rather than really

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.800 align:middle line:90%
feeling the longing itself.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Longing goes in layers.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed is if
you can help someone as a coach

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to shift from one layer
of longing to another,

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the deeper layer will actually
nourish the initial layer.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.219 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:37.260 align:middle line:84%
We might start with, what's
your deepest longing?

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.300 align:middle line:84%
To have a $2 million a
year income, a great house,

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and a Ferrari.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:46.390 align:middle line:90%
What's your deepest longing?

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:90%
To make a difference.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:90%
To serve people.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:90%
To contribute.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, you probably
know-- I'm sure you

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.270 align:middle line:84%
know as coaches, if
you can serve someone

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:84%
to make a contribution,
it's probably

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.850 align:middle line:84%
going to give them a
comfortable lifestyle.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Going after the lifestyle
is not necessarily

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
going to give them
a sense of service.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You see the point?

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I love
how you bring what

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:84%
you talk about into
practical terms

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately you're
residing in the US now

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and you are-- part
of your destiny

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is to bring these teachings
from your vast experiences

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.380 align:middle line:90%
to a practical level.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And even though the Gaiam
audience is international,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
it appeals to every
single person.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Now you recently did
a talk at Google.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And why did they
bring you in there--

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.235 align:middle line:84%
I was just curious-- to a group
of software engineers, yes?

00:45:36.235 --> 00:45:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, Google is a great
company like that.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Google is, I think,
the pioneer, globally,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:84%
at really making an attempt
to fundamentally transform

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.840 align:middle line:90%
corporate culture.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:46:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it's-- By now it's a
warn out idiom that people say

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:90%
thank God it's Friday.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: It's kind of
commonly understood maxim

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
like going to work.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's completely illogical.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, since you spend
most of your time there,

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:15.200 align:middle line:84%
it would really make
sense that we look forward

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:90%
to going to work.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Because I do.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever leave work
because I enjoy it so much.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So Google is really
pioneering what's

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:30.800 align:middle line:84%
it going to take to create
a corporate culture that

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:84%
gets the job done
but that actually

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.220 align:middle line:84%
gets people inspired
and passionate.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.669 align:middle line:84%
And it's a work in
progress, of course.

00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's great.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So they've
installed meditation rooms.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They've got a slide instead of
stairs in one of the buildings.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.840 align:middle line:84%
They've done everything they
can to make it more fun.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But, of course,
what's really required

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is not just external
change but to really help

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.880 align:middle line:84%
people to shift
their consciousness.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.659 align:middle line:84%
So they invite all
sorts of experts

00:46:56.659 --> 00:46:57.950 align:middle line:90%
in who have something to offer.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They have a program
called Google Pause.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:90%
So I was speaking in that vein.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very
grateful for the reception.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.504 align:middle line:84%
People were very,
very open there.

00:47:08.504 --> 00:47:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you were
talking about inspiring

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.546 align:middle line:90%
your creative genius, yeah?

00:47:11.546 --> 00:47:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.115 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the thing,
you see, that awakening--

00:47:15.115 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
awakening, it has really

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:84%
being fostered in
oriental cultures, which

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.580 align:middle line:84%
tend to be more
inward and reclusive.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's hot there-- India,
especially the south of India,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:90%
it's very hot.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Too hot to do very much.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.862 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:32.862 --> 00:47:33.362 align:middle line:90%
Very still.

00:47:33.362 --> 00:47:35.695 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: You have to spend
a lot of time keeping still.

00:47:35.695 --> 00:47:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But we don't live
in such a hot place,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.810 align:middle line:90%
so we're not quite so reclusive.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And for you and me
and everybody we know,

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.640 align:middle line:84%
our lives are about
creating stuff.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have children
and we have a house,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.830 align:middle line:84%
make the house beautiful,
and then you do what you can

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:84%
for the environment
and for transforming

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.580 align:middle line:90%
the economy and politics.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Your life is about contribution.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So when-- I think
probably it would

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
be true for most of the
people listening to this,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.490 align:middle line:84%
just getting into a kind of
empty state and staying there,

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't really
feel like a good use

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.920 align:middle line:90%
of a life for most people.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.890 align:middle line:84%
We want to actually
manifest that.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So the good news
is that when you

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
tune into this infinite
consciousness, in one sense

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:90%
it's empty.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:23.470 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of
color and shape and movement

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.088 align:middle line:90%
and sound, it is empty.

00:48:25.088 --> 00:48:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But in another way, it is
full of pure potentiality.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.600 align:middle line:90%
It is the source of all love.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Where does love come from?

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:40.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we sit and
meet-- when friends sit and meet

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and we look into each other's
eyes, we go, ah, yeah.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.036 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
feeling come from?

00:48:45.036 --> 00:48:46.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not biological.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in the
cells that can do that.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:84%
It's something-- it's that
infinite consciousness.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It is love itself,
but it is also

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:90%
the source of every new idea.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Where do ideas come from?

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.106 align:middle line:84%
You can regurgitate
things you've heard.

00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:05.980 align:middle line:84%
If you go to school and
you learn this thing,

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.990 align:middle line:90%
you can repeat it for the exam.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.812 align:middle line:90%
That's coming from conditioning.

00:49:09.812 --> 00:49:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you read
something in a book

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and reorganize it
and then come forth

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.760 align:middle line:84%
with an original, new
idea, that does not

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.140 align:middle line:84%
come from conditioning,
that comes from--

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inspiration.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: That comes from--
yeah, like the-- the dark hole,

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.209 align:middle line:84%
you could say the black hole out
of which everything manifests.

00:49:27.209 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen this new movie
about the life of Stephen

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.541 align:middle line:84%
Hawking where he's-- it's
a very beautiful movie.

00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:34.384 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Theory of Everything."

00:49:34.384 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wonderful.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.383 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And he's talking
in that movie about how

00:49:37.383 --> 00:49:39.179 align:middle line:84%
black holes are
incredibly compressed,

00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:41.845 align:middle line:84%
but they actually are the source
out of which everything arises,

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:46.890 align:middle line:84%
you see, so that infinite space
which is formless, timeless,

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:51.220 align:middle line:84%
which has no content, it's
out of that unmanifest source

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:90%
that everything arises.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.850 align:middle line:90%
So we were talking earlier.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:50:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Every example of true
genius-- true genius

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.400 align:middle line:84%
is not the capacity to
regurgitate what you've heard;

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:84%
true genius is the capacity
to be a vehicle for something

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to pass through you-- not
from you-- from a source that

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.600 align:middle line:90%
is unknown.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's well known
that Albert Einstein,

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:84%
he came up with a theory of
relativity in the bathtub.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't sitting, trying.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.880 align:middle line:90%
He was spacious.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Good friend of
ours, Jack Canfield

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.630 align:middle line:84%
who has sold more
books in his field

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.884 align:middle line:84%
than in history, where did
he come up with the title

00:50:28.884 --> 00:50:30.050 align:middle line:90%
"Chicken Soup for the Soul?"

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:90%
He was meditating.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:90%
He was spacious.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And he saw this hand, "Chicken
Soup," and he had a thought,

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to call
my book "Chicken Soup."

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.881 align:middle line:84%
And the hand went
on, "for the Soul."

00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:90%
He went, oh.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It came to him.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs, we were talking
about Steve Jobs earlier, well,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:84%
most people know now Steve Jobs,
he started out experimenting

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.206 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of consciousness
changing methodologies.

00:50:50.206 --> 00:50:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And that opened his space
enough to bring forth

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:84%
a whole revolution in the way
that we think about computers.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So every genius, everyone
who brings something

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.330 align:middle line:84%
fresh that's never
been there before,

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:84%
they have access
to the infinite.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
awakening-- it's

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:84%
not just about escaping
the world at all--

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.310 align:middle line:84%
it's about being connected to
the source in which brilliance

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:90%
arises.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
Arjuna's talk at Google.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.757 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:51:19.757 --> 00:51:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And that's really
been the question that

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
has governed my
entire adult life.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.770 align:middle line:84%
From being a student at
Cambridge University,

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that was really what fascinated
me more than anything else.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.165 align:middle line:84%
What is it that allows
us-- Well, first

00:51:36.165 --> 00:51:37.540 align:middle line:84%
of all, what is
it that allows us

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:84%
to live incredibly
fulfilled lives?

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:43.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the key that allows
some people under almost

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.880 align:middle line:84%
any circumstance to be
living a life of no regret?

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.060 align:middle line:84%
To be living a life where
you are impassioned,

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
where you're on fire, where
you feel grateful easily.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that allows many
other people to be suffering,

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.570 align:middle line:84%
not always for physical reasons,
but especially in our culture

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.870 align:middle line:84%
people suffer more for
psychological reasons,

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.480 align:middle line:84%
for attitudinal
reasons more than

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.630 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have enough food

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:13.420 align:middle line:90%
or water or physical things.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Initially in this
investigation, I

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.780 align:middle line:84%
thought that
ultimate fulfillment

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:23.960 align:middle line:84%
was to do with spirituality
because a lot of the most

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled people in our
culture have been mystics,

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:84%
have been people who have
created spiritual traditions

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.370 align:middle line:90%
or religions.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But actually, when
we investigate it

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in an objective way,
it's not always true.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You can make your life
about spirituality,

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you can make your
life about meditation;

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:47.090 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily in a
reliable way to fulfillment.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So what else could it be?

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then I considered
maybe it's love.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's having
perfect relationships,

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:84%
having the right spouse
and the right 2.35 children

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and the right suburb
of the right city.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the
key to fulfillment.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't have so long to go
into all the possibilities--

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
possible answers--

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but what seems to hit
the nail every time

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is to drop into the
frequency of genius.

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:84%
When we fall into-- as
Rachel was speaking,

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.930 align:middle line:84%
when we fall into a
flow where you know

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you're doing the
right thing, you

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:27.090 align:middle line:84%
know you're creating
the right thing,

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.660 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're
contributing exactly what you

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.300 align:middle line:84%
were born to contribute,
to contribute to all of us

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.290 align:middle line:84%
moving forwards,
that, I would say,

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.800 align:middle line:84%
whenever someone falls
into that frequency,

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a reliable key to
a life of no regret--

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:45.412 align:middle line:84%
to a life of
complete fulfillment.

00:53:45.412 --> 00:53:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The question
that's arising

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:49.100 align:middle line:84%
from me is we talked at
the beginning of the show

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.170 align:middle line:84%
about the ego, and the
ego being a behavior.

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a tangible,
physical thing.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference between
the ego and love that is also

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:07.120 align:middle line:90%
non-tangible, it is a behavior.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.444 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:54:08.444 --> 00:54:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So the difference has to do
with the source of the energy.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to say
now is incredibly black

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:90%
and white and oversimplistic.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But one dimension of you
and me and everybody we know

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:84%
is conditioning,
which is the way

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:90%
that a computer is programmed.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.794 align:middle line:84%
If you program a computer in
a certain way, it stores code.

00:54:44.794 --> 00:54:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
click this button,

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.050 align:middle line:84%
you can be absolutely sure
what the result will be.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.070 align:middle line:84%
If you click the button that
says Print, lo and behold,

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.472 align:middle line:90%
the printer starts printing.

00:54:53.472 --> 00:54:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not that
sometimes you hit Print

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and the shower comes on.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you hit Print
and the sprinkler system

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:00.390 align:middle line:90%
goes on in the garden.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.119 align:middle line:84%
You hit Print, every single
time you get the same result.

00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:90%
That's conditioned.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.610 align:middle line:90%
It's programmed, right.

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of
things about human beings

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.105 align:middle line:84%
that are conditioned,
and there's

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.105 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with that.

00:55:10.105 --> 00:55:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly good.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.040 align:middle line:84%
When I walk over to
the door, I don't

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.052 align:middle line:84%
have to learn again how
to use a door handle.

00:55:16.052 --> 00:55:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's conditioned in me.

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:17.954 align:middle line:90%
I reach out.

00:55:17.954 --> 00:55:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to think.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.084 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with a car.

00:55:20.084 --> 00:55:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
learn how to drive

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.690 align:middle line:90%
the car every time I get in.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I know how to operate the
clutch and all that, right?

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.936 align:middle line:84%
So that's one level of you
and me and everybody we know

00:55:28.936 --> 00:55:29.520 align:middle line:90%
is condition.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.614 align:middle line:90%
In that way we're robotic.

00:55:30.614 --> 00:55:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We're actually--
we're pretty much

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.880 align:middle line:90%
like conditioned computers.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is another dimension
to you and me and everybody

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.990 align:middle line:84%
we know which you
don't have to go

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.310 align:middle line:84%
through a long journey
of completely getting

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.400 align:middle line:84%
rid of the first one to
get to the second one.

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It's there all the time,
which is spontaneous.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.584 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to find the words.

00:55:53.584 --> 00:55:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's good that it's
hard to find the right words

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:58.880 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about a realm that is not

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.912 align:middle line:84%
within the realm-- it's
not within the prison

00:56:01.912 --> 00:56:02.970 align:middle line:90%
of conditioned language.

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.060 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But-- so let's call it like
this, like an eruption,

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:09.020 align:middle line:90%
like a spurting out of nothing.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like quantum physics,
you see, there's nothing.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And out of absolutely
nothing arises something.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a wave and then the
wave just becomes a particle

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.400 align:middle line:84%
through observation that
was not there before.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you-- you've
got a beautiful husband

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:26.986 align:middle line:90%
and a beautiful daughter.

00:56:26.986 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:84%
When you're together
with your family--

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen you with your
family-- you look at them

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.651 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm sure
you've seen this.

00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And you might just
suddenly say something.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.970 align:middle line:84%
You might look at your
daughter and look at her

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and then she'll speak
something, and you

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.196 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
she's going to say

00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's completely spontaneous.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
mostly what humor is.

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, when we
enjoy humor together,

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:49.754 align:middle line:84%
it's usually we laugh when
somebody says something

00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that was completely
unpredictable.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You could never have guessed
what they were going to say.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's like a
rehearsed joke or something.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But if we're just-- sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt you.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we're just
fooling around together,

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.832 align:middle line:84%
that's why we laugh, because
somebody says something

00:57:01.832 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:90%
you could not have predicted.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.834 align:middle line:84%
So all the time these two
dimensions are going on.

00:57:06.834 --> 00:57:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually there's
three dimensions.

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.990 align:middle line:84%
There's also the physical body
that has its own conditioning.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But that's more
biological conditioning,

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.540 align:middle line:90%
that's not social conditioning.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.561 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
body that wants

00:57:17.561 --> 00:57:19.394 align:middle line:84%
to pee when it wants
to pee and wants to eat

00:57:19.394 --> 00:57:20.852 align:middle line:84%
and wants to sleep,
and then you've

00:57:20.852 --> 00:57:23.280 align:middle line:84%
got this conditioned
thoughts, and then

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.240 align:middle line:84%
deeper than that there is the
eruption of pure spontaneity.

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And all three co-exist, you see.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so it could erupt
as ego, it could erupt as love?

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: No, no, no.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.267 align:middle line:84%
What you're calling ego
is a way of describing

00:57:39.267 --> 00:57:40.350 align:middle line:90%
this conditioned behavior.

00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, got it.

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Which is conditioned
towards being small, being

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:44.910 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels
small and separate,

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.140 align:middle line:84%
so it gets manipulative,
it gets competitive,

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.330 align:middle line:90%
it's willing to tell lies.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:51.310 align:middle line:90%
It does all this stuff.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's understandable because
it has defined itself as me.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It said, I'm a me.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
the idea of me,

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.400 align:middle line:90%
which you also can't find that.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.860 align:middle line:90%
You can't find the ego.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't find the I or the me.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about it.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't actually
directly experience it.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever has.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:12.286 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So this idea
of me as separate,

00:58:12.286 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you think
of yourself as me,

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.120 align:middle line:84%
separate, now everybody
else is a threat.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to cheat a little
bit and lie a little bit,

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:21.130 align:middle line:90%
manipulate a little bit.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
All of that behavior--
it's not wrong--

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.330 align:middle line:84%
it's completely the
inevitable byproduct

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of thinking of yourself
as small and separate.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
behave that way.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But the other dimension of
you, which is always here,

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.230 align:middle line:84%
which is infinite,
which is spacious,

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:38.250 align:middle line:84%
which needs nothing
from everybody,

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.940 align:middle line:84%
which has everything
to give to everybody,

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.000 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't need to
manipulate or lie at all.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- this
is the big catch,

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.770 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to get rid of one
in order to access the other.

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You can accept that
they all coexist.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
relax, actually,

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.780 align:middle line:84%
into recognizing
the spaciousness,

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.020 align:middle line:84%
the more you can be
humorous about little quirks

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioning
and laugh about it.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm nearly 60 and,
you know, I'm British.

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And I do British things.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:10.200 align:middle line:90%
I say things in a British way.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.640 align:middle line:84%
If somebody bangs
into me, I say, sorry.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just British
conditioning, you see?

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can laugh about that.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.410 align:middle line:84%
My kids, you know,
they-- we were in-- we

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:24.640 align:middle line:84%
were together in
TLC this summer.

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And our mutual friend, Chris
Atwood, he asked my son,

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Abby, he said, well, so how
was it being raised by Arjuna?

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.086 align:middle line:90%
I guess they were curious.

00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:34.460 align:middle line:84%
What kind of dad
would Arjuna be?

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.876 align:middle line:84%
How was it being
raised by Arjuna?

00:59:35.876 --> 00:59:38.040 align:middle line:84%
My son looked up for a
minute and he said, well,

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.302 align:middle line:84%
it was basically a series
of awkward moments.

00:59:41.302 --> 00:59:45.329 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great answer.

00:59:45.329 --> 00:59:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So, you see, we
have our personalities,

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:51.610 align:middle line:84%
but the more you can rest in
this undefined spaciousness,

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the more you just laugh
about the idiosyncrasies

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.670 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioning, you
don't have to make it go away.

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It's all just
happily coexisting.

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is why there
is a result of laughter

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.228 align:middle line:84%
from awakening coaching,
which you explain,

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:02.620 align:middle line:90%
which is wonderful.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Totally.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.902 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've so enjoyed--

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Oh, is it finished?

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to keep going.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.046 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Oh, I
want another one.

01:00:11.046 --> 01:00:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We'll have to
do this again sometime.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Totally.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love
your-- I could listen

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.595 align:middle line:84%
to your stories and your
philosophies all day.

01:00:18.595 --> 01:00:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Aw.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.891 align:middle line:90%
I want another ride.

01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.160 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.522 align:middle line:84%
The journeys and your
storytelling is beautiful.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, you know, you're
the best interviewer ever,

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.480 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am emerged here.

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: All right.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.625 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:36.675 align:middle line:84%
