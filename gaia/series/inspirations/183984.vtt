>>LISA GARR: Everything we
do is based on the agreements

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:90%
that we have made.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
If it's agreements
with ourselves

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
or other people
or God or life, we

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:10%
have set it up at some point.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So what if we were to
do this intentionally,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
like Don Miguel Ruiz
suggests in his book

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
"The Four Agreements,"
which, by the way,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
it spent almost a decade on "The
New York Times" bestseller list

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and sold over 7 million copies.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Based on the ancient
Toltec wisdom,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
"The Four Agreements" offers
a powerful code of conduct

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that can rapidly
transform our lives

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to a new experience of
freedom, of true happiness,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:90%
and of ultimately love.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I am so honored to be welcomed
here by Don Miguel Ruiz.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.985 align:middle line:84%

>>DON MIGUEL RUIZ:
Well, it is my pleasure.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It's great to meet you.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
We have spent time together
at some incredible moments

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was once we
were at a conference together,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
exercise where we are all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:90%
giving each other hugs.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And out of all the people
that I was hugging,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I got a hug from you
and I burst into tears

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
because you showed me
what pure love felt like.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I will always remember that.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
You really represent that
heart-opening incredible pure

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So I know that people
will be able to feel that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.595 align:middle line:84%
by listening to our interview
today, so thank you.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well,
you're very welcome.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You experienced
that all day, don't you?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>RUIZ: Well, I am love,
but you are also love.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And everybody is love,
they just don't know.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:90%
But they are.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I say, they
just don't believe it.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
lot of things that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
knock us off that love,
though, Don Miguel.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Sure.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lot of
challenges, a lot

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
of wrongness, a lot of
hurt, which brings me

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.712 align:middle line:90%
to "The Four Agreements."

00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, that's
the reason why

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I create this book, to solve
a problem that we all have,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.325 align:middle line:84%
and that problem is
the domestication.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.605 align:middle line:90%
What is domestication?

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we are
animals, and we're

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
trained to please other people.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
They prepare us to
be part of society.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
This society exists even
long before we was born.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And society is
changing all the time,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
have all these rules, all
the laws, the ways you have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:90%
to behave, all those beliefs.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:90%
There's so many beliefs--

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
political beliefs, real
issues beliefs, sports.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all iterations.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is already ongoing.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:90%
We personally didn't create it.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
We was born here.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And when our brain was
getting more and more mature,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
our parents hook our
attention and they start

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:90%
teaching us what they know.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they know
is the society.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We go to school, and they
teach us also what they know.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They prepare us to be
part of that society,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and we believe everything.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.265 align:middle line:84%
We was domesticated to be
a human being according

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.535 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of what
a human being is.

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We are people-pleasing
machines, aren't we?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
From very early on, we want to
please our parents for love.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Our parents want us to
please them for love.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
We go into society, we're
judged on our grades, what

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
we're asked to perform
at a certain level

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
in order to hit certain
markers in your childhood

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.425 align:middle line:84%
and adolescence and adulthood
and work life and everything.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.315 align:middle line:90%
We are people-pleasing machines.

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Yes, we are
domesticated animals,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and we produce
that domestication.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, we create a whole belief
system, very complicated,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and we adopt all the rules
that exist in society

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and we apply it to ourself.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We have all the beliefs about
whatever religion we follow,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
about all what we
say a little before.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But what about if it's
not true what we believe?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
blows your mind.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it really
changes everything.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Then with these
Four Agreements is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
like a challenge to
everything that we

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
believe because we create all
those agreements to support

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%
everything that we believe--

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
what is good, bad, right,
wrong, should be, shouldn't be.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.295 align:middle line:84%
We like to judge everybody, and
we judge ourself the same way.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We are the worst judge to
ourself than anybody else.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And we judge ourself according
to rules of the domestication

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Society, performance,
all of these things.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So did "The Four
Agreements" come out

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
of your experience in being
raised in the Toltec way?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Did you come about
these four agreements

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
because of what you
were experiencing

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
with domestication?

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: OK, let me tell
you how that happened.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a medical
doctor, a surgeon,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and I practiced dental
surgery with my brother,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
who is an oral surgeon.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I was just a surgeon, but
I practiced a lot with him.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But in certain moment,
I see that the problem

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
is in the mind, not
in the physical body.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Then at that moment,
I really want

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
the mind works.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Then I stop being
a medical doctor.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my mother, who
carried the Toltec knowledge,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.615 align:middle line:90%
and she becomes my mentor.

00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Then I didn't really
leave the medicine behind.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I just changed the direction.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I focus all my intention into
understand the human mind

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
until it was as
clear as water to me.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The I start working
with apprentices

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
for around 10 years, more
and more apprentices.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I create so many
different ways how

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to study them, how to help
them in the integration

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of their life, and the result,
it was "The Four Agreements."

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah It's interesting
you came about it

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
from the opposite way
of looking at the mind

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and looking at surgery
and looking at damage

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and wondering where
did this start.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then when
the mind becomes

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to be like a clear
water, I see also

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the solutions because I
understand the problem was

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:90%
the human domestication.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And we want to be free
of that domestication.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Then four simple agreements
becomes the biggest challenge

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to doubt about
everything that we know.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the beginning, it
was already five agreements,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
but I decide to work only the
four ones because the fifth one

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was too
much for anybody.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, years later, my son Jose
wrote "The Fifth Agreement."

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Then it came out anyway.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about
"The Four Agreements"?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.668 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Sure.

00:08:26.668 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the first
one is to always

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:90%
be impeccable with your word.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Be impeccable
with the word.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need to understand
that we live in a story

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
that we create, and
that story is not real.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:90%
It's virtual.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's woven.

>>RUIZ: Mm-hm.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we see
objects, but it's not true.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
We perceive light.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The light that is coming
from those objects

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
hit the object, going into
our eye and project it.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is easy to prove
because right now if you

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
look around, you'll
see a lot of objects.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you close your

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your perception
of them disappears, yes.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Close your eyes,
everything disappear.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes,
everything appear

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:90%
because it's a projection.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But our mind, we
can say our brain

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
have the property to
make sense of everything,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and the mind is just a
reflection of what we perceive.

>>LISA: True.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But with the brain,
we just don't see the things,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
we judge things.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
We classify it.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
We explain it, and we believe
that what we see is real.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, some of it
is, though, Don Miguel.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Some of the things are real.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, the ones that
is in your mind is not real.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It is just an image.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
An image of a flower, then
that is outside of you.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You touch the
flower, that is real.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But the one that is in your
eyes, that is in your brain

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:90%
is not real.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But you create from that image a
whole story, and in that story,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%
you are the main character.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You create everything,
and you fill it

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
with all the
secondary characters,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
not just persons, but
objects, circumstances.

All the events that are

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%

And everything that happen

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:90%
analyzed by what you believe.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You judge it, you qualify it,
and you store it in that way.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's already distort.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the story
that we're storing.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: It is the story by the
domestication that we have.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk about
an extreme example, if we can.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
A flower I understand.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You touch a flower,
and then you have

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.425 align:middle line:90%
the perception of a flower.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you see something
like abuse, and then you see,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hate animal abuse,
and I hate abusive people.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I close my
eyes, that still exists.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Yeah, but because
it's already in your brain.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My perception
of it is real.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Mm-hm.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but you have to
see that is the result

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:90%
of all the domestication.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when you was growing up,
our parents say, this is bad,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:90%
this is Violence is not good.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's abusive.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:90%
We qualified everything.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we already have
that in our mind.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Could be a truth or not.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, it's
not really important

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:90%
if it's true or is not true.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But what is in our mind is not
real, but is based in reality.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Because let's say
your parents exist,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
they really exist, but the
ones who exist in your mind,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, is just a
projection of what is real.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you create your reality
with all those images

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.665 align:middle line:90%
based in reality.

00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you just said it.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You can create a
different reality.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.375 align:middle line:90%
And you qualify.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
You can say, this is bad.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I hate this, I love this, I'm
indifferent to this, et cetera,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But this is your creation,
it's the story where you live,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and you are the main
character of that story.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And you use the word in
order to create the story.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Then depends how you
use the word is how

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:90%
you're going to live your life.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
If you are impeccable

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
your life will be

take it to the next step

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:90%
was not to take it personally.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you really look
at that situation,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
which appears to be
real, and then you

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%

that we're involved and
participate in all those dramas

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%

misusing the word.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:90%
But either way is our reality.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Now other

they do exactly the same thing.

in their story.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%

They don't know you.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:90%
the way you judge them.

That is the perhaps the
easy way to understand what

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We compare and judge,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And we try
to please everybody

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to avoid that judgment, and
we would put ourself at last.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We sacrifice ourself for
so many different things.

to not take it personally,
to not make assumptions.

We humans, we have so
many wonderful ideas.

And with the action,
we manifest the ideas.

We have computers.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:90%
We went to the moon.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We create great things that
can build so many things,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%

destroy everything.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%

we hook the child's attention

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and introduce these rules
into his or her mind.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
As children, we didn't
have the opportunity

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
to choose our
beliefs, but we agreed

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
with the information that was
passed to us from the dream

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:90%
of the planet via other humans.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I call this process the
domestication of humans.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We trust what we
believe, and our beliefs

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.535 align:middle line:90%
set us up for suffering.

00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In the dream of the planet,
it is normal for humans

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to suffer, to live in fear,
and to create emotional dramas.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Our personal dream can also
become an ongoing nightmare,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
where we suffer and
live in a state of fear.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to
dream a nightmare.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
enjoy a pleasant dream.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:10%
There are thousands
of agreements

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:10%
you have made with
yourself, with other people,

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:10%
with God, with society, with
your parents, with your spouse,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:10%
with your children.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But the most
important agreements

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are the ones you
made with yourself.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
In these agreements, you
tell yourself who you are,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
what you feel, what you
believe, and how to behave.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
One single agreement
is not such a problem,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
but we have many agreements
that make us suffer,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that make us fail in life.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live a life
of joy and fulfillment,

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
you have to find the courage
to break those agreements that

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
are fear-based and claim
your personal power.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:10%
When we're finally ready
to change our agreements,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:10%
there are four very
powerful agreements

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:10%
that will help us break those
agreements that come from fear

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:10%
and deplete our energy.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:10%
You need a very
strong will in order

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:10%
to adopt the four agreements.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you can begin
to live your life

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:84%
with these agreements, the
transformation in your life

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
will be amazing.

Tell me about the
fifth agreement.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: It's be skeptical,

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:10%

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:10%
the moment comes I shall really
live in these four agreements.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:10%
Shall not pretend that you are
living the four agreements.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
fifth agreement start.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Be skeptical, but
learn to listen.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Be skeptical doesn't
mean that because you

feel that you are more
intelligent than anybody else,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:90%
you don't believe what they say.

No, not at all.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You are skeptical
because you don't

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:84%
take whatever they say is true
for them, but not true for you.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.462 align:middle line:84%
They give the message

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you can take what works

what it doesn't work for you.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important

Many times almost from
the very beginning,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:84%
you know that you will not
get anything from there.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:84%

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.465 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference.

00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Because if they
hold your attention,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:90%
they will give a message to you.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you can make a
choice, you want to listen

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.325 align:middle line:90%
or you don't want to listen.

00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you learn
to listen it's

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
because they really
hold your attention

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and there's something that
could be good for you.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:84%

hear what they say.

They can have great ideas.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, that works for me.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But then you also hear
superstitions, mm-hm,

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't work for you.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But you listen anyway,
and you respect it

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:90%
because it's the way they are.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
They can believe
whatever they want to.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not your problem.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
They create their own story.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They're domesticated
in their own way.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They believe whatever
they believe.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that it's
good or bad or right or wrong.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just a point of view.

something very
interesting happen.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
That will means that is
the end of your world,

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:84%
the end of your reality,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

Imagine Jesus in

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:90%

Siddhartha is in the Bodhi

If you let me control you, we
can be very happy all the time.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But if somebody
tells you, I love you,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
you let me control you, you
will say, oh, wait a minute,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.560 align:middle line:90%
no one will control me.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But we want control
everybody, but we

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be controlled.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why does
human nature do that?

00:34:06.866 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
Why does human nature
need to control?

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Because we learn, we
was domesticated that way.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And then that's the way we love.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.719 align:middle line:90%
I love you if.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%
That's the way they love us.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
They love us if we
let them control us.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:84%
But the worst part
is that we learn

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to love ourself
exactly the same way.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I love myself if, if
life becomes the way

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I wish to be according
everybody else's opinions.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you have
that level of self-love,

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:84%
you don't need that
validation so much.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then when you
understand this point,

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:84%
now you can understand easily
all the violence in the world,

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:90%
you can understand war.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
We can understand that
everybody's in a war of control

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:90%
with everybody around them.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And even with themselves
they have that war of control

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
in their own mind because
they cannot control themselves

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:90%
according of what they believe.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Believe in.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking at
the news with the hate

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:90%
crimes that go on all the time.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are
committing these hate crimes

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
have these demons,
these inner demons,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.510 align:middle line:84%
or these resolutions that have
never been made and grievances,

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and they cannot get beyond that.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And for the people
that it happens to,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you tell them not to
take it personally?

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
tell you, yes, I'm

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.745 align:middle line:90%
going to take this personally.

00:35:40.745 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, that's
the only way they know.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.857 align:middle line:90%
This is OK.

00:35:44.857 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But what is important at least
is to understand the point.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And a way you can see
that the result of that

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.133 align:middle line:84%
is the creation of
those three questions.

00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK, so there's the
newest book that you have

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:10%
called "The Three Questions."

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:10%
>>RUIZ: "The Three Questions."

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it applies
to "The Four Agreements."

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Oh, definitely,
because we can say our goal

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:90%
or wish the way we want to be.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:84%
These are questions that
we have since millennials.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A long time, yes.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: What am I?

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:90%
What is real?

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.207 align:middle line:90%
And what is love?

00:36:30.207 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
the three questions.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: The three questions.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are questions that
are changing all the time.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What am I?

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:90%
What is real?

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:90%
What is love?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.915 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: What is love?

00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the answers to those
questions are ever changing?

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, to
answer those questions,

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:84%
we use the most wonderful tools,
which is these five agreements.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Then when we're using
these five agreements,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:90%
we are changing our reality.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is changing
anyway just by itself.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if I'm
asking what is real,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I go back to the four
agreements and I say, well,

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:90%
am I impeccable with my word?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.465 align:middle line:90%
Am I taking things personally?

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:13.465 align:middle line:90%
Am I making assumptions?

00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, those
are the tools.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.056 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But to see what is real,
in order to get the answer,

00:37:21.056 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
first you have to
see what is not real.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And to answer what
is not real, now you

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:90%
use these five agreements.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the tools.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, I see.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me an example of
how this would work in life?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: OK, let's say
you are 12 years old, OK?

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:90%
This is your reality.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.870 align:middle line:84%
In that reality, of
course you're real.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:84%
You have your name, everybody
tells you what you are,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
you believe you are.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Then that school
where you go is real,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.520 align:middle line:84%
your parents, your family is
real, all that is real for you.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All the conditions
around you are real.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: And love is conditional.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.065 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Mm-hm.

00:38:14.065 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Then using these
four agreements,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:84%
you are doubting
about all of that.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then when
a crisis happen,

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:25.515 align:middle line:84%
something that is not
exactly what you want,

00:38:25.515 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:90%
now you put in doubt.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you are in a
lecture, in a big conference.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you go blank
in front of 1,000 people.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
You just get out of
there, you go by yourself,

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and now you start
judging yourself.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Look at why I do that,
why should I said that.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm this, I'm that.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.330 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:90%
You are judging yourself.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mistake, embarrassment,
all of that happens.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: You feel that maybe
it is the end of the world.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:84%
How can everything keeps going
when this happened to you?

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.650 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel stupid, I'm this, I'm
that, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the four
agreements, I still

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
just say no and will
help you to recover

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
from that little crisis.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.903 align:middle line:84%
It would be catastrophic
in your mind otherwise.

00:39:30.903 --> 00:39:31.736 align:middle line:90%
And you can really--

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:32.736 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: And you recover.

00:39:32.736 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You can work through it,
and these are the tools

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.743 align:middle line:90%
on how to work through it.

00:39:36.743 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: This crisis that
happened in our life.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:84%

Well, I am stupid.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.215 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would use
the four agreements

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:90%
to then override that and say

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Just had to say no.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
mistake or whatever.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:90%
when my husband, my son die?

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's very painful.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:90%
But is that real?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It looks real.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.795 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Is what religion
tell me is real,

00:40:18.795 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
what moral tell me is real?

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.572 align:middle line:90%
Am I real?

00:40:23.572 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
take a great example.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:90%
So I lost my father.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were married
for almost 60 years,

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and they were together
since they were 13.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They were the only
couple, that they only

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
knew each other for 60 years
in terms of being a couple.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:90%
They were bonded at the hip.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So my father's
passing has really

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:84%
affected my mother, where she
feels that she's lost herself.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Of course.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is very common
with people, who die shortly

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
after their loved ones,
because a whole piece of them

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.850 align:middle line:90%
goes missing.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Of course.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What could
I tell my mother?

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't take it personally?

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.047 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: No.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Just love her just the
way she is, and it's OK.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:90%
That's all she needs, yes.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's wondering,
who am I without him?

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do I tell her?

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: You are always
you, and it's OK,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to have the pain.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.660 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to overcome whenever.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And to let her know
even if she understand

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:84%
or not that, well, the image of
your father lives in her mind,

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that she can keep
communicating with him,

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:47.360 align:middle line:84%
talking to him knowing that the
body is gone because he doesn't

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
live anymore, but all the image
that she have for all those 60

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:90%
years is still there.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, very much.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And of course,
she can hold his hand.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the hardest
part is the touch.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the hardest part,
yeah, for everyone.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: She need to the touch,
but she do it in her own time.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Then the only thing is just
too love her, to support her.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:18.395 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, it's fine, and do
the best you can for her.

00:42:18.395 --> 00:42:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But that goes to
the third one, what

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is love, because that would take
you for what you really are.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:84%
In order to answer that, you
need to see what love is not.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Is your jealousy love?

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Is your control issues love?

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm just thinking of
someone who maybe loses a child

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:84%
or loses a sibling, and
they can't touch that child

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.218 align:middle line:90%
or the sibling any longer.

00:42:55.218 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was just about
to ask you that,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
but you answered it to the
question of what is love.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, love is everlasting.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Yes.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The love of that child--

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Is eternal.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eternal.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And the love of the
sibling is eternal.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Love is life itself.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.840 align:middle line:90%
It's pure energy.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%
It's unconditional.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can we love the
people that do the hate crimes?

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Can we love the
wrongness in the world?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we don't
have a choice, really.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.675 align:middle line:90%
We can judge them, and we do.

00:43:32.675 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And we can get mad.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Mm-hm.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And we can get angry.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But you can do something
that could be very interesting.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You can get out and see
everything from the top.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see how humanity is only
one made by billions of people

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:90%
and have a whole story.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:08.285 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has a beginning
and will have an end.

00:44:08.285 --> 00:44:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Then by seeing humanity
that way, you take one human

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and you see the whole destiny
of humanity in only one human.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole steps you
see the one human.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So with all of humanity
and morality and immorality,

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:90%
you see one human.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Yes.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From that perspective.

00:44:27.905 --> 00:44:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: From that perspective.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And you see that all humans
are exactly the same.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.250 align:middle line:84%
What will change is
what they believe.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We're born, we grow up,
we reproduce hopefully,

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:90%
we get old, and we live.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.650 align:middle line:90%
We live through a body.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And the story also has a
beginning and has an end.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Then it begins
when the brain get

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:84%
more mature that we can
hook with our attention,

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.710 align:middle line:90%
we can create a whole reality.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But that will depends of
how the brain function.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Perceives
it, really, yes.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Because there may come
the day when the brain is no

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:84%
longer good enough--
we can say it that way,

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:90%
that's not exactly correct--

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the reflections
are not the same,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:90%
the mind is not the same.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:90%
We can forget things.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is dissipating
little by little.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment that
the brain stop working,

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:84%
we no longer reflect
the outside reality.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:90%
The mind is gone like that also.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yes.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: If you see
a mirror, everything

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that is in the mirror
is a copy of everything

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:84%
that is outside of the mirror,
but could be so clear that you

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.940 align:middle line:90%
think it's real.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to touch
something, but you only

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.120 align:middle line:84%
will touch the
surface of the mirror.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.412 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great example.

00:46:18.412 --> 00:46:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: It is exactly the same
that our eyes and our brain.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, interesting.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: If you break the mirror,
it's not reflecting anything.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's shattered, yes.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then when the
brain doesn't work anymore,

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:84%
there's no more reflection,
there is no more mind.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
The mind is gone, but
the body can still alive.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all about
changing your perception.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It takes strength
to do something

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.428 align:middle line:84%
like this, a
different perspective.

00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Your reason is gone,
the judgments are gone,

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.325 align:middle line:90%
belief system is gone.

00:46:57.325 --> 00:46:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
a clean slate.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But your
body can still alive.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And that may happen to many
of us after certain age.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is
a great video here

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look
at talking about humanity,

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and it really could
be the solution

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.870 align:middle line:90%
on how to change the world.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Look at Don Miguel
talking about this.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: I come with you
to asking you a favor,

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:34.518 align:middle line:84%
and the favor is, please
help me to change the world.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.938 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:36.938 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't refer to
the world of humanity.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean the world
that you create,

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:84%
your own creation, your world
that is only true for you,

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:59.320 align:middle line:90%
but for nobody else.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You create the
story of your life.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
You create an entire reality
that is only true for you.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:14.920 align:middle line:84%
There is 6 billion people in
the world on this planet Earth,

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:84%
6 billion people who
create their own story.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I can say 6 billions of artists
because we all are artists.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We create.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I create my personal world,
the world of Don Miguel Ruiz.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just a story.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not even real.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.580 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, it's not true.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Like your story is
not true either,

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.770 align:middle line:90%
but you believe it's true.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:84%
You create your own story,
and we live in that story.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's so perfect that we
don't notice that we live

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:90%
in the story that we create.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:84%
In that story, we create
multiple secondary characters.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Every person that you
know and many others

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know, but you
know about them, all of them

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
world in your world.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
part in your creation

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is the main character, and
that main character is you.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You create the main
character of your story,

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
story is about you.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:84%
In my story, the main
character is Miguel Ruiz.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:middle line:90%
But he's just a character.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.750 align:middle line:90%
He's not even real.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But my whole story
is about Miguel Ruiz.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It's how Miguel Ruiz
perceive everything.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.875 align:middle line:84%
It's about how Miguel Ruiz
believe about everything

00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:09.675 align:middle line:90%
he believes.

00:50:09.675 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's just his point of
view, and that point of view

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:90%
is changing all the time.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Just like in your own
story, your point of view

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:90%
is changing all the time.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so true.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So how can we
create a new story?

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:33.750 align:middle line:84%
How can we do that if we
really already created

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.090 align:middle line:90%
this life as our story?

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:90%
So can we recreate it?

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Oh, definitely.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The way we want to?

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Definitely.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.943 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
whole point, right?

00:50:42.943 --> 00:50:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
After the fifth agreement,
where you no longer believe

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:84%
all your lies, when you learn
to respect yourself completely

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and you can respect everybody
around you completely

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and accept them just
the way they are,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.260 align:middle line:90%
now your story is different.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And now you, the main
character of your story,

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.850 align:middle line:90%
it becomes an ally.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's helping you to live
in this personal paradise

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.810 align:middle line:90%
that you just create.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And you no longer really
belongs to everybody around you,

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.240 align:middle line:90%
but you understand them.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:84%
They will not understand
you, but it's not important

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.590 align:middle line:90%
if they understand you or not.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if somebody is
sick and they're creating,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that's essentially a story
that they're creating

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.740 align:middle line:90%
of a sickness, of a sick body?

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, the
body gets sick.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.286 align:middle line:84%
Even if we don't want to,
the body will get sick.

00:51:48.286 --> 00:51:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm, interesting.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: When all the
organs start failing,

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.260 align:middle line:90%
the body will get sick.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
If we get an infection,
the body will get sick.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.320 align:middle line:84%
If we have an accident,
we break the spine,

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.630 align:middle line:90%
the body will be sick.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:90%
2002 I have a heart attack.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I almost die.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I was nine weeks in coma.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: I come back, and my body
was not the same any longer.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.270 align:middle line:84%
My body was in
pain all the time.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Nobody noticed.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
my body was in pain.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:90%
But I want to live and to enjoy.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew that my body
was like an old car,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's taking me
any place I want to.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had so much
love for this body.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I take care of my
body the best I can.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Doctors tell me that I may
live one year, maybe two years.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was almost
seven, eight years.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Long ago, yes.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And I decide
to have a new heart.

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.558 align:middle line:90%
Then I have a new heart.

00:53:05.558 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You got an
entire heart transplant.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Yes, in 2010, I
have a heart transplant,

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
eight years later.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And now it's 2009 and I'm
still in my physical body.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And yes, my body's
been sick, but we all

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.898 align:middle line:84%
will die for one
reason or another.

00:53:24.898 --> 00:53:26.856 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you don't
create a story around it.

00:53:26.856 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Of course I'm not.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:37.885 align:middle line:84%
I didn't create the bones of
my body, and nobody really do.

00:53:37.885 --> 00:53:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They chastised them so many
times because they get sick.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, so what?

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.300 align:middle line:84%
If I can live the way I can
live, someone with cancer

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.810 align:middle line:84%
can live with that cancer until
the body just kick him out.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To not create
a story around it.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Yeah.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And let's say that we are sick.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It's nobody's fault,
not even our fault.

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no one to
blame about for that.

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to apply this to
everything, so money, finances.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Say someone is devastated,
financially broke,

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.880 align:middle line:90%
can't make ends meet.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Are they creating
a story around it?

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be the circumstances
that made that happen?

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, let's say
that they make choices,

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and those choices
have repercussions.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of
choices they made.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that someone
got addicted going

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:40.940 align:middle line:90%
to alcohol or anything else.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.310 align:middle line:84%
The result will be that
sooner or later, they will

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:47.230 align:middle line:90%
lose whatever they had before.

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's a result
of their decisions.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:53.540 align:middle line:90%
There's no one to blame.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So did they
create a story around it?

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Of course they
create all the stories.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.430 align:middle line:90%
They blame everybody else.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:90%
It was not me.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And believe the stories.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: They believe it,
of course, which is OK.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.590 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with that because it's

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.970 align:middle line:90%
in our nature we create stories.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We are storytellers.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.500 align:middle line:90%
We are dreaming all the time.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Until you
rise above it and get

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.710 align:middle line:84%
into a different
perspective, and then you

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:84%
start to look at, as
you said in that video,

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:27.040 align:middle line:90%
we are the artists of our story.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
instruments to do it.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the four
agreements, and we

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.390 align:middle line:84%
see what we want to paint,
what we want to create,

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:39.320 align:middle line:90%
which is this three questions.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Constantly
recreating, that's

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.107 align:middle line:90%
how you recreate your story.

00:55:42.107 --> 00:55:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: It's changing
all the time.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.858 align:middle line:84%
Then the answer of that
question when you have 12

00:55:46.858 --> 00:55:48.900 align:middle line:84%
will be different than
the answer of the question

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:54.650 align:middle line:84%
when you are 16, then
when you just get married,

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.910 align:middle line:90%
when you have your children.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.430 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.120 align:middle line:84%
All those questions keeps
changing and changing.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same,
but it's guiding you

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.983 align:middle line:84%
in certain directions
of your creation.

00:56:05.983 --> 00:56:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
great questions.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: But you have the tools

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.330 align:middle line:90%
you're going.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To continue to ask.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.605 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask, through
all you have been through,

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:19.400 align:middle line:84%
through the heart attack and the
heart transplant and everything

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that you've written
about, what fuels you?

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:30.860 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest why that
you do what you do, Don Miguel?

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, I do
that because of love.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything is really about
love because I am love and love

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:90%
goes with me wherever I go.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.840 align:middle line:84%
If I gave a message,
it's because I love.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's not important if people
receive it or not receive it.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They could put everything
I say, put in the trash,

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:56.380 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:01.330 align:middle line:84%
What make me happy is to
share, to give, to create.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
why, if there's

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:07.570 align:middle line:84%
any why, because there's
really no reason.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:10.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just because I love.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I treat myself the way I
do because I love myself.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I treat you the way I treat

You can really recreate.

00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand this
perception that we can actually

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:37.810 align:middle line:84%
truly change our perceptions
and then recreate our stories,

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.340 align:middle line:90%
all that is left is love.
