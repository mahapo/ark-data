00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:10%
And today, we're
talking to Stephen

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Simon, producer, director,
and Hollywood child actually.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:10%
And this is going to be a
really fun conversation.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Steven is the son of a
director, Sylvan Simon,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
who made 46 films
in 13 years, which

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm really impressed with.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have a conversation

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
about history of
Hollywood, new Hollywood,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual Hollywood.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So how you doing today, Stephen.
-Good.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.361 align:middle line:84%
And I read your book--
-Thank you.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:10%
---this weekend.
-Thank you.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful book.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.951 align:middle line:84%
And I did not know any of
the stuff that was in there,

00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew a little bit about
your "Somewhere in Time"

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
experiences and Chris
Reeves, and all that.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea
your father was

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
a top director in Hollywood,
worked for Harry Cohn.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And why don't you tell
us about your dad?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, my dad, Sylvan Simon,
was a director and a producer

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood in the '40s.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:10%
He actually came out
to LA in the '30s

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:10%
and made movies with-- he
made a lot of comedies.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:10%
He made movies with Red
Skelton, who was his best friend

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and collaborator, who I wound up
calling Uncle Red as I grew up.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And Milton Berle, I was
probably the first person

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to call-- or one of them
to call him Uncle Milty,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
because I was supposed to call
all of my dad's friends uncle.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But he was friends with the
Marx Brothers and Milton Berle

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and Abbott and Costello.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And all of those folks wound
up at our house-- I remember,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:10%
when I was three, four
years old-- on Sundays.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:10%
So my dad made a movie
with Lana Turner.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And my dad also bought
"From Here to Eternity,"

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:10%
the novel that wound up
saving Frank Sinatra's career.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how much of that
story you want to get into.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.036 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I want to get into that.

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to let
you go that easy.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But let's get back to your
dad before we get into that,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
because he made-- I've seen at
least two of your dad's films.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I saw "The Fuller Brush Man."

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.665 align:middle line:84%
And I saw "The Fuller Brush
Woman," which I thought

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
was better, by the way.
I thought that--

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:90%
With Lucy.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
---Lucille Ball, her comedy
on that movie really--

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
probably what aged

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:90%
her and got her career going.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
That was one of her
first launches, yeah.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen
a lot of the others.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I looked up his filmography.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.194 align:middle line:84%
I probably have, because I
was a film freak as a kid

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and watched everything on TV.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see Abbott
and Costello in Hollywood?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I saw all of them.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, those, of course.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:90%
They were great.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So your dad was a
really hard-working guy.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who does that many
films in that short of time--

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.691 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, if you could
do two films in a year,

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:90%
it'd be amazing.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but almost nobody
does two films each yeah.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg
occasionally tries it.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone once in a while,
but usually it's one.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But back then, it
was a different--

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
that was the studio system.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And you went from one film to
another film to another film.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like you
chose your films the way

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
they do today.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
You were kind of
assigned your movies.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
went and did that.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:90%
There was A units and B unit.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the '30s,
when my dad started,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
1939 was the high
watermark for Hollywood.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.965 align:middle line:90%
650 movies were made in 1939.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The greatest year
for cinema ever, 1939.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
"Gone with the
Wind," "Wizard of Oz."

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a Ford movie
in there, "Stagecoach."

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.855 align:middle line:90%
"Stagecoach," yes, right.

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he was right
there at the peak, when

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
LA was really the
nicest city in America,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and movies where the best.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the studio
system, because I'm really-- I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.701 align:middle line:84%
think I would have fit well
into the studio system.

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Me too.
Me too.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, because it
gave you the creativity.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But it gave you the security
that they don't have now.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
insecurity that Hollywood

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
has now adds a lot
to the kind of fear

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:90%
kind of movies that they make.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I often wonder what a
historian 500 years from now,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at movies from the '30s,
and then movies from the '70s,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and then movies from today,
would think about what happened

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to this country that
produced these movies,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because the movies are so
wildly different than they

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:90%
were in the '30s and '40s.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
For lack of a gentler
way of putting it,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the inmates took
over the asylum.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:10%
What happened was, during
that period of time,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:10%
during the heyday of Hollywood,
the titans-- Irving Thalberg,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Harry Cohn,-- even though he
was a pretty horrible man,

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:10%
as I talk about in my book, made
great movies-- Darryl Zanuck,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:10%
and all of those people,
they-- and particularly,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Louis B. Mayer, the people
that ran the studios.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And they ran them
with an iron fist.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:10%
They knew exactly
what they wanted.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:10%
But these people loved movies.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:10%
That was their passion.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:10%
That's why they came from New
York in 1915, 1920, '25, '30,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:10%
and started to make movies,
because they loved movies.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:90%
And they loved movie people.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And they lived it.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And they breathed it.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And they understood the
creative risk it was.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to
deal with actors.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to
deal with directors.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
time, when I said,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
if you signed to a
studio, they told you what

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:90%
movie you were going to make.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And you went.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved
that period of time

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
too, because you went from
movie to movie to movie.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And you did the best.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't work out,
but it didn't really matter,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:90%
because you kept working.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
What happened in the
'50s-- and I mean,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
this is a much longer
story than you're

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:90%
going to want to go into today.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But what happened in the
'50s is that Jimmy Stewart--

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and he was the first one-- got
a profit percentage on a movie.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to shift
because the old, powerful

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
moguls started to move away.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:90%
They started to get older.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They started to retire
and started to die.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
came in behind them

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
were more business-oriented
and not really focused

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
on the creative
aspect of movies.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
The best example is during
that period of time MGM,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Louis B. Mayer would
say, all right.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:90%
We're making a movie.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And if his marketing
person would say to him,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.401 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not really sure how
to market this movie Mr. Mayer,

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
he'd say, fine.
You don't have a job today.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
You're fired.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll get somebody else tomorrow
who's going to market it.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
This is the movie we're making.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, the marketing people
have basically veto power--

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:90%
The veto powers.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:90%
---over what happens.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's much more
a corporate mentality.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know a
lot of the people that

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
are still there,
because I spent 25, 30

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:90%
years making Hollywood movies.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole corporate
mentality has taken over.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And the cost has
become so exorbitant.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.811 align:middle line:84%
It's over $100 million to
make an average Hollywood

00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:90%
movie today.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the marketing money--
it's a different business.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
going for the home run.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going for the
Burger King tie-in.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And the littler move,
the story-driven movie,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the movie that's about
real human beings

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and about real people,
it's just harder

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and harder to do that today.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I read a book recently
by Edward Jay Epstein

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
about Hollywood and
how they're really

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
only interested in selling
popcorn now at theaters.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So since people our
age aren't generally

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
going to buy a bunch of
candy bars and popcorn,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
they have to make
movies that appeal

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:90%
to people between 15 and 25.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And let's face it,
that's not exactly

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:90%
your most formative years.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.656 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
quality of the movies

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
has dropped rapidly actually.
-Oh, it has.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And they've stopped making
movies for every audience

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:90%
spectrum too.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the last three
months of the year, October,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
November, December, we
start getting movies that

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
have some significance to
them, some meat on their bones,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
some spirituality to them,
some real drama, because that's

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
qualifying for Academy Awards.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that
those movies were

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:90%
opened all during the year.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's only about
three months a year.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is folks like you

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and I have gotten out of the
habit of going to movies.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll never get out of
the habit, because it's

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
my passion and my addiction.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.931 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people have
gotten out of the habit

00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
of going to movies.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, when all these movies
come out at the same time,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
they can't go see all of them.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them fail.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see,
the older audience

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.401 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really want the movies.
---make it.

00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But you shoved 50
films at us at once.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And we can only go once
a week or twice a week.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:90%
So they're guaranteed to fail.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see so
many remakes getting made.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in 2012, they just
made a remake of "Spiderman,"

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:90%
the original "Spiderman."

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.419 align:middle line:84%
The original was only
made 15, 16 years ago.

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:33.184 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was that long.
Was it?

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:90%
I think was the late '90s.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was even 2000.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The original was only
10, 12, 15 years ago.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
make another one.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
Why?
Why?

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a new
generation of 12, 13, 14,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
15-year-olds, who will
go back and see the movie

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
get, frankly,--

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
forgive my language--
so much crap,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
because the people who are
running the studios today,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
many of whom are well-meaning
people, are MBAs.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They're really
about the business.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And show business is both.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It is a business.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:90%
It's always been a business.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's about show as well.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It's about creativity.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's about taking risks.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about taking chances,
and pushing the envelope,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and giving people
something that they really

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:90%
relate to in their hearts.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting very
little of that nowadays.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my agent in
Los Angeles told me

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.345 align:middle line:84%
that he's not quite sure-- I
won't mention his name so I

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
don't get him in
trouble-- he's not

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
quite sure if the people
running the studios

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:90%
know how to read anymore.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't think they do.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Because he says he
gives them scripts,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and he can tell they
haven't read it.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're going for graphic
novels and comics, something

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that's easy for them
to grasp and understand

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:90%
and quick to read.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're only picking--
there's not that many original

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
screenplays anymore either.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.064 align:middle line:84%
Everything's a derivative now.
-It is.

00:09:50.064 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:10%
But that's when
you see something--

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:10%
and I know we'll talk
about more current movies,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:10%
but now when you see something
like "Silver Linings Notebook,"

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:10%
which is out this year,
which is so incredibly

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:10%
original and daring
and creative and smart,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:10%
it's like, oh my god, they
still do make movies like that.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:10%
But not very often.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
to the directors.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have, like
your dad directing so much.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
You become very
familiar with the tools.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can't possibly--
Spielberg can,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:90%
because he made enough films.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But you really have
to make four or five

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
films before you
really start figuring

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.141 align:middle line:90%
out the language of film.

00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it's really
hard for anyone.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, even you.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
You should have
been able to make

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:90%
eight or nine, 10, 12 films.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And you never did.
-As a director?

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%
As a director.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as a
director, I made two.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
As a producer,
I've done about 20.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You've had a good
producing career.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
First, you worked with
Dino De Laurentiis

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and Ray Stark, and
all the top people,

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get to soon.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back to your
dad, because your dad

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly fascinating.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Your dad bought
the book property

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:90%
"From Here to Eternity."

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:90%
He did, indeed.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And thus began one
of the biggest dramas

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:90%
in Hollywood history.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It sure did.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you tell
us your view on that,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:84%
because the way you found
out about this is shocking.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
extraordinary story.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happened.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
My dad bought, "From Here
to Eternity," as a book.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:90%
James Jones was the author.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
They paid $50,000
for it, which was

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:90%
an enormous amount of money.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
This was 1949 that they
actually made the purchase.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They started
developing the movie.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And my sister, who
is a film critic

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
actually back East,
now, Susan Granger,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
remembers this very well.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:90%
I was three or four at the time.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:90%
So I don't remember it well.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But Susie was almost
12, and James Jones

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:90%
was in the house a lot.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a huge
Frank Sinatra fan.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of
people don't know

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is that Sinatra, at
the end of the '40s,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
was very much down
in his career.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:10%
He had hemorrhaged
his vocal cords.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:10%
He really wasn't singing,
couldn't really sing.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:10%
He'd made, as he later explained
it to me, a couple of really

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:10%
bad movie decisions,
where the movies had gone

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:10%
into the toilet, as he said.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And he really was down
on his luck in many ways.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And my dad called him
in and said, look,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
we've bought this book.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The part of Maggio in
this is great for you.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd love you to
be in this movie.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And my dad, at that point,
was an executive, a producer,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and the head of production
at Columbia under Harry

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Cohn, who ran the studio.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So Sinatra read the book,
called my dad, said,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to do this.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Dad said, great.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd be thrilled to
have you in the movie.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Dad was going to
produce the movie.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And Harry Cohn
vetoed him and said,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:90%
no, Sinatra does not work here.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to get the job.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
My dad called Sinatra and
said, I can't do this.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And Harry vetoed me.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm resigning.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.245 align:middle line:84%
And my dad quit the studio
that day and went home.

00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Next day, he got a panicked
phone call from Harry Cohn,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:90%
saying, come back.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Give Sinatra what he wants.
All right.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Fade out.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So my dad, unfortunately,
after that,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
within six months of that, had
a cerebral hemorrhage and died.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was just before
my fifth birthday.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And Dad was just 40.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:90%
And I remember it.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
From my fifth or
sixth birthday on,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
these incredible gifts

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:90%
from Uncle Frank.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
told to call Sinatra.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And every year for my
birthday, for Christmas,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I'd get these great gifts.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
When I was 18
years old, so 1964,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I got called to Sinatra's
house up in the hills

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:90%
above Beverly Hills.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing
in his driveway,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
sitting, leaning on the
hood of a 1964 Corvette,

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%
silver Corvette Stingray.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And I pull into the driveway.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And he flips me the keys.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And he says, happy
birthday, kid.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's yours.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, it's yours.
He said, come in.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:90%
So I went into his house.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It's where I first met Jilly
Rizzo, who many people may know

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
as a restaurant tour
leader, but who was really

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Frank's right-hand
guy and a Damon

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Runyon character
from day one, just

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
an extraordinary character.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And Frank explained the story
to me in the following way.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know, listen.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Your dad was a
real stand-up guy.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:90%
He got me this part.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
This part changed
everything for me.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Sinatra wound up winning
the Academy Award for it,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
getting best supporting
actor for it.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it changed
my whole career.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:90%
It resurrected my whole career.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And your dad really
stood up for me at a time

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:90%
that very few people would.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I never got a
chance to repay him.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm here for you.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I've given
you all these gifts.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm 18.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
This happened 14 years before.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, here's
a card with my phone

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
number, my private
secretary, my number.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Any time you get
into trouble,-- and

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.201 align:middle line:84%
if you think I'm going to
tell that story on television,

00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not.
-Good.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't ask.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's in
the book, "Bringing

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Back the Old Hollywood."

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
You can read it in the book.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not telling that story.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very scandalous.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I eventually did
get into trouble.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%
But Sinatra was there.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he took me to Vegas.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
He took me everywhere.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And he did it until I
was in my late '20s.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So for about 25 years, Sinatra
really saw part of his role

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:84%
as being kind of a
surrogate father.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to
see me as a godfather.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what that
meant at that time.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This is way before
"The Godfather."

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was, as many
people have said,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the most charismatic,
extraordinary people.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was privileged to spend
20, 25 years of my life hanging

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:90%
out with him from time to time.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:90%
We were never friends.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:90%
He never confided in me.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
He was an idol to me, like
he was to other people.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was an extraordinary
experience of my life.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGING]

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Ah, isn't that nice?

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.561 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:11.745 align:middle line:84%
All right.
Start talking.

00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:14.892 align:middle line:84%
Uh, I was sent by a
friend of Johnny Fontaine.

00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
His friend is my client,
who would give his undying

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
friendship to Mr.
Woltz if Mr. Woltz

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:90%
would grant us a small favor.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Woltz is listening.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Give Johnny the part
in the new war film

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
you're starting next week.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.755 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:38.145 align:middle line:84%
--[CHUCKLES] And, uh, what favor
would your friend grant Mr.

00:16:38.145 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Woltz?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna have
some union problems.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
My client could
make them disappear.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Also, one of your top
stars has just moved

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.725 align:middle line:90%
from marijuana to heroine.

00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
-Are you trying to muscle me?
-Absolutely not.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.316 align:middle line:84%
Now, listen to me you smooth
talking son of a bitch!

00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:52.416 align:middle line:84%
Let me lay it on
the line for you

00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
and your boss, whoever he is.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Fontaine will
never get that movie!

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how many daigo
guinea wop greaseball gumbahs

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
come out of the woodwork!

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm German-Irish.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you
something my Kraut-Mick friend.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm gonna make so
much trouble for you

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.557 align:middle line:10%
you won't know what hit ya.

00:17:07.557 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.256 align:middle line:90%
I have not threatened you.

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I know almost every
big lawyer in New York.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.354 align:middle line:90%
Who the hell are you?

00:17:12.354 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I have a special practice.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I handle one client.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, you have my number.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait for your call.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
-Check him out.
-All right.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So one of the best movies
ever made, "The Godfather,"

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:90%
by Francis Ford Coppola.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And your father was one of
the central dramas in that.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:10%
So the story for me ends 1968.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm 22 years old by that time.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And Sinatra had a
house in Palm Springs

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that I used to go to
from time to time,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
be privileged to go
to from time to time.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:90%
He invited me down.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
We would fly to Vegas
from time to time.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was in Palm Springs.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a movie
theater in Palm Springs

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and saw Red Skelton,
who, I mentioned before,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
had been my dad's best
friend and collaborator.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't seen
him, and he hadn't

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:90%
seen me since I was four.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:90%
So now, it's been 18 years.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I found out later
there was a big

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:84%
falling out between him and my
mother after my father died.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, but there was.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And Red kind of
disappeared from my life.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So I knew he wouldn't
know who I was.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:90%
But I felt compelled.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to him, and I
said, excuse me, Mr. Skelton.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me with
big tears in his eyes.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was a very
emotional guy, Red Skelton.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And he said, my god.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Your Sylvan's boy.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So I assume I looked
a lot like my dad.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.137 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, I am.

00:18:44.137 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
are you doing here?

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.069 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk.

00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:48.771 align:middle line:84%
And we went-- he was with his
wife Georgia at that time.

00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were still
together at that time.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We went to a coffee shop
or a little restaurant

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
near the theater.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me
what I was doing.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I've spent
a lot of time with Sinatra,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.386 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:18:58.386 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
looked at his wife.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, how much
do you know about that story?

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just
know that dad got him

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:90%
the part, and stuff like that.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well
you know, maybe it's

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.250 align:middle line:90%
time you knew the whole story.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
what is the whole story?

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way Red
explained it to me.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.035 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no firsthand
knowledge of this.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
This is just what
Red Skelton told me.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It was 1968.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But he told me that Sinatra had
gotten this role, that Harry

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Cohn went crazy, that there
was an issue with Sinatra

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and a young woman whom
they both coveted.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's why my dad quit.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, even though
Mario Puzo and Coppola

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
had it being as dramatic as
a horse's head being cut off,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
according to Red, what
happened is that Harry Cohn did

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:84%
own a racehorse, a very
prominent racehorse.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And that night, the horse
was poisoned in its stall.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a note put under
Harry Cohn's door in his house,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
which basically
said, you're next.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's what scared him.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And then he freaked out.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my dad-- as Red
said to me, as far as he knows,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
my dad never actually
really even knew the story

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
that that's what had happened.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
He was just kind
of brought back in.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And he died so
quickly afterwards

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
that he probably did not know.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that that
story is exactly what happened.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But I do know this, Red Skelton
told me that story with a lot

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of heart and a lot of passion.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said there was a
reason that Sinatra treated

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:90%
me the way he did for 25 years.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.765 align:middle line:84%
And then I later went
to Ray Stark, who was

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
a dear friend of my parents.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And Ray Stark had produced
"Funny Girl" and "Funny Lady."

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And he had actually
been my dad's protege.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.374 align:middle line:84%
Ray was one of the great
producers in the film industry.

00:20:59.374 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into
the film industry,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.806 align:middle line:84%
I actually started
working for him.

00:21:01.806 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is many years before.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Ray.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Ray, Red
told me this story.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as far
as I know, yeah.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I don't
think anybody's

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:90%
ever going to confirm it.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But he said, from what
I know and from what

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I know from the people
at Columbia at that time,

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and from what Red
told me and told

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:90%
your dad, yeah, that's true.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So what was your
reaction when you first

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.321 align:middle line:84%
saw the movie, "The Godfather?"
-I was shocked.

00:21:30.321 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll bet.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked, because when
the moment came that I got

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
in that trouble that Frank,
to his great delight,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
got me out of, he and Jilly
were kind of-- I said,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:90%
well, how did you do this?

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of winked at Jilly
and said, well, I made the guy

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:90%
an offer he couldn't refuse.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what that meant,
because that was also 1968.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:90%
'69.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
When the movie came
out, I was shocked.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to say,
in all fairness

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
here, Frank hated that.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%
He hated being Johnny Fontaine.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:90%
He said it wasn't true.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
He said there were so
many things in that movie

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:90%
that weren't true.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
He really hated being
portrayed that way.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So I, for many--
I mean, I would've

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
never talked about this until
long after Frank's death.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:10%
I would have never done
anything to embarrass

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:10%
him, because I'm
just so grateful

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:10%
to him and to his family.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.494 align:middle line:84%
And Tina and Nancy
were-- I'm not

00:22:23.494 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
going to say close
friends of mine,

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
but they were certainly
people that I knew

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and that I would
consider friendly with.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's been a long enough
time now that I felt that it was

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
really appropriate for
me to tell the story,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's a wonderful
Hollywood story.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's incredible.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I wonder where Mario Puzo got
all of this knowledge now.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, he
was onto something.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Those are good films.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
But they're not great films.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So Harry Cohn, he
got your dad started.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And then that got you
going into movies.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And you went to
work for Ray Stark.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And then after that
stint, you decided

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to buy a property from one of
my favorite writers, Richard

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.699 align:middle line:84%
Matheson.
-I did.

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I actually begged my way in.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.307 align:middle line:90%
I was a lawyer.

00:23:15.307 --> 00:23:16.939 align:middle line:84%
[WHISPERING] I was a lawyer.
-I can't believe it.

00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
--[WHISPERING] I don't
talk about that a lot.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to go
to meetings anymore.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.285 align:middle line:84%
And no one would ever want
me as a lawyer then or now.

00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:90%
No lawyer jokes.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:90%
No, no lawyer jokes.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I spent a very brief
period of time as a lawyer.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I wanted to get
into the film industry.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:90%
It was just in my blood.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I went into a
bookstore in Beverly

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Hills, called Martindale's,
which is long since gone.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the book clerk said,
you should read this book,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
because I know you
like Richard Matheson.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was a book called
"Bid Time Return."

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
And I read this book.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, now I've got
to get into the film industry.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Ray
Stark, who had been

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
my dad's protege, who was a
very close friend of my mother.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And Ray's wife,
Fran, who is Fanny

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Brice's daughter--
that's how Ray

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
got the idea for "Funny Girl."

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Fanny Brice and my mother
were very close friends.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Ray, and I
begged him to give me a job.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I've read this book.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I need to start getting
into the film industry.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Ray was very hesitant, because
my mother was a Jewish mother.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
He was a good friend.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, so you
want me to tell, Harriet,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
your mother, that I am
taking her Jewish son out

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of the practice
of law and putting

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
him in the movie business.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was like--
he made me a deal.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And we started.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I developed "Smokey
and the Bandit,"

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
which was my first film
that I'd ever worked on.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I worked on the
"Goodbye Girl"--

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Huge hit.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But the very first thing I
did was call Richard Matheson.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
for those of you

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:84%
who may not know
the name Richard

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Matheson, Richard wrote so many
great books-- "I Am Legend."

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:10%
He wrote this book,
"Bid Time Return."

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:10%
He wrote other books as well.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.454 align:middle line:10%
Also the real good episodes
of "The Twilight Zone."

00:25:02.454 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about a third of
"The Twilight Zone" episodes.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:90%
The good ones.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Some really great ones.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote Steven
Spielberg's first movie,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
"Duel," which really kind
of shot Spielberg in.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And the very first thing
I did on my very first day

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in the film industry was to
call Richard Matheson's agent,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
set up a lunch with him,
meet him, and tell him

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I had read this book and that
if he gave me a couple of years,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd figure out a way
to produce the film.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And then three years
later, that wound up

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:90%
being "Somewhere in Time."

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:10%
And that wound up being my
first film as a producer

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:10%
and the first of two films that
I collaborated with Richard on.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:10%
That and then "What Dreams
May Come," 20 years later.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:10%
And Richard became kind
of my spiritual mentor

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:10%
and a surrogate father to me.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, like they say, if
you want to be successful,

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:10%
start with a good script.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, Richard Matheson
is one of the best writers,

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I think, America's
ever produced.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the
great storytellers.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was
watching an interview

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
with Ridley Scott and Charlie
Rose, I think, a few years ago.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie Rose said,
what's the hardest

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
part about making a movie?

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And Ridley Scott said
something I'll never forget.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, writing the script.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.511 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Matheson wrote
some really good scripts.

00:26:15.511 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
-He did.
-He did.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So you made your first
significant film,

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.651 align:middle line:84%
"Somewhere in Time," which
is now a cult classic--

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It is.
---and a really good film.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know what another
definition of a cult classic

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is?
-Huh?

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
A movie that bombed
when it came out,--

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.165 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but now
people remember it.

00:26:35.165 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Which "Somewhere in Time" did.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And it really kind of totally
broke all of our hearts.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:90%
It broke my heart.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I grew this.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
When "Somewhere
in Time" bombed, I

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.814 align:middle line:84%
kind of went into my
house for two months,

00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and didn't come
out, and grew this.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And I've never shaved it since.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what Al Gore did after
he lost the election in 2000.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.707 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what I felt like.

00:26:51.707 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I'd really kind
of-- I have to tell you,

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
speaking of that,
Michael Cimino,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
who was a wonderful director,
who made "Deer Hunter,"

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
made a film called
"Heaven's Gate,"--

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Which they're now
digitally redoing.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
---which is known to be one of
the great bombs in the history

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:90%
of the film industry.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.766 align:middle line:84%
Which is actually
a pretty good film.

00:27:10.766 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a really,
really good film.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But it destroyed United
Artists when he made it.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is when I was
working with Ray Stark.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
a big fan of his.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had dinner
with him one night.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about "Heaven's Gate."

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
Michael, what did

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that feel like when
that all just fell

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:90%
apart after the "Deer Hunter?"

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was just chilling.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know
what I felt like?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I felt like Houdini might
have felt, wrapped in chains,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
thrown to the
bottom of the river,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and when you get to the
bottom of the river,

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:90%
you forget the trick.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I kind
of forgot the trick.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And I never forgot that.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was just
an extraordinary thing.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, he got
really unnecessarily

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.305 align:middle line:10%
burned by that whole thing.

00:27:56.305 --> 00:28:00.691 align:middle line:10%
I only saw it once, but it
was really a very good film.

00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:10%
-It was.
-It came out at the wrong time.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Reagan had just got elected.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a subversive plot
about the rich cattle barons.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't think he
ever could have had a chance

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in that political atmosphere.
-Well, and listen.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Also, sometimes--
"Somewhere in Time"

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
came out at the wrong time.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:10%
It came out in the
"Saturday Night Fever"

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:10%
era, and things like that.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And it was a little movie
out of place and out of time.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
A little slow.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It was a very, very slow.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It was purposely done that way
to be a kind 1940s melodrama,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:90%
the way it was done.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful story--
and I don't know if you want

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
to get into it-- about how we
got Chris Reeve for that film,

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:84%
but it really wound
up being something

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:90%
that I was incredibly proud of.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It was the kind of movie
that I really wanted to make

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:90%
from the time I was a kid.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.151 align:middle line:84%
You know, I grew up on movies
like "Lost Horizons" and things

00:28:52.151 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I love those films, which
Hollywood called fantasy films,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
but what I really thought
as spiritual films.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's really why when I
read "Bid Time Return," which

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:84%
became "Somewhere in Time,"
why I wanted so desperately

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to make that as my first film.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it is a wonderful
spiritual love story.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And it did take some
time for it to catch on.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:90%
It bombed when it came out.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The critics were waiting
for Chris with sharp knives.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And they went after him.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And the film disappeared for
maybe three or four years.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
what happened

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
with it, because
I always thought

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:90%
it was a wonderful love story.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
All of us involved
loved the film.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And we never could quite
figure out why it happened.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But things happen the
way they're supposed to.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And a young guy in LA
named Jerry Harvey--

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if you
ever knew Jerry Harvey-- was

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the programmer for one of the
very first pay cable channels

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:90%
ever called the Z Channel.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Oh, Z Channel,--

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:10%
Z Channel was one--

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:10%
---the single greatest
channel that ever existed.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:10%
He was just a genius.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.154 align:middle line:10%
And he loved
"Somewhere in Time."

00:29:58.154 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:84%
He had been one of the few
people to see in the theater.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.511 align:middle line:90%
So when he got the Z Channel--

00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
He put it on all the time.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:84%
---he started putting--
and then HBO picked it up.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And it got a life of its own.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And got a call from
Universal maybe six,

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:84%
seven years after the
film came out, saying,

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:84%
what is going on
with your movie?

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we're
selling videocassettes.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And then a guy named Bill
Shepard, who worked at Hughes

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Aircraft, called Richard
Matheson and I one day

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and said, I want to start
a fan club for this movie.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
call it INSIGHT,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
the International Network of
Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And he started a fan club, which
is still going on to this day.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:84%
They publish a quarterly
newsletter about the film.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a film
that's now 32 years old.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And every October, at the end
of October, at the Grand Hotel,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:10%
where we shot the
film, the fan club

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:10%
takes over the entire
hotel for a whole weekend.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:10%
Like "Lord of the
Rings" or something.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:10%
And people come dressed
in 1912 costumes.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:10%
And there are trivia contests.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:10%
And they show the film.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:10%
And it's a weekend devoted.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So those of you who have always
loved "Somewhere in Time,"

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I just want you know
that-- go to the Grand

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Hotel website, grandhotel.com.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And you want to go to the
"Somewhere in Time" weekend.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.305 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a-- and
it's really wonderful.

00:31:15.305 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I went there finally for the
first time about 10 years ago.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And the state of Michigan
had gotten together

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:84%
with the local people and had
put a plaque down where Chris

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Reeve first meets Jane Seymour.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And it says on this plaque, on
this place on June 28, 1912--

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
which was the time in the
film-- Richard Collier first

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:90%
met Elise McKenna.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a permanent
place in the film.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going down
there for the first time

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and just sitting
down there and really

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
crying, because it took so
long for the film to catch on.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But now-- and it's not like it's
ever going to be a huge hit.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But boy, the people
who love it really do.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I would rather
make films that people either

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:90%
love or hate.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the worst
thing is to make a film

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that people say, oh, it was OK.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Then you haven't done anything.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've made some
movies that people hate.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who
just find "Somewhere in Time"

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
boring and pretentious,
and all kinds of things.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And I respect that.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm so proud of that.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And then "What Dreams May
Come" is a whole other story.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, it holds up really well.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I watched it a few months ago.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:90%
It really holds up really well.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't age.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't aged at all, in fact.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of a
timeless love story.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So you would hope
that it wouldn't.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, your films, both
the ones you've directed

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and the ones you've
produced, they

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.166 align:middle line:84%
remind me a little bit
of Peter Weir's work.

00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:40.865 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:32:40.865 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, that's
an incredible compliment.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That's an incredible
compliment.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:90%
"Picnic at Hanging Rock" and--

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually tried to get
Peter Weir for years.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
"Picnic at Hanging Rock"
and "Last Wave," which are

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:84%
his two first Australian
films, are, I think,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:84%
two of the most unsung
incredible movies.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And then Peter went on
to do "The Truman Show,"

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other films.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Which is another great film.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
get Peter for years

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
to make "What Dreams May Come."

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a huge
Peter Weir fan.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I don't
know how to do it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge challenge.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole other story.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a huge challenge.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't even
imagine how you did that,

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:90%
because I read the book before.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
this is impossible.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And usually, Matheson
books aren't impossible.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:90%
They're very cinematic.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But you picked that book, and
you managed to pull it off.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, it took 20 years.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
We probably had every
studio and every director

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood turn it down
two or three different times.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Spielberg was interested even.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg was
interested at one point.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I explained that
story in the book.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work out
for various reasons.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And we just kind of went on.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And it took 20 years.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the right
confluence of things

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
came together for us
to be able to make it.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
challenging thing.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Vincent Ward, who's a
wonderful New Zealand director,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:84%
was brave enough to
take on the film.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you say to
a director you've

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
got to actually
show an afterlife

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and show several different
afterlife experiences

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and make them feel real.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Peter
Weir, who was really

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:84%
lovely during the
years said to me,

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do this.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love the story.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I just frankly don't know
visually how to do this.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And Vincent, who had made some
wonderful films in Australia

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.199 align:middle line:84%
and in New Zealand,
that were somewhat

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
art films, when I
first saw him actually

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:90%
turned the film down twice.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:90%
And then he called one day.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have
figured out how to do it.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down
with him, Ron Bass,

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
who had written the
screenplay, and I and Vincent.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want to
make the wife a painter.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:10%
And I also want to make
her a curator at a museum,

00:34:54.550 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:10%
because this whole after
world life can be wet paint.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:10%
And he will be the only
kind of live thing in it

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:10%
that isn't blended
in with wet paint.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And he went into this
incredible description of what

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:10%
this world would be like.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And I remember Ron Bass and
I were sitting there just

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:10%
with our tongues hanging out.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And we said, my god,
Vincent, that sounds great.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you know how to do that?

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:90%
He said, hell no.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
But we'll figure it out.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the great
things about filmmaking.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know how to do it.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:90%
But he figured it out.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I would say
that that's probably--

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Stanley Kubrick, I asked him
once, what's your job title?

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, problem solver.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I just go from one problem
to another all day long.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
He's also one of my favorite
directors of all time.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he is my
favorite director.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:middle line:84%
He also said that
being a director

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is like being the
waiter at a Jewish deli.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Salami, yes.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Mustard, no.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.311 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
All you do is you're
just making thousands

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of decisions every day.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Having directed a couple of
films myself, that is true.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You make-- and it's something
that people don't understand.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you just show up, and
you work with the actors.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.320 align:middle line:84%
You make literally hundreds,
if not thousands, of decisions

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:90%
every day about everything.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fascinating job.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a really
interesting, fascinating job.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:10%
I have to say that producing
and directing "Conversations

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:10%
with God," the film version
of "Conversations with God"

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:10%
was the most fun I've
ever had in business ever.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, my family, to me,
that's the most important thing.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:10%
But in my film career,
that was the most fun,

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:10%
because Neale Donald Walsch
was a dear friend of mine.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:10%
He entrusted that to me.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.770 align:middle line:10%
I know you're a friend
of Neale's as well.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And it had been such a
great story, another film

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that I'd wanted to
get done for 10 years.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And we finally figured out
how to be able to do that

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and actually how
to make the film.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And that 25 days of shooting--

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.120 align:middle line:90%
25-day shoot?

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:84%
-25 days of shooting,
-That's short.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
---was the most fun and
is a film, again, that did

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:90%
not do well when it came out.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's a film that I'm
very, very extremely proud of.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
come around now.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And people are
going to eventually--

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.755 align:middle line:84%
a couple of friends of
mine have said to me,

00:37:10.755 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, Stephen, you're
ahead of your time, which

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be a compliment.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But then another friend
of mine said to me,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.090 align:middle line:84%
you know what being ahead
of your time really means,

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Stephen?
I said, what?

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're wrong.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
You're wrong.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.320 align:middle line:90%
You're wrong all the time.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:90%
You're wrong.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just some
time in the future,

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people kind
of see it differently.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But don't get yourself into,
oh, I'm ahead of my time.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:90%
You're wrong.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of keeps the
humility in the situation.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're one step ahead of
the crowd, you're a genius.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.361 align:middle line:84%
If you're two steps ahead of
the crowd, you're a crackpot.

00:37:40.361 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, there you go.
-So there you go.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So then you went from
"What Dreams May Come,"

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
which I don't know
if it was a big hit.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:90%
But it was a mild hit.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:90%
It did well.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:90%
It did well enough.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And the movie was
way too expensive.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But it did almost $100 million
around the world in box office.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And it won an Academy Award.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost-- you
were at the infant of CGI

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:90%
when that film came out too.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.540 align:middle line:90%
We were.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.406 align:middle line:90%
It was the infancy of it.

00:38:06.406 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:90%
We were.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.087 align:middle line:84%
So you really
stretched the limits.

00:38:09.087 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it won
the Academy Award for.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It won for its visual effects.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.486 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it got a standing
ovation when I saw it

00:38:15.486 --> 00:38:18.070 align:middle line:90%
at the theater the first time.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a really good film.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And then that got you off
onto the spiritual cinema

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and a whole new adventure, an
attempt to apply metaphysics

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to cinema, which sounds absurd.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you
think about, movies are

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:90%
light projected onto a screen.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.545 align:middle line:90%
And you're sitting in the dark.

00:38:38.545 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And movie theaters used to look
like Roman coliseums and stuff.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's always been
kind of a mystical aspect

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to movie-going.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So it really isn't all that
absurd to think that you could

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
create spiritual cinema,
spiritual movies that affect

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:84%
people and maybe even
initiate them even

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:90%
into higher spiritual concepts.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is why I got
in the film industry.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
what I wanted to do.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And all kidding aside, I
have known some successes.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I've also known
a lot of failure.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:84%
My career has gone south
at least a couple of times.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I had a bankruptcy once,
lost everything that I had

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and had some young kids
I was raising on my own.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a challenging times.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've been through those
dark nights of the soul.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I never really fit into
the whole Hollywood.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was a
child of Hollywood,

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I just never really fit
into the social scene

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:90%
or the political scene.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was our mutual
friend, Neale Walsch,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
who actually got me out of LA,
had me move to Ashland, Oregon.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, the spiritual
things you want to do,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you can't do when you're
in LA in that industry.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to get out of there.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Ashland.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Neale encouraged me to write
a book about spiritual movies,

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
which I argued about with him.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm not an author.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be able to do this.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one day, he
got really upset with me.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, Stephen, you're
going to write this book.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You want to argue
with my source?

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, sir.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll write the book.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote my first
book, which is

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:84%
called "The Force is with
You," about mystical movies.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
around the country,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
started talking about it,
and had the vision for doing

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:90%
something with spiritual films.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And my dear friend Gay
Hendricks and his wife Katie

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:90%
became really big supporters.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And one day, Gay came to
me and said, hey, listen.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I know you want to do
films, theatrical stuff.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you think
there are enough really

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
good spiritual films out
there that we could kind of

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:90%
do a subscription movie club?

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think the Spiritual

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Cinema Circle was my idea.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.400 align:middle line:90%
It was Gay's idea.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And when he said, are there
enough movies out there,

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I felt like an actor,
who is asked, hey,

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:90%
can you ride a horse?

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.737 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is of
course I can ride a horse.

00:40:57.737 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Are there enough
movies out there?

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.336 align:middle line:84%
Of course there are
enough movies out there.

00:41:00.336 --> 00:41:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And that in the end of 2003,
and then in March and April

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of 2004, was the launching of
the Spiritual Cinema Circle

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:84%
here at Gaiam, which we're now
going to start our 10th year.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We have subscribers in
every state of the union,

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:90%
in about 80 foreign countries.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And we send out
four movies a month.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're all inspirational
and powerful and uplifting.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have discussions,
which we shoot

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:90%
in this studio, every month.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an
extraordinary thing in my life.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:84%
It is really what I think
my life has been really

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.100 align:middle line:84%
leading to, which is being able
to distribute these movies that

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.290 align:middle line:90%
have been made by other people.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've distributed over 400
films now to our subscribers

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:90%
into our community.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.120 align:middle line:10%
So I want to urge
you, if haven't looked

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:10%
at the Spiritual
Cinema Circle website,

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:10%
spiritualcinemacircle.com,
please do.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.200 align:middle line:10%
It's wonderful having
it hear at Gaiam.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Gaiam's been very supportive
since Gaiam bought

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:10%
the company a few years ago.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's really been a wonderful
experience and continues to be.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So what's your criteria
for a spiritual film?

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we've had
a lot of issues with the word

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.910 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, because a lot of
people in mainstream society

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:84%
consider the word spiritual
and religious to be synonymous.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we say spiritual,
we mean of the human spirit.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
We mean, we don't do anything
that's denominational.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
We won't do anything
that is critical of

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
or supportive of any
particular religious faith,

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
but movies that really kind
of exalt the human spirit.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's really a
difficult thing to pin down,

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
but movies that make you
feel better about being

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
human after the film is
over than when it started,

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and movies that show who
we can be as humanity when

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:90%
we operate at our very best.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
This is usually three
shorts and a feature,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:90%
sometimes a documentary.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And the criterion
that we have for that

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:84%
is not that it just
be pollyannaish,

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
because, boy, we've done some
tough subject matter-- child

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.995 align:middle line:90%
abuse.

00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We did a film about
someone who had

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
inadvertently run
over their own child

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:90%
and killed their own child.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't do things that
are just necessarily light,

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
although we do do
comedy as well.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be
a pathway through it.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And we don't do
anything that's violent

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:90%
that would be more than PG-13.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't do anything
gratuitously sexually.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
sound like Gaiam TV.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
they're synergistic.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:90%
So you know it should.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it should
be a part of that.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And the films that
we put out are

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
films that every
month we really feel

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:90%
will make people feel better.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think if people
go to the Facebook page

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:84%
for Spiritual Cinema
Circle, they're

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.651 align:middle line:84%
going to see our subscribers
talking about the films

00:43:49.651 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:90%
every month.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I have a filmmaker
come in and a subscriber

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.410 align:middle line:84%
come in every month and
discuss the films with me.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And we get wildly different
opinions of things.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
wonderful little oasis

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.081 align:middle line:84%
of uplifting and
transformational films

00:44:04.081 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:84%
for people.
-Yeah, it is.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a needed thing to
have right now in this world

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, which there
aren't a whole lot of films

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
that fit that description.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I must have missed
some of these films,

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
because I watch a lot of films.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And most of them do not
make me feel better when

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm done watching the film.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's--
the wonderful thing

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
for us is that there are so many
movies out there that get made.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Shorts get made
because one person

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.990 align:middle line:90%
has a passion to make them.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
few outlets for them.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've now gotten to a
place where a lot of people

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.735 align:middle line:84%
are making shorts for us,
because they know that we're

00:44:43.735 --> 00:44:45.640 align:middle line:90%
a distribution outlet for them.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of features
that get made that, as you well

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:90%
know, don't get distribution.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
The sad fact of
making movies today

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:58.652 align:middle line:84%
is that one out of every
200 movies that gets made

00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:90%
makes its way into a theater.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:90%
One out of 200.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, they
have to make their money back

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.950 align:middle line:84%
from various deals,
including licensing it

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:84%
to us at the Spiritual Cinema
Circle for the one month

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that we put it out or
for digital rights,

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:84%
which we make available
to them, which

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful distribution
platform to distribute

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
through Gaiam TV, which is
another wonderful thing we

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.010 align:middle line:90%
can now offer to people.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And the films, I think,
surprise people every month,

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.865 align:middle line:84%
because they've
never heard of them.

00:45:30.865 --> 00:45:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of them
when I take a look at them.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're with actors
a lot of the time--

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we have
recognizable actors.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times, not.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're films that you
haven't heard a lot about.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.380 align:middle line:90%
So they can still surprise you.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the wonderful things

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:45.895 align:middle line:90%
about our movies every month.

00:45:45.895 --> 00:45:47.251 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I've never
heard of that movie.

00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:47.950 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of fun, or that's
very touching, or that's

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:84%
very moving, or it's
very controversial,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.180 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it might be.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a really
great service.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Over 12,000 films
submitted to Sundance

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:90%
this year for 150 choices.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.959 align:middle line:84%
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

00:46:02.959 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
there's 11,850 films out

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.890 align:middle line:84%
there that are probably never
going to get distributed.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:90%
And we may never see them.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're like a pioneer, going
in and finding these films

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them
out to the audience.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So in your opinion, what's the
most metaphysical or spiritual

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:90%
film ever made?

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness, my goodness.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cop out,
because there's no way.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:84%
This is like I have this crusade
about the Academy Awards,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.300 align:middle line:84%
saying Best Actor, Best Actress,
which we can talk about.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
you can do that.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about favorite.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.345 align:middle line:84%
For me, in my opinion,
there are a few, because it

00:46:47.345 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:90%
just kind of depends.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you the
one that woke me up,

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, was
"2001, a Space Odyssey."

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It woke me up too.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.410 align:middle line:10%
The last 15 minutes,
20 minutes of that film

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.970 align:middle line:10%
changed everything for me.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:10%
Same here.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.010 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the
most metaphysical,

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:10%
spiritual, extraordinary
experiences

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:10%
that's ever put on film.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, wow.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.090 align:middle line:10%
I saw that when I was
22, Cinerama Dome Theater

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:10%
on Sunset Boulevard in LA.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:10%
That was a great theater.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:10%
And it changed
everything for me.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:10%
But certainly, "2001" is
the one that got me going.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.070 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, same here.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.720 align:middle line:10%
Very much so.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.110 align:middle line:90%
So what about today?

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:84%
What movies today do you
think are coming out that are

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:90%
interesting in that aspect?

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Say this year.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.577 align:middle line:84%
So this has been, I
think, surprisingly the end

00:47:36.577 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of the year-- of course, the
first eight or nine months

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.287 align:middle line:90%
were pretty grim.

00:47:40.287 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple of
movies that I loved,

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:84%
"Hope Springs," which I
think is a wonderful film.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:84%
"Best Exotic Marigold
Hotel" is a wonderful film.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But you know, as you and
I are recording this,

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.617 align:middle line:84%
we're in that time of
the year where the movies

00:47:53.617 --> 00:47:54.450 align:middle line:90%
are starting to come out.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, I've been
a member of the Academy

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:90%
since 1984.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So I get to vote.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I consider that
a real privilege

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the 6,000 people
to get to vote on the Academy

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Awards every year.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, they send
us all of these movies,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.050 align:middle line:90%
these year-end movies on DVD.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So we get 50, 60, 70 movies in
these last two or three months.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting there
busily watching everything

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:90%
that we can watch.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I still love to go to
theaters to see films.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But my favorite film so far
this year-- and I haven't seen

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
all the films for
this year yet--

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:84%
is "Silver Linings
Playbook," which I just think

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.320 align:middle line:90%
is an extraordinary movie.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:90%
A little bit like a Peter Weir.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It is so original
and so creative.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Good acting.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Great acting.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Bradley Cooper is fabulous.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:10%
Jennifer Lawrence is fabulous.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:10%
Robert De Niro is the best
I've seen him in years.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:10%
It's such an
unusual, unique film.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.740 align:middle line:10%
And it has such a great heart
and such a great sense of humor

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.340 align:middle line:10%
and such a great
sense of romance.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very strange
story about two people who've

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.950 align:middle line:84%
been through emotionally
devastating experiences

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, who
basically lost it.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they basically went
through periods of time

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
where they really lost
control of their emotions

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
wind up meeting

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:90%
and helping each other heal.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a great film.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I love that film.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:14.969 align:middle line:84%
I loved "Argo."
-"Argo?"

00:49:14.969 --> 00:49:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen "Argo."

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought "Argo" was
a fascinating movie.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.634 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was great.

00:49:19.634 --> 00:49:21.200 align:middle line:84%
There are some movies
that haven't come out yet

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that I want to kind
of alert people

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to-- "A Late Quartet," which is
with Christopher Walken playing

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's not crazy,
which is something different,

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and Philip Seymour Hoffman,
which is about a string

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.120 align:middle line:84%
quartet in New York, which is
very much about what happens

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:84%
when you're a great artist
and age catches up to you,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can no longer do what
you've done your entire life.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
very powerful movie.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful movie.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that
to people a lot.

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:90%
I loved the James Bond film.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was great.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.490 align:middle line:10%
I loved "Lincoln."

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:10%
I think "Lincoln" is wonderful.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.840 align:middle line:10%
I think that Daniel Day Lewis
is going to win the Academy

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:10%
Award for Best Actor.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Although, I think it
should be favorite actor.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's talk about that.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is
something that I waged

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.010 align:middle line:90%
a crusade with in the Academy.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, I've had
absolutely no success,

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.967 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:50:14.967 --> 00:50:16.300 align:middle line:84%
That's because they
want it to be best.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm two steps ahead.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm the crackpot on this one.
-You are.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.180 align:middle line:90%
No success.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Because to me it's
like saying, OK,

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.010 align:middle line:84%
what's the best
painting in the Louvre?

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the Van Gogh is
better than the Manet.

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't say that.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It's what moves you.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So I can't every year vote for--

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And what time that you
saw it to, your mood and--

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.101 align:middle line:84%
So I can't any year say, well,
this was the best performance.

00:50:41.101 --> 00:50:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to compare
Daniel Day Lewis playing

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln to
Bradley Cooper playing

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's just been through
this emotional experience

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.251 align:middle line:84%
in his life?
You can't.

00:50:53.251 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:84%
-It's not even fair.
-It's not fair.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there's a lot
of politics in the Academy.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
jealousy in the Academy.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:05.300 align:middle line:84%
People don't always vote for
what they think is the best.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most recent
examples I can give you--

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a great way
to kind of synopsize this--

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:14.490 align:middle line:84%
is that a couple of years ago
James Cameron was nominated

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.800 align:middle line:90%
for Best Picture for "Avatar."

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, "Avatar" is one of
the game-changing movies

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.890 align:middle line:90%
of the last 100 years.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely "The Jazz
Singer" of the 21st century.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly that.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's exactly that.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly "The Jazz
Singer" of the 21st century.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.844 align:middle line:90%
That's a great way to put it.

00:51:29.844 --> 00:51:31.510 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who don't
know, "The Jazz Singer"

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:32.950 align:middle line:90%
was the first talking film.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know that's
an achievement on film

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that nobody in the
world could have done--

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Or will ever do again.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:90%
---or will ever do again.

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, an extraordinary thing.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:43.987 align:middle line:90%
So he gets nominated.

00:51:43.987 --> 00:51:44.820 align:middle line:90%
But they don't like him.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's remember
that's also the biggest

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.180 align:middle line:90%
grossing film of all time.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it bumped the
other film that

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.470 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest grossing
film of all time, "Titanic,"

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:90%
also made by James Cameron.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So he's now made the two biggest
grossing films of all time.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:06.470 align:middle line:84%
He gets nominated for Best
Director and doesn't win.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Who wins?

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:84%
His ex-wife, whose
name-- and I'm sorry.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm blanking on the name.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.387 align:middle line:90%
Bigelow.

00:52:12.387 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Katherine Bigelow.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to remember
the name of the film.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:15.840 align:middle line:90%
"The Hurt Locker."

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.880 align:middle line:90%
"The Hurt Locker," thank you.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880 align:middle line:90%
A very vicious film.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and "The Hurt Locker"
five years from now--

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.227 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not taking
anything away from--

00:52:22.227 --> 00:52:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm with you all
the way on this.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:23.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Five years from now,
nobody's going to know

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.340 align:middle line:90%
what "The Hurt Locker" was.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You and I have a hard time
remembering the name of it.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.470 align:middle line:84%
"Avatar" is going
to stand forever.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But the Academy was not going
to give him the Academy Award

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:37.240 align:middle line:90%
with all of the other things.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
happened in the past.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember the year.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.950 align:middle line:84%
John Wayne made the
last film of his life

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and won the Academy Award
the same year that Dustin

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Hoffman made "Midnight Cowboy."

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they were going
to give it to John Wayne.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, of course they were.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Taylor
won for "Butterfield

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:02.410 align:middle line:84%
8," which was probably her worst
performance in her worst film.

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:84%
But she had just been
through her tracheotomy

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and through all the tragedies.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted-- so it happens.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, so there's
a lot of politics.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But still, that
being said, to me,

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.180 align:middle line:84%
movies are such an
incredible art form.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm honored to be
a part of that.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm honored to be a
part of that industry.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And even though that they don't
always go the way that maybe

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.390 align:middle line:84%
people think we
should go-- and I

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of wish that the
Academy Award show

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:90%
were no longer on ABC.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I wish it was on basic
cable or something

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.680 align:middle line:84%
like that, so they didn't
have to worry about ratings.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.280 align:middle line:84%
This year they're
having Seth MacFarlane,

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.720 align:middle line:84%
who is the guy behind
"Ted," host it,

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to get 15-year-olds.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And listen, I have
a 16-year-old.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We have six kids, my
wife and I. I have

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:90%
nothing against 16-year-olds.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I love you, Carter.

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
entire audience.

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And Academy Awards
is about class.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It's about dignity.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about movies that
we want to represent us

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:84%
around the world as being
the best or the most

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.470 align:middle line:90%
favorite of our art form.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.380 align:middle line:10%
And I wish we could get back.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.140 align:middle line:10%
I wish we could get back
to that time in which

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:10%
it was really just
about the performances

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.680 align:middle line:10%
and the accomplishments
and things like that.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, ratings
and money and all of that

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:27.160 align:middle line:90%
have kind of swept it away.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a sad note
to end this discussion,

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:35.251 align:middle line:84%
because I have nothing but high
hopes for Hollywood and movies.

00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that good
movies continue to be made.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Me too

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:43.061 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for stopping
in with us Stephen Simon,--

00:54:43.061 --> 00:54:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Me too.
Let's do it again.

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:45.450 align:middle line:90%
---the producer and director.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And thanks for watching.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And we will do it again.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.290 align:middle line:90%
