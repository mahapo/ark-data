>>LISA GARR: You might know
my next guest, Dr. John Gray,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
as a relationship expert and
author of the bestselling book,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
"Men Are from Mars,
Women Are from Venus."

But what you may
not know is John

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is a 50-year meditator, who
studied sacred techniques

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:90%
with the Maharishi.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
He was a celibate monk
who lived with Maharishi

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:10%
as his personal
assistant for nine years.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%

something that you

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:10%
created over your years.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAY: Well, Maharishi taught
me transcendental meditation.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:10%
That was really big.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:10%
It still is, around the country.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
The Beatles had gone to India.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had been in my room
listening to the Moody Blues.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And my mother walked in, and
she was in awe of this music

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
because they had this "Om."

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And my mother was a meditator.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And so she saw me.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.422 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting there,
listening to music.

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
She sat down,
meditated next to me.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
And I got really high.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then she saw the
poster on my wall.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of Jimi Hendrix
posters and the whole thing.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
one of the Beatles,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
with Maharishi
sitting in the center.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
So she said, who's that?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But she had such
excitement about it.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I was curiosity
about meditation.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.943 align:middle line:84%
And then a few days
later-- synchronicity--

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I was at the bowling alley,
and somebody said to me,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's a samurai
warrior demonstration.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
You should go upstairs.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went, wow, because I was
in martial arts at the time.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I went up looking for
a martial arts demonstration,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and it was a transcendental
meditation seminar.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So my friend got the word right.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But when I heard the talk,
the basic, introductory talk

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to transcendental meditation, it
just rang a bell inside of me.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like I was born
to hear that talk.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
home two hours late,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
my dad said, so
why are you late?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And he thought I was off
with friends or something.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.707 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I went to the talk.

00:02:09.707 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
what did you learn?

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.682 align:middle line:90%
And I gave the whole talk.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I could still give
that whole talk.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's right written in my heart.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.347 align:middle line:90%
It was a destiny for me.

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those things where
all the bells in Heaven rang.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I learned to meditate.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:90%
I did transcendental meditation.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It's where you close your
eyes, and you repeat a mantra.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And you just repeat the
mantra over and over and over.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you fall asleep,
or you go deep inside,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but afterwards,
you feel refreshed.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And it still works for people.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's still wonderful.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:90%
But some people today--

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
they do it, or other
forms of meditation,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and they get bored with it.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.255 align:middle line:84%
They don't get the
benefits right away.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:44.255 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a struggle.

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:45.547 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The monkey mind starts.

00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And the mind starts
going around and so forth.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And particularly women, not so
much men-- but still, many men

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
get bored with it or
don't see the point of it.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.415 align:middle line:84%
But many women are trying,
and they're trying.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go to India,
where a lot of these techniques

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
were developed,
mantra meditations--

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
repeating a mantra-- if
you ask women in India,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.725 align:middle line:84%
do you meditate,
they go, oh, no.

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It's too difficult--
too difficult

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
because my mind is
jumping around too much.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And back in the day, when
Buddha was teaching meditation,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Shankar was teaching
meditation, all these--

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:90%
where it came from--

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
primarily, it was taught to men.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was taught
to men because it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:90%
helped strengthen masculinity.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
To empty the mind is the
opposite of opening the heart.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Women were to open
their heart to increase

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the female energies, for
women to find their ground.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And for men, if they
got too emotional,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
like angry or
aggressive or whatever,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
they would learn to
empty the mind, detach--

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.743 align:middle line:84%
so the whole thing of
learning detachment.

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out-- now that
we have modern science-- when

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
you learn to empty your mind,
your testosterone levels

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
will start to rise.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's good for men.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.882 align:middle line:84%
But for women, if they're
trying to empty their mind,

00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and they need to get over
to their female side,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:90%
it may not be as productive.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look at yoga
classes today-- you know,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
actually, my dad taught me
yoga at three years old.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: We had seven kids,
and he put the mat out.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And Houston, Texas--
who would've thought?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing our yoga
postures as little kids.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went to
India, I was so proud.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to India.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting up to do my yoga.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:90%
All the yogis do it alone.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a solitary thing.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever you're
alone, you're male hormones

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:90%
get produced.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
When you connect with
others, your female hormones

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
get produced.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And for men, particularly,
they need way

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:90%
more testosterone than women.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So meditation was a
way you did alone.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:90%
You did yoga postures.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.913 align:middle line:90%
You did that alone.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.246 align:middle line:84%
Today, you see all the women
going to the yoga studios--

00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: --but they're
doing it together.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And they're doing
it to beautiful music.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it with
someone guiding them.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Guided meditation
stimulates estrogen.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Whereas doing your own thing,
repeating a mantra over

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and over and over,
calms the mind

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:90%
if you need more testosterone.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take
meditation techniques,

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and you look at what's happening
today in the world, women,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
particularly, are way
on their male side

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and often can't get back
to their female side.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So to do a technique
that helps produce

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
testosterone,
emptying the mind, can

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
be very boring and difficult
and challenging for them.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.333 align:middle line:84%
They don't get the
immediate benefits.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Some women do, but not all.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So being an expert on gender
differences in this whole thing

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that I do for the last 40
years, and then before that 10

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
years just teaching meditation
and being with the Maharishi,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I was able to recognize a
technique that works as well

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:90%
for women as works for men.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, so we
get the oxytocin

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.133 align:middle line:90%
and those great hormones.

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: You get the female
hormones and the male hormones.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.008 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
what we want is

00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
to get into the flow, where
your genius comes forth,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.542 align:middle line:84%
and it's a effortless
flow of meditation.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
experience that today,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:90%
with this technique.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is great.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.645 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And it was never
taught in the past.

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it
wasn't taught--

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
it was known in
the secret masters.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.588 align:middle line:84%
And I have studied in
Tibet, with masters,

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've learned some of this
from them and adopted it.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.228 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I ask you how
did you meet the Maharishi?

00:05:50.228 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: How did I
meet the Maharishi?

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Uh, let me go back.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.422 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: OK.

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
introductory lecture.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I learned transcendental
meditation.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And then that year,
Maharishi came to America

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
for the first time,
for a big course.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.783 align:middle line:90%
It was in Poland Springs, Maine.

00:06:04.783 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
There were 1,000
people, 1,000 hippies.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We all went up there for
a month to hear lectures

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
from him all day long.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first lecture,
I was kind of late.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I got there, and I'm sitting
in the back of 1,000 people,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.303 align:middle line:84%
and I said, this is not
going to happen again.

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:90%
But I was just a little kid.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.012 align:middle line:84%
I was like the
youngest person there,

00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
like 17 years old with all
these grown-up 20-year-olds

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.372 align:middle line:84%
And so I vowed I was never
going to sit in the back again.

00:06:28.372 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't let me
sit up front because I

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.288 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in the in crowd.

00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:32.872 align:middle line:84%
There was this whole
section of people

00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
who'd been with him in
India and various things.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
So I pointed myself.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I got up
really early went there.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.277 align:middle line:84%
And I started pretending
like I was the usher--

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and who could go up
front and who could not.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.693 align:middle line:84%
And I had a usher's seat, and I
would sit in the usher's seat.

00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:90%
So I'd be right in the front.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And then so I got to hang
around him a lot that way,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
appointing myself as the usher.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Then what would happen is
that he went to West Coast

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:90%
to do a course.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And nobody from the
East Coast could

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:90%
go because it was sold out--

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
1,000 people at
Humboldt University.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Big hippie thing--
Maharishi was there.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Great lectures-- all excitement
in the new hippie age.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And I just didn't listen to him.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't let me in.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I just went.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I hitchhiked across the country.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I hitchhiked over there--
had hardly any money.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And this was really funny.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get in.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't register me.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
You're not allowed.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.188 align:middle line:90%
You were at the other course.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.077 align:middle line:90%
So I was little.

00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So the Maharishi would
come in the back door

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
with his entourage of rich
and famous and VIP people.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
And he'd come by.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.383 align:middle line:84%
I'd sneak in and go
right up behind him

00:07:28.383 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
because he was a little guy.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.008 align:middle line:84%
And I'd stand right behind him
and walk through every time,

00:07:32.008 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
pretending like I
was one of the VIPs.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I did this every
day for a month.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:90%
So then he did his--

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
he did his only teacher
training program in America.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a three-month
in-residence course here

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:90%
at Estes Park, in Colorado.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So again,
I applied for that.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.327 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't accept
me because I was too young.

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
You had to be in your
20s, and I was 17 or 18.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And so I went anyway.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I said but I'm here.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you
can't become a teacher.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I said you'll see.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically would
share and shine, show up,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.328 align:middle line:90%
and share my experiences.

00:08:05.328 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
said I couldn't.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.787 align:middle line:84%
And I went to him, and
I said I want to do it.

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And he said OK.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.115 align:middle line:90%
And it was always me pushing.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I always pushed.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.555 align:middle line:90%
And then he knew me.

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You had goals though.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.223 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I had goals.

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I had motivation.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I was just like I'm
going to get in there.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I just leaned in.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up taking
every course he ever

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
taught to the public, during
the next three or four years.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he only gave
talks to his people,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and I started teaching
those courses as well,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
as teacher training programs.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But during that time, we'd have
these rounding courses where

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:90%
you'd meditate six hours a day.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.109 align:middle line:90%
You'd meditate awhile.

00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:90%
Do some yoga.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:36.472 align:middle line:90%
Then meditate awhile.

00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Do some yoga.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Guided meditation?

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: No, you'd
be in your rooms,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:90%
all separately, doing this.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.705 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Called it rounding.

00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
You'd do breathing exercise.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:84%
First you'd do yoga postures,
then breathing exercise, then

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
meditate 30 minutes.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.417 align:middle line:84%
Then yoga postures,
breathing exercise, and then

00:08:50.417 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:90%
meditate 30 minutes.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Those are the rounds?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And you do rounding,
maybe five, six rounds a day.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, after a while, I
started doing way more.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And I started sharing a lot.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And I had stellar experiences.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to be
his personal assistant.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
His personal assistant got
sick, and his other assistant

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:90%
go and got sick.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And the other one got
kicked out for bad behavior.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
So we had no assistants.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.905 align:middle line:90%
So there were nine VIP guys.

00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
These were all rich people.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.893 align:middle line:84%
Because he had people around him
who could afford it and travel

00:09:17.893 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
with him and all this.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.827 align:middle line:90%
But so then nine were there.

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, they were
all waiting in line

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to be picked as the
new personal assistant.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So I went and sat in the line.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said no, you can't
be here-- you're not a VIP.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So I was like really depressed.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I went to my room.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.305 align:middle line:90%
I cried.

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I just
happened to get up early.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'll
just get up before them.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I went up, and I went
and sat in the chair,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:90%
waiting for them to come up.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And what Maharishi
would say to people--

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
which is when he
was ready, he had

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.275 align:middle line:84%
people go away because everybody
wanted to be around him.

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:90%
He'd say, good to go and rest.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Good to go and rest.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting
there in the morning,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.448 align:middle line:90%
and the next VIP guy came up.

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what
are you doing here?

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm the new assistant.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.063 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what do you mean?

00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I'm
the new assistant,

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's good to go and rest.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And so everybody
who came in, I said it's

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:90%
good to go and rest.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
It's good to go and rest.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't lie.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.492 align:middle line:84%
I just said it's
good to go and rest.

00:10:08.492 --> 00:10:10.427 align:middle line:84%
I kicked everybody off
the floor for two days.

00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So Maharishi was forced
to push his little button,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.688 align:middle line:84%
and I would come in, and I would
come in to take over the job.

00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:18.355 align:middle line:84%
So I never wanted to ask because
I was afraid of being rejected.

00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:19.893 align:middle line:90%
You're too young.

00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] So anyway--

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.947 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just had a will.

00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I just had a will.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he went on a trip, a
tour of America, at that time.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I had hardly any money.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I had $150.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, there
was a tour from Europe,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.445 align:middle line:90%
around America, for $121.

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I spent almost
all of my money

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:84%
on this ticket, Tour America,
for $120, around in a circle.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: As long as you're in a
circle, going back to Europe,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:90%
things were cheap then.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And he was
touring America.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.157 align:middle line:90%
So I bought the ticket.

00:10:45.157 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting here
as his assistant,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and people are saying,
oh, Maharishi I'd

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:90%
like to come with you.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:90%
He'd say best to stay.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Best to stay.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to travel
with all these people.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a headache.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so nobody was
there to travel with them.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I had asked, he
would have said best

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
to stay because he had
people on the other end that

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.644 align:middle line:90%
would take care of him.

00:11:00.644 --> 00:11:01.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You knew not to ask.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: So I didn't ask.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.853 align:middle line:90%
I just bought the ticket.

00:11:03.853 --> 00:11:05.395 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So we
got on the airplane.

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:06.936 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting next to
him on the plane.

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:90%
He just laughed at me.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
He just said this
kid has got this far.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He recognized you.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: He probably
saw himself in me

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.855 align:middle line:84%
because he was his guru's
personal assistant and so,

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:16.655 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wonderful.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.587 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Anyway, so I went to
that and persisted with him.

00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:90%
We were so sweet together.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.385 align:middle line:90%
He was like a father to me.

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And also when he would
teach his meditation courses

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.315 align:middle line:84%
on these rounding
courses, I just

00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
happened to be
really good at it.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very dedicated to it.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
stories about that.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The stories,
I'm sure, could go on--

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Just go on and
on and on about it.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --forever.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But I learned,
really, through meditation,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
how to have altered
higher consciousness.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I probably would've still
been there, but at nine years,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I had brought-- my
brother was bipolar.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.585 align:middle line:84%
And a meditation-- I
brought him to Switzerland,

00:11:53.585 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:90%
where we were at that time.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.065 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't help him.

00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just
gotta go back, John.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, OK.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt my
brother's suffering.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And here I am, in the glory
of my life, and you know--

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had already
written your books and--

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No, no.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
No books-- this is
all just meditation.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.278 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the posters with him.

00:12:09.278 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had my brain--
they had this flying thing,

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
where you're hopping around, and
they have my picture doing it.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And my brain chemical,
my brainwaves

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
as a display in 3,600 cities.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, Maharishi's
picture, then here I am.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was a well-known person in
the TM movement at that time.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Wow, very fortunate.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Or, as you could say, destiny.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It definitely destiny.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:90%
This was destiny.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And actually, my
last conversation with him, I

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
was asking about what
my future would be.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says in 10
years, you will own

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
this movement is what he said.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
But that was my last
conversation with him

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
because my brother was sick.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't be in
this glorious place

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
when my brother's sick and
meditation didn't help.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So I felt in my heart I just had
to go find an answer for him.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.265 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And I flew out to
California to study psychology,

00:12:58.265 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
thinking that could
help my brother.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And trying to help my brother
launched my whole career

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
because studying
psychology, I then started

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.898 align:middle line:84%
having a counseling practice
and realized that there's

00:13:08.898 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
a better way to counsel people.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was by understanding
where people come

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:90%
from without right or wrong.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.756 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The differences
without judgement.

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:16.464 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, the
differences came forth.

00:13:16.464 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And meditation gave me
the ability to be curious,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
rather than to
immediately judge,

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and to study, rather
than to give advice.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To observe.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: To observe
and feel empathy.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And it prepared me for that.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I could be this great
counselor and great husband

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and father of my children.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is a
foundation where you

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.902 align:middle line:90%
can find unconditional love.

00:13:36.902 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're not full
within yourself,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
you're always looking
to be filled up.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.533 align:middle line:84%
And if you're looking
to be filled up,

00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:43.562 align:middle line:84%
you look to control
when you're empty.

00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you give up
control, and you

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
have this openness when you're
already fulfilled inside.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what meditation
can give people.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It also has
probably helped you

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You've had several very close

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Oh, devastating.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have this charmed
life, but at the same time,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I have these big devastations.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I could go on, but
just very shortly,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
my little brother, Jimmy, who
I actually came to America

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.737 align:middle line:90%
to help--

00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't help him, and he
ended up committing suicide.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So that was a
really hard thing on me.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And then there was my father.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
On my honeymoon with
Bonnie, my wife,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
got a call that he'd been found
dead in the trunk of his car.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
He had picked up a hitchhiker
and ended up dead in his car

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%
by the side of the road.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And here's the
irony of the magic of life.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
My last conversation-- I had
brought Bonnie to meet my dad,

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and he gives her a tour
of Houston, where I lived.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said to my dad--

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, now, dad, I
want to give you advice.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.433 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm grown up, and
I can give you advice.

00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
what's that John?

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's not safe
to pick up hitchhikers.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
He was a very generous man.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The tour we were on was of
the poor section of Houston,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.865 align:middle line:84%
where he had started the
clubs teaching them sports.

00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
He bought all the sports
equipment and the baseball

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.323 align:middle line:90%
equipment, and started all that.

00:15:05.323 --> 00:15:07.365 align:middle line:84%
So this is what he was so
proud of because he was

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
helping all these poor people.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
I say, but, dad,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:90%
you can't pick up hitchhikers.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, John, some
men, when they retire,

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:90%
they go on safari.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:90%
For me, I pick up hitchhikers.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: He would help people.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Give them money.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.227 align:middle line:90%
Drive them places.

00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And then a week later, I'm
on the honeymoon with Bonnie.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I hear the call,
and he's found.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big
turning point for me.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at my
tragedies, they always

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:90%

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:90%
You found a gift in that.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Found the gift in that.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I found the gift in Jimmy
because that helped open me up

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to the whole thing
of psychology.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And my whole destiny
came through that act

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to help him.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
My dad-- I got into the trunk.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
My family's all standing
around, but I just

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
felt like I had to relive
what he went through.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.077 align:middle line:84%
It was terrifying, the thought
of being left in a trunk.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Because he wasn't damaged.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:90%
He was just put in the trunk.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just wanted
to know, didn't you?

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.592 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I wanted to know.

00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to connect with my dad.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I saw where he had
taken a screwdriver

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and banged for help,
asking for help.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And three times, people
called the police,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and the police didn't come.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's the
lack of communication.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.743 align:middle line:84%
Until my mother called,
the fourth call,

00:16:10.743 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and they said, yeah,
that car's been reported.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
We'll go check it out.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Because he wasn't killed.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
He died in the trunk
from heat asphyxiation.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But he was crying
out, making noises.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing he did is
he unscrewed the back light.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And so you pull it in.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a Mercedes.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Back then, they didn't have
a release to open the trunk.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:90%
So he was trapped.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm in the
trunk, I pull this back,

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and just without thinking,
I put my hand out.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm pulling my
hand back, my brother

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of
the trunk says,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
John, see if you can reach
around to the button.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And I reached around, pushed the
button, and opened the trunk.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's a tragedy.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That easy.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.905 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: That's the tragedy of it
is that the solution was there,

00:16:51.905 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
but he just didn't
think about it

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
because when you're in the box,
you're only trying to get out.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking from
the other point of view.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
such a huge lesson.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It was a
huge lesson for me.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the birth
of "Men Are from Mars,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.817 align:middle line:84%
Women Are from Venus" is that
whenever there's a problem,

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
look at it from the other
person's point of view.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.537 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: We should always
know that when there's

00:17:10.537 --> 00:17:12.974 align:middle line:84%
a miscommunication, we're
looking at our point of view

00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to trying to look at
it from the other point of view

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:90%
and blend them together.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was an inspiration
for me in my life.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we
can thank your dad.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah, thank my dad.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's always with
me because of that.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Then, my sister--

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
younger sister-- died
of early Alzheimer's.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So that was awful.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Awful what they--
they drug them up, and they

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.665 align:middle line:84%
put them in these
hospitals to collect money.

00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And it just-- it was horrible.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Then there's my mother.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:90%
She died of an accident.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
She had asked them to come and
repair the heater at her house

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
because it was
putting off gassing.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't come, and
then she died from poison.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Carbon monoxide.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.207 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Carbon
monoxide poisoning.

00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these are not
old-age-related deaths.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:90%
These are tragedies.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:56.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: These are traumas.

00:17:56.645 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, these are tragedies.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.582 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Each one of them.

00:17:58.582 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is amazing that you
are able to sit and really

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:90%
teach about love.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, well, I think
here's a thought for everyone

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we all come into this
world with destinies, but we--

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
it's like trying to fly
from LA to New York.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
A plane is actually
never on track.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.845 align:middle line:90%
It's always deviating.

00:18:17.845 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It's self-correcting.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The wind blows it this way--
the computer self corrects.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's never really
going straight.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.108 align:middle line:84%
So our life, to be in
tune, tune into our flow,

00:18:27.108 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
we're always going
to be off balance.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.805 align:middle line:84%
And it's only by being off
balance and coming back

00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
into balance that we
can find the flow again.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that the truth.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.103 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Because no one's
ever going to be perfect.

00:18:36.103 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So mistakes and
tragedies and losses--

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
they all help us to
come back to more,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:90%
even when we make mistakes.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Because when my brother
committed suicide,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt so much
guilt for not being

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
able to help him and be a better
brother when I was growing up.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Not like I was a bad brother,
but you just look at everything

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
you wish you could
have done differently.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.485 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
talk about that

00:18:53.485 --> 00:18:57.175 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody finds the
reason in the death of a loved

00:18:57.175 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:90%
one, like you have.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, and so what I
looked at is I felt my guilt,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.887 align:middle line:84%
and I used that to
become a better person.

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
See, that's what
guilt can do for you.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
When you feel the guilt,
you let it go because you're

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:90%
going to learn from it.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Everybody makes
mistakes, but you

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:84%
grow if you take on
your guilt, and you let

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:90%
it go with self forgiveness.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And that helps us to adjust.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Our heart opens and says
I want to be better.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I want to be better.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And with Jimmy,
that was my pledge.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I look back on his
childhood, and I saw

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:90%
how he always looked up to me.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was this little guy.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:90%
But who looked up to him?

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So I was always sort
of thinking about me

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't always
pumping him up.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So I said to myself
when he died,

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the places looking,
is I pledge to myself,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.865 align:middle line:84%
when somebody is there
for me, I'm always

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:90%
going to be there for them.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I won't forget them.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big thing for me.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Then--

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A beautiful way to
live your life, by the way.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Be grateful.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I wrote
my first book--

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
before "Men Are from Mars" was
"Men, Women and Relationships."

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
And no publisher wanted me.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of
mine had a friend

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.467 align:middle line:90%
with a small distribution house.

00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And they took that
book, and they sold

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.993 align:middle line:90%
50,000 copies, which is huge.

00:20:09.993 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, how
did they do it?

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, an agent found
me and sent-- because no agent

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:90%
wanted me at the time.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't any famous
person or whatever.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.925 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I can sell
your book to New York.

00:20:19.925 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And Bonnie and I
were so excited.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
This book, "Men, Women
and Relationships"--

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:90%
New York's going to buy.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
In those days, New
York was everything.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.915 align:middle line:84%
If you have a New
York publisher,

00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:90%
you just didn't get in stores.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're so excited, and I
called up the publishers.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Group West is what
they were called.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, good news--

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:90%
New York's going to buy my book.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.295 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes, good
news for you, but not for us.

00:20:39.295 --> 00:20:40.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:42.762 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Because they said, every
time we have a successful book,

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:90%
they take it away.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't get to build it.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And he says, will you at
least let us talk to you

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.815 align:middle line:84%
and show you that
we think we can

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:90%
do a great job with your book.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:90%
I said yes.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
And I had to at least do that.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Everybody I talked
to said, this is your dream.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Go with New York.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.085 align:middle line:90%
This is your dream.

00:20:56.085 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
My agent-- they're
ready to buy your book.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you had these
people that started with you.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.562 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: So I go to the meeting.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.312 align:middle line:84%
And there I am in the
meeting, and they're

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:04.632 align:middle line:90%
telling me what they can do.

00:21:04.632 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
not as much as what

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
New York could do for my book.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But then the president
of the company was there.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, so will you
trust us and let us do it?

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And when he did it, it was
the voice of my brother Jimmy.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I felt the spirit of
Jimmy right there.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
people who had helped me

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:90%
when nobody else would.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And so I was not
about to take this book away

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.853 align:middle line:84%
So he said, will you
give us the book?

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And my wife was shocked.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:90%
My agent was shocked.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.785 align:middle line:84%
Because my heart
was open-- pure.

00:21:31.785 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That was the spirit
talking through me.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:90%
This is my lesson.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.953 align:middle line:90%
And Jimmy was there.

00:21:36.953 --> 00:21:38.745 align:middle line:84%
So I remember then
getting in the elevator,

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and my agent said to me,
what are you going to do?

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:90%
You know we can sell that book.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'll
write another one.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:90%
You can write another one?

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, I can write it better.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And in three months,
I had finished it.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Every day, I worked--

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:90%
I took my kids to school.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I babysitted Lauren.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.612 align:middle line:90%
I wrote for six hours.

00:21:58.612 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Every week, wrote a chapter--

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:90%
12 chapters.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It was done.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the easiest
book I've ever

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
written because it came
right from that place

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in my heart, which is
do the right thing,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and the universe supports you.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
was "Mars, Venus."

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And that's "Men Are from
Mars, Women Are from Venus."

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.253 align:middle line:90%
So what a beautiful thing.

00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's growing
from learning a lesson

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
from something and
letting your heart grow

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:84%
through these mishaps to
help us become better.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you were
operating your life

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:90%
not from a place of survival.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And these years of
meditation and learning

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
how to work with the
universe and the higher good

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.595 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, I think
would have contributed

00:22:33.595 --> 00:22:34.845 align:middle line:90%
to making decisions like that.

00:22:34.845 --> 00:22:36.762 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, well,
everything-- you see, we all

00:22:36.762 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
have the prefrontal
cortex, the monkey brain,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and the instinctive brain.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
All of our emotional, negative
emotions, fears, doubts,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
angers, frustrations,
hesitate-- that's all monkey

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:90%
brain talking.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn
through meditation

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the
prefrontal cortex,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
then you connect to the big
boss, which is your spirit.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And spirit-- even
now, as my wife has passed--

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and she died of cancer.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:00.825 align:middle line:90%
And it was tragic.

00:23:00.825 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just so beautiful, and then
suddenly, within a few months,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
it was gone.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:90%

But such a tragedy, and
I'm grieving even now.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through months and
months of the grieving process.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rightfully so.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: There's still always
this little star up there

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:84%
in my higher self that says
you're going to get through it.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.728 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be OK.

00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
You're going to grow from this.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be a
better man from this.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I already
am a better person

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.145 align:middle line:84%
from growing because your
mind goes back, and it says,

00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:90%
oh, I wish I had done this.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had done that.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.475 align:middle line:84%
That's what guilt
can do-- reflection.

00:23:29.475 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Those are the lessons.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: As long
as you can let it

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:84%
go is realizing you have to
come from the unconditional love

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.482 align:middle line:84%
for yourself and others,
which meditation can give you.

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Because through
meditation, you can

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:90%
connect with the life stream.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.377 align:middle line:90%
You connect with the spirit.

00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the spirit world,
there's no good, no bads.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
It's all unconditional.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So through these
techniques and this experience,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
for nine years of meditation
and really working

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
with these tools, you can take
your experience with Bonnie

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I did that, and
maybe I feel badly about that,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:90%
but I'll do better next time.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And you don't give
yourself judgment or shame

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.808 align:middle line:90%
or get stuck in that place.

00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It's not getting stuck.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:90%
I feel guilty.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I should have done this.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I should have-- basically,
I should have saved her.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the emotional side of it.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I failed her.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:90%
I saved her.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the end, she
said, John, you're my hero.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
You did everything.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It was so sweet.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But what you have to do
is feelings have to come forth.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:90%
The feelings come forth.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you have meditation, you
observe them, and they flow.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And as feelings, or dirty
feelings or negative feelings--

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:90%
they just flow and become pure.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They clean themselves
if you can feel it,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and you learn to let go.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Meditation helps you
to let go and let

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:90%
yourself get into the flow.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I saw in
my own experience

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
of being a meditator--

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could I ask you really
quick about the grief process?

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:90%

And through the
grieving process,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
you are letting
the feelings come,

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and then allowing them

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:90%
You're still working.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
You're still doing your

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the recognition that I only
miss her because I love her.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I only feel guilty
because I love her.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And what heals the heart
is coming back to feeling

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%

I'm doing for myself now.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.492 align:middle line:90%
So it will bring up grief.

00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it will bring
up the love of gratitude

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.825 align:middle line:90%
that she did that for me.

00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Just the other day,
the most recent one

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
was I was rushing home from the
airport, and I asked myself,

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:90%
why am I rushing?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.225 align:middle line:84%
And I'm rushing to
get home to see her.

00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It was just like--
and she's not there.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, it brings
up the feelings.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And I'll be
doing my laundry,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and she used to do my laundry.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing the laundry, and
in the beginning, it was like,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:90%
she did this for me.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even thank her for it.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
It would be such
sweetness when you see all

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:90%
the things your partner does.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.305 align:middle line:84%
And now, part of
the healing process

00:26:04.305 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
is when I'm doing my
laundry, she's inside of me.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm folding my T-shirts
the way she did,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm feeling
the comfort of her

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
still, remembering the love.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what a great
lesson to those of us who do

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
take our relationships
for granted.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to really be
grateful for that moment.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, and
to me, I just--

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.067 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For all of the moments.

00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: I miss so much that
first thing in the morning--

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:90%
she was a morning person.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.065 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me neither.

00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: I need to
meditate awhile.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But every morning, I'd
get up, and she would

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
be in her little nightgown.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.645 align:middle line:84%
And she'd greet me a big
smile and her blue eyes.

00:26:39.645 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just said
good morning, honey.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like she had no
problem in the world.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.417 align:middle line:84%
She could come from that
pure feminine energy.

00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:47.333 align:middle line:84%
Problems would come later
with her, [CHUCKLES]

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:90%
but she would start fresh.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:90%
And what a gift that was to me.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Because all
any man ever wants

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.763 align:middle line:90%
is to see his partner happy.

00:26:53.763 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And every woman wants
her husband to be happy.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.235 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So just to know
that that hug was such a--

00:26:59.235 --> 00:27:00.327 align:middle line:90%
would just anchor.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so every day, I wake up and
I imagine giving her that hug.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you feel
these feelings of grief,

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.685 align:middle line:84%
and you go through this,
but yet, at the same time,

00:27:06.685 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:84%
you have this base, this
strong base that you've learned

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:90%
through decades of meditation.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it gives you the anchor
to come back to what is true.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.085 align:middle line:84%
See, part of the pain
of losing someone

00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is I'll never love again because
no one will ever replace her,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:90%
so I'll never love again.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:90%
I will love again.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So the inner-self
knows what is true.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like a light
that shines on it.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.038 align:middle line:84%
But you shine on the
little monkey brain,

00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:84%
going through all the
attachments and letting go.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:90%
It's painful to let go.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
The brain has to
reorganize itself,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
from I depend on you
for this, to depend

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.890 align:middle line:90%
on others for this or this.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a shift that takes
time, but many people never

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:90%
make the shift fully.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.388 align:middle line:84%
They just push everything
down, avoiding it.

00:27:47.388 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So you walk through
my house-- you'll

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.222 align:middle line:90%
see all the pictures are there.

00:27:50.222 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm still doing the
lighting the candle,

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.823 align:middle line:84%
putting the flowers in
front of her picture.

00:27:53.823 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I've got the computer
always showing pictures.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to see it and
feel it and let the feelings

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:90%
come up.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And they always come in a wave.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%
You just come back to love.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be open to all
kinds of feelings, not just

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:90%
sadness.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to get in
touch with fear,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
the fear of the insecurity.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, who will I find?

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Will I be loved again?

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They're deep, deep-seated
fears, insecurities

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
that often come from childhood.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the anger.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Anger is always there.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for me, I was so
angry with God, and angry--

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
all these song lyrics
started coming into me.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I want to turn back time.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to rip open the
fabric of time and go back.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I just want to go back.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.247 align:middle line:90%
Don't take her away from me.

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through the
sadness again and the fears.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes back to love.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, it all comes
back to love and gratitude.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is a big one--
the time I had with her

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and all that she's done for me.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of the
most unimaginable, which

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is the death of a
child, and there's

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:90%
no justification for any death.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No.

00:28:54.405 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

>>LISA: And all
that you're saying,

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
really, is going through
the fabric of all of it

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:90%
and coming back to love.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the anger.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the grief.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the denial.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.207 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the bargaining.

00:29:05.207 --> 00:29:06.165 align:middle line:90%
Yes, all the accepting.

00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:07.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And the
guilt. And the guilt.

00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the guilt.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And let it be whatever
your feelings are saying.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But if they're painful,
they're not true,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:90%
meaning they're not facts.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The way your soul communicates
to you that you're thinking

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
needs to be adjusted--
it's limited--

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is by giving you pain
for having that thought.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the pain I feel with
Bonnie is that I can't ever

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:90%
love her again.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I can never receive
her love again.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lie.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

>>GRAY: She's around

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I get to talk about her.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.764 align:middle line:90%
I get to remember her.

00:29:34.764 --> 00:29:36.001 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the memories
of her and all of that.

00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:37.709 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It's being
able to feel the love.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And also to the deep,
deep part of the self,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.627 align:middle line:84%
if I don't have her,
who will love me?

00:29:42.627 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, other people will love me.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.835 align:middle line:10%
But I have to eventually
make that adjustment

00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:10%
to experience other people
loving me so my mind can let

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:10%
go of just depending on her.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Because she's my soul mate.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody
like her in my life.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:90%
And no one ever will be.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But I will have people
to love and there'll be love,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:90%
but it won't be--

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you will be loved--

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: --what she gave.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think a sexual
relationship is so hard

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
because you connect so deeply
in sex, if you have great sex.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:90%
We had great sex.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:84%
To me, the moment of great sex
is when you're coming together,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and you feel so
100%, I am yours--

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:90%
you are mine.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Pure attachment-- you are mine.

We are together forever.

we're not together.

You know, that's
that whole truth.

there's a rip,
that's what causes

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the pain is the belief that
we'll never be together again.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
As one card said, it's
only a matter of time,

we keep our departed, or

close to us is through

And the more people

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:84%
it keeps their

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
resonance, the technique

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about is
how to-- explain this to us.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: OK, whenever-- and
so a few concepts first.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:84%
One is meditation has
been difficult for women

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes boring for
men because the techniques

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning often
were taught 2,000 years ago,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years ago.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different time.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.542 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: A different
time, when people

00:32:12.542 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't have access to spirit.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I have worked
with, in Tibet and in India,

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
various masters,
called miracle workers,

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- they have a
secret knowledge that

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:90%
wasn't taught to the public.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it wasn't
taught to the public

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
is because people
couldn't do it.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like teaching
geometry or algebra to someone

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:90%
who needs to learn addition.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And what they all do is
they learn the access points

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the divine energy,
to transmute it, to send it,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to do all kinds of things with
it, is through the fingertips.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see when
Jesus, for example,

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed as doing healing,
he'll bless people like this.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So what is going on
with his fingers?

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, this pulls energy down.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
This pulls Mother
Earth energy up.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Bring those two worlds together,
and you project the energy

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
through the thumb.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they're doing.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.200 align:middle line:90%
But they don't teach that.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they teach it?

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Because people couldn't feel it.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're having
dinner the other night.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.877 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is
just put my hand up.

00:33:08.877 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Put your hand out.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:90%
And start, all the sudden--

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.100 align:middle line:84%
anybody watching, if you just
put your hand up in the air

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Just think about fingertips.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
divine spirit come,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth come
up from the earth,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.375 align:middle line:84%
and you start to feel
energy in your fingers.

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's an enormous
amount of heat that--

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Just starts
getting generated.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.207 align:middle line:84%
We have this
ability, like there's

00:33:30.207 --> 00:33:31.665 align:middle line:84%
all this money in
our bank account,

00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know
we had checks for it.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And where it came from is the
same thing in all my books

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
on relationship.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:84%
How relationships
have changed is now,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.210 align:middle line:84%
both because we
have more connection

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
with the divine,
higher consciousness,

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
more connectivity, we are
free to go to our female side

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:90%
or our male side.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because spirit is
both male and female.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Physical body is male.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.572 align:middle line:84%
Physical body for
a woman is female.

00:33:55.572 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But on the physical plane,
we have these differences.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But on the spiritual plane,
both energies are available.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So this meditation is one
which is for men and women

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.708 align:middle line:84%
because accesses both
your male and female side.

00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It makes sense
because as you said,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
the public wasn't taught this
several thousand years ago

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because of the density of
the population at the time,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:84%
so close to survival and
so newly out of survival.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we are more of
an evolved species,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:90%
several thousand years later.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.675 align:middle line:84%
And we have the freedom to
connect with the divine.

00:34:27.675 --> 00:34:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And we have
the freedom to have

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.945 align:middle line:84%
both feminine and
masculine at the same time.

00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:90%
That's the ecstasy.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the flow.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the genius.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the Dao.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.718 align:middle line:84%
It's when you have both
masculine and feminine,

00:34:39.718 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:90%
united together.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:90%
And in sex, that's an orgasm.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.385 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunately
temporary for people.

00:34:44.385 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's also inclusion.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:90%
That's inclusion.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, it's
completely oneness there.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So this meditation is you
become aware of your fingertips.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing, just
to be aware of your fingertips.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And then you set your intention.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to give
you the phrase that I use.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can make your own, but
I've used it over and over.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Many people-- it seems
to be really helpful.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have a word
for higher power.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
use divine spirit.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if you
say God, some people

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:90%
have buttons that get pushed.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But Divine Spirit,
most people can handle.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And another word that most
people can handle is angels.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.313 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Angels are the
messengers of Heaven,

00:35:23.313 --> 00:35:26.610 align:middle line:84%
the energy flows, the vortexes
that come in and whatever.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:90%
But they're poetic.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
say Divine Spirit,

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.102 align:middle line:90%
we open our hearts to you.

00:35:32.102 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's an intention.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Divine spirit, we
open our hearts.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:84%
That means we're going
to feel your presence.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
meditation, you're

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
going to feel the energy in your
fingertips, then your palms,

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and it may go in other
parts of your body.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But see, if you're
feeling, you're flowing.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
flowing, you're focused.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're doing the yang
energy is focus, concentration.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.165 align:middle line:90%
But you're effortlessly flowing.

00:35:54.165 --> 00:35:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're bringing the male
and the female together.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, in "Yoga Sutras," that's
called Darrena and Dion.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
When you can do both
at the same time,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.187 align:middle line:84%
advanced meditators
think I went to somatic,

00:36:05.187 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
everybody's thought,

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:90%
one day I'll have somatic.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.245 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to
have somatic right now.

00:36:10.245 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this so easily.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we have access to
our male and female side,

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:90%
we can do both at the same time.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And beautifully,
when you do this,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.607 align:middle line:84%
it also helps you balance
your own energies in life.

00:36:20.607 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Because women are often,
when they're overwhelmed,

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%
they're on their male side.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:84%
When men are passive,
are irritable,

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
grumpy, they're too far
on their emotional side.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
giving your energy away.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.343 align:middle line:84%
This gives you and
restores your energy.

00:36:31.343 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: This
restores the balance.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And so how to
restore the balance--

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.240 align:middle line:84%
so there's a
phenomena in nature.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:90%
One is fingertips.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the turn-on
switch because, see,

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:90%
think about how do I touch you.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.048 align:middle line:90%
Fingertips.

00:36:43.048 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So if you want to touch, feel--

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm, anything.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: --spirit--
it's fingertips

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:90%
is the turn-on switch.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.857 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
learn to do your toes,

00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and then your whole
body can resonate.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But the fingertips is
the turn-on switch.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
So I just go fingertips-- boom.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:90%
The energies are flowing.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So we know in acupuncture,
there are these energy

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.445 align:middle line:90%
channels in the body.

00:37:01.445 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And when people
are sick, there's

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
always a block in those
energies somewhere.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is
they put a needle in

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.260 align:middle line:84%
to cause painful
sensation because when

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.565 align:middle line:84%
you have painful sensation,
energy flows there.

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.093 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And breaks up the block.

00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And energy flows
and breaks the block.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So in acupuncture, they press
a point where you feel pain.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
When you feel pain,
energy is released.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the energy
being released.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So like yelling and
screaming-- people feel better,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
but they don't end
up healing anything.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They just release
the blocked energy.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a lot of sugar,
you release the energy.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.675 align:middle line:84%
When you take
drugs, you release.

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
People feel uncomfortable--
they go and eat a desert,

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:90%
or they go and they take drugs.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.332 align:middle line:84%
Or they do things to lose their
energy because it's blocked.

00:37:42.332 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's too stuck.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: That's what tension
is is energy gets blocked.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And what is that energy?

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It's divine energy
that becomes blocked.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's, on the
surface, it's tension.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you go a little deeper,
it's negative emotions.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
All negative emotions are
divine energy, love energy,

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.700 align:middle line:84%
positive desire, soul
desire, good desire to serve,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to be of love, to
love and be loved.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That energy's flowing, and
it's something we do to stop.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It gets stuck.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It gets stuck.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gotcha.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So as soon as there's
a block, and energy's flowing,

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
now that tension builds, and
that's a negative emotion.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So part of this technique--

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sorry, that
makes perfect sense.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're going in a direction
with a passion or something

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that you really thought
was going to work out,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and it all of a sudden
gets stuck or jolted

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
or ripped away
from you, it does--

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:90%
it sticks the energy.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It freezes it right where it
was in the motion of love.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.885 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So in the Daoist
philosophy in China,

00:38:33.885 --> 00:38:36.840 align:middle line:84%
they call that blocked energy,
stuck energy, stale energy.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
In therapy, we have people
talk about their emotions,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and they feel better.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's because if you can express
emotion, and something else--

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.560 align:middle line:84%
if somebody else can feel it
with you so you're not alone

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:90%
in it--

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.830 align:middle line:90%
a bigger healing happens.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Just being in touch
with your feelings

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.340 align:middle line:90%
is good to let them go.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But if there's somebody
listening to you,

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.745 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to let it go
because there's a permission.

00:38:57.745 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Permission.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: There's an empathy.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Connection.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: There's a love
that says I understand.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So understanding
and empathy help release it.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So in this meditation, we're
going to use our fingertips.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
call in the spirit.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.025 align:middle line:84%
Now, the spirit is
always here, right?

00:39:11.025 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to bring
our awareness to it.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
It's stating, out
loud, our intention.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So what phrase--
it's very simple.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.240 align:middle line:84%
It's Divine Spirit, my
heart is open to you.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
If we're doing it
together, it would

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:90%
be our hearts are open to you.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:28.076 align:middle line:84%
Come-- now when you say come,
you feel it right there.

00:39:28.076 --> 00:39:28.876 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I do.

00:39:28.876 --> 00:39:29.876 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It's just there.

00:39:29.876 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's just Divine Spirit,
our hearts are open to you.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It could also be, if you
want, I open my heart to you.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.362 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:39:36.362 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
if you just have

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the tension on your fingertips,
you get goose bumps.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It just suddenly--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:41.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:39:41.415 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:90%

1, 2, 3.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Next step, I need your help.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:90%

The angels are there.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:90%
The universe is there.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And rarely
do we ask for it.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And we
don't ask for help.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.202 align:middle line:84%
Because it's good to do--
you know, a child needs help.

00:40:00.202 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, you
want to do it yourself.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So the universe says,
OK, develop yourself,

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:84%
but when you need
help, I'm here.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So it will come to help us

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's the idea is
co-creating with nature.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

So today, the help we need, you

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:90%
The energy will do it.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
It will flow just like your arm.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:84%
If I say to my arm,
up, it will do this.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:84%
If I cannot feel the
arm, it won't respond.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel the
energy of the universe,

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.670 align:middle line:84%
the intelligent energy
of the universe,

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:84%

Heal my body.

If you're emotionally
stuck or negativity,

Heal my spirit.

And my spirit crashed.

That means they're in

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what you're
talking about, but we love it.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And right in that moment, that
was such a key moment for me

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because I realized, oh, this
isn't where I'm supposed to be.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Because I was making
my suffering kind of noble,

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that I was helping
all these people.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
important awareness for me

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to realize you can't
help everybody.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You have to find what
you're here to do.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It took a while for
me to find that.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And that, you stick to that.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't solve all the
problems in the world.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
You stick to what
you're here to do.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.300 align:middle line:84%
If I did everything, nobody
else would have anything to do.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.814 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you found that
through that deep, dark night

00:46:16.814 --> 00:46:17.066 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:18.845 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, again, I was in the
dark night of the soul there.

00:46:18.845 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, it was
such a scary thing.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, when did you
develop this meditation

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:22.880 align:middle line:90%
technique?

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: OK, so then, after
being married to Bonnie

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and learning about "Mars,
Venus" and developing

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.460 align:middle line:84%
our masculine-feminine
energies, I

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:84%
realized that people are
having trouble with meditation

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're more advanced
than the techniques they're

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So these techniques
started coming to me

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.900 align:middle line:84%
through the energies
that speak to me,

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
simplify it, and simplify it

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.550 align:middle line:90%
so that anybody could do it.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.822 align:middle line:90%
And it's the concept.

00:46:48.822 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
See, we're very
logical people now.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:84%
People were not so
logical in the past.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So just use the concept,
the logic of, OK,

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.920 align:middle line:90%
there's this great power.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel you.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:58.910 align:middle line:90%
My heart is open.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Heart is open.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:00.007 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I welcome you.

00:47:00.007 --> 00:47:01.140 align:middle line:90%
My heart is open to you.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Come into my awareness.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I need you.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And then what I
learned from the masters

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:06.940 align:middle line:90%
was fingertips.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.032 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: They'd always just
be aware of your fingertips.

00:47:10.032 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Just, instantly, it comes.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is
it would amp up.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I would do these healings on
people who are really sick,

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and my heart would
feel bleed for them.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, Mother Mary, come.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And bang, she'd come
so strong when I need.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So I realized needing is
such an important part of it.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Then directing the energy--

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.120 align:middle line:84%
heal this person or
open the channels.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Heal me.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So heal my body is
a basic, simple one

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:84%
to open the channels so you can
feel this energy in your body.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:38.940 align:middle line:90%
So I need your help.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Heal my body.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So the next thing--

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:84%
this is why it's called
natural resonance meditation.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking the flowers.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that if
you were a Catholic,

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted a blessing
from Mother Mary, say,

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.370 align:middle line:84%
you would go to the thing,
and you would offer flowers.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: You would
offer a candle.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A light.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: A light.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.660 align:middle line:84%
You might offer some
gift-- whatever.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.760 align:middle line:90%
You give something.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, whenever
you give out of yourself,

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.480 align:middle line:90%
you have space to receive.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.860 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to receive.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to give something.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:09.735 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:48:09.735 --> 00:48:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.125 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Now, if
you're in India, they

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.803 align:middle line:84%
have what's called
[INAUDIBLE],, where

00:48:12.803 --> 00:48:14.340 align:middle line:84%
you would spend
eight hours where

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:90%
they're chanting into a fire.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.382 align:middle line:84%
Again, a natural frequency--
fire is a natural frequency.

00:48:20.382 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're throwing
things into it.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.170 align:middle line:84%
What that is is you're
calling forth the gods

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.108 align:middle line:90%
to hear your prayer.

00:48:27.108 --> 00:48:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you these offerings,
kind of like a business

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
transaction, but it's
all natural substances

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.330 align:middle line:90%
that you're giving.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a royalty,
you throw in gold.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.973 align:middle line:84%
It's anything that you're
attached to, give it up.

00:48:37.973 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It means more is
going to come in.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Creates more space.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: More space.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.523 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But you don't always
have to give up everything.

00:48:43.523 --> 00:48:46.670 align:middle line:84%
You just have to have your
heart open to feel the energy.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Then so it's like, heal my body.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Heal my body.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.577 align:middle line:84%
Use these flowers
to heal my body.

00:48:52.577 --> 00:48:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So just put your hands
over the flowers like that.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mm, roses have
such a beautiful frequency.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: They have a frequency.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.500 align:middle line:90%
They have a love frequency.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And love is so healing.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Particularly women
like the flowers.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:90%
You can do crystals.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.575 align:middle line:84%
Some people respond
better to crystals.

00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:05.422 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:49:05.422 --> 00:49:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Water is my favorite.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anything
that has a frequency.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah, everything has--

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything does.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Everything-- but
these are natural frequencies.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: See if the divine energy
isn't fully flowing through me,

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.470 align:middle line:84%
it's because some
part of me is blocked

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.110 align:middle line:90%
so it's not resonate with that.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
blocks, you awaken

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:22.770 align:middle line:90%
the energy, which we just did.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And then
we use the roses.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.880 align:middle line:90%
So just put our hands there.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And so you'd basically--

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Heal my body.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do you heal the body?

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Use these flowers.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm offering you these
flowers to heal my body.

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can feel my
fingertips tingling.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah they will tingle.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody watching, if
they just got some flowers

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
or have a fireplace, take
incense and throw it in.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Take this offering of incense.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Smudging, many
people know about.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It's offering the smoke.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or a crystal.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Crystals-- anything.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.443 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, does it pull the
energy away from the roses

00:49:54.443 --> 00:49:55.410 align:middle line:90%
so the roses will die?

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No, the roses love it.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.442 align:middle line:84%
First of all, all we're doing
right now is we're resonating.

00:49:59.442 --> 00:50:00.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the tingling
energy you get.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gotcha.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:01.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.977 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: First we
have to resonate.

00:50:02.977 --> 00:50:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you resonate,
what happens

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.870 align:middle line:84%
is the frequency in the rose,
because the heart is open,

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the divine energy's here-- we're
asking for it to do something.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.060 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to get into me?

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.650 align:middle line:84%
It's going to use
the rose frequency.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have to give it
a channel to come to us.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Now, if you went to
a healer, a gifted healer,

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.093 align:middle line:90%
they're the channel.

00:50:23.093 --> 00:50:25.740 align:middle line:84%
See, there, go into a state,
and their pure frequency--

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the energy will
flow through them.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:90%
But here's nature.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:90%
So always has it.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Water has it.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:90%
A view has it.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.093 align:middle line:90%
Music has it.

00:50:34.093 --> 00:50:35.510 align:middle line:84%
What's great about
this meditation

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:84%
is you sit down, put your
fingers up, and listen

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.880 align:middle line:90%
to music if it's holy mu--

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's spiritual,
inspiring music,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and just use this
music to heal my body.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if it is a
frequency that you don't know

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.310 align:middle line:90%
if it's a positive frequency.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.682 align:middle line:90%
So say something like money or--

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Don't do money.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely not money.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Just do natural.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, natural.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Your element--
your basic elements

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:57.915 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:50:57.915 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Elements.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: The moon you can do.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.417 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: We just
had the full moon.

00:51:01.417 --> 00:51:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing meditation.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The sun-- don't look at
the sun, but sit there,

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:84%
sunbathing with the sun,
and feel the sun's rays

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.560 align:middle line:90%
coming into you.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Natural energy.

00:51:09.518 --> 00:51:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Feel the earth energy
coming up into your hands.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.348 align:middle line:90%
You're resonating.

00:51:13.348 --> 00:51:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, for people that don't
fully understand resonance--

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I know many people do, but
not everybody really gets it.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're a piano tuner, you
have a little pipe over here,

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.960 align:middle line:84%
or a little machine
that bakes out a C note.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.610 align:middle line:90%
The strings on the piano--

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.190 align:middle line:84%
you turn them until they
get to that frequency,

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.633 align:middle line:84%
and they'll automatically
start making sound.

00:51:32.633 --> 00:51:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To the C note.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: To the C note.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.063 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So there's
no wire connecting.

00:51:36.063 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just this is
C. And suddenly,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.410 align:middle line:84%
what it will do is
when you've turned

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to tighten it to the point
where a C can be expressed,

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:90%
it comes up.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why if I'm loving
my wife, for example,

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and my heart is open to her,
it awakens my yin energy.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.855 align:middle line:84%
The female inside
of me comes forth.

00:51:54.855 --> 00:51:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You see, everybody wants
men to become more female.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.647 align:middle line:84%
But actually, men need to become
more masculine in their ability

00:51:59.647 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to open women up.

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
open a woman up,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.580 align:middle line:84%
your own female side comes up,
married to your own male side.

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not about becoming
female for men.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more masculine
to where you can embrace

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.920 align:middle line:90%
the feminine with respect.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.308 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And for women, when
they appreciate and love a man,

00:52:15.308 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
they're awaking their own
masculine power, which

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:84%
can be combined with their
female power as opposed

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.890 align:middle line:84%
to becoming masculine because
you can't depend on men.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:25.902 align:middle line:84%
Then you're disconnected
from the female.

00:52:25.902 --> 00:52:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's through love that we
can really find this wholeness

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.860 align:middle line:90%
in our relationships.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And this helps us to find
it through our meditation.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And I find almost everybody
can do this easily.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.028 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And it's so pleasing.

00:52:38.028 --> 00:52:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You suddenly feel this
energy and so then you--

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.700 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to come
back to the flow.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Divine Spirit, our
hearts are open to you.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Please come.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:90%
We need your help.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Heal our bodies.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Use these flowers
to heal our bodies.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And now you're feeling this kind
of a resonance with the flower.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of the flower
is shifting our frequency

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:90%
to that of the flower.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
is so automatic.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:05.830 align:middle line:84%
If somebody gets angry with
you, you get angry back.

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:06.630 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:90%
You just took on the frequency.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Matched their
frequency-- yes.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.595 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: If someone's afraid
of you, if they're defensive,

00:53:10.595 --> 00:53:12.000 align:middle line:90%
you get defensive towards them.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We are reflecting beings, so
put something in front of you

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that loves, that's
all pure love--

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.650 align:middle line:84%
love frequency, natural
elements, nature.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're resonating
natural resonance,

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:90%
setting the intention.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.132 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where it
gets really wonderful,

00:53:25.132 --> 00:53:26.472 align:middle line:90%
but I want everybody to feel it.

00:53:26.472 --> 00:53:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go through
the whole intention first,

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go
to the next level.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And this next level is the
awakening of the Kundalini.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.393 align:middle line:90%
This awakening the base chakra.

00:53:37.393 --> 00:53:39.060 align:middle line:84%
What we just did is
pull the energy down

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:90%
through all of our centers.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
down to the base.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.323 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we're also
pulling from the roses.

00:53:44.323 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Right now
we're just resonating.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, resonating.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Resonating--
and we're going

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to start waking up the
energy inside of us

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:51.487 align:middle line:90%
through resonating with this.

00:53:51.487 --> 00:53:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You're pulling because
we did some practice.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to pull.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.807 align:middle line:84%
But first, you want
to just resonate.

00:53:55.807 --> 00:53:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And we're just resonating.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It'll sometimes
feel like pulling.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.652 align:middle line:90%
So now what's happening.

00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Great Spirit, our
hearts are open to you.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Please come.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Heal our body.

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Open the channels for Lisa
and everybody watching.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Use these flowers to
activate the channels

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in everyone's body.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And then this is the next step.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Using these flowers, send your
healing angels to bless us.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Send your healing angels to

using these flowers right now.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The flower frequency--
through this frequency,

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:42.530 align:middle line:84%
send your angels to awaken,
activate the healing energy

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:44.610 align:middle line:90%

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.730 align:middle line:90%

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Very relaxing.

>>GRAY: And you can feel
all kinds [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Some people feel heat.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel
their hands get heavy.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel tingling
throughout their body.

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel
their hands tingling.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
even kind of burn.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.080 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
will take a while

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.250 align:middle line:84%
for the burning to go
away because just so

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:05.490 align:middle line:90%
much activation has happened.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.817 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So now we're at
the base of the spine.

00:55:08.817 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing is we're
going to bring the energy up.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:14.167 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Now, we're just going

00:55:14.167 --> 00:55:16.380 align:middle line:84%
That's good enough
for basic meditation.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So using these flowers,
send your angels

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
energy in my body.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.210 align:middle line:90%
You feel activation.

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.460 align:middle line:90%
You feel it in the fingertips.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:90%

you say, by your angels,

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:90%
take away my blocked energy.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Using these flowers, take
away the blocked energy.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, where's the
blocked energies?

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.390 align:middle line:84%
For some people watching, oh,
I'm positive all the time.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Then go back to a
time in your past

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.035 align:middle line:90%
where you weren't positive.

00:55:44.035 --> 00:55:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could also
be pain in your body.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.142 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Oh, that's the easiest.

00:55:47.142 --> 00:55:49.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why pain goes so
quickly with energy healing.

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Just feel the pain in your body.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Like for me, what I've been
doing over and over, which

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:58.270 align:middle line:84%
helps me with my grieving
is using these flowers,

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:02.080 align:middle line:84%
take away the pain in my
heart of missing my wife.

Take it away.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I love her so much.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Take it away.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Using these flowers,

take away the blocked
energy of my sadness.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because
sometimes when I'm doing this,

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I go, I don't want
you to take it away.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:19.772 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I want to hold onto it
because we think that sadness

00:56:19.772 --> 00:56:22.210 align:middle line:84%
means I love you because
you only get sad if you do

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:90%
love your partner.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But you can let
go of the sadness

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and be happy again and
still love your partner.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And still
love your partner.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.520 align:middle line:90%

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So using the
flowers, take away--

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and a big one is take away fear.

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Fear rules so much.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It's using these flowers,
take away the fear.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Take away the blocked
energy of my fears.

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:44.212 align:middle line:84%
And you can process your
whole childhood this way.

00:56:44.212 --> 00:56:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Recall a time in your
childhood-- everyone listening,

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.340 align:middle line:84%
recall a time in your
childhood when you were scared.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.600 align:middle line:90%
What were you afraid of?

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.100 align:middle line:90%
What did you need?

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:90%
What did you not have?

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Go back at that time and
feel the fear that you felt.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then asking God's
angels, using these flowers

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:09.160 align:middle line:84%
by God's angels, take away
the blocked energy of my fear.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.932 align:middle line:84%
Let the flowers just
take that energy,

00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:90%
and particularly cut flowers.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.280 align:middle line:84%
They love the energy because
they're not connected

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.558 align:middle line:90%
to the earth directly.

00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:17.725 align:middle line:90%

I don't want my negativity

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and really puts the
focus on something

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.278 align:middle line:84%
that's so much more powerful

00:57:58.278 --> 00:58:00.820 align:middle line:84%

>>GRAY: And you get in a loop.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, even when
you have the pain--

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.280 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking a
lot about emotions.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.020 align:middle line:84%
With all pain, there's always
some emotion that goes with it.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
part of the healing.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, if you're
really red-hot pain,

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:84%
just take away the
blocked energy of my pain.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Take away my pain.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is amazing

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.620 align:middle line:84%

Now, the energy's going out.

00:58:24.148 --> 00:58:26.440 align:middle line:84%

Using these flowers,

By your angels, take away the
blocked energy of my fear.

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Take it away, like a
mother holding a child.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You can amplify it with
little emotions there.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Like a mother holding me,
holding the little girl, little

Take away the blocked

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Take away the fear.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:08.448 align:middle line:84%
So as your energy's going out,
it's like you have a closet,

00:59:08.448 --> 00:59:09.740 align:middle line:90%

old clothes you

Get rid of all of it.

What do you do?

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.202 align:middle line:84%
You're going to immediately
buy new clothes, new.

00:59:15.202 --> 00:59:16.040 align:middle line:90%
You fill up.

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:16.850 align:middle line:90%
So you empty out--

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Clear the space.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:18.620 align:middle line:90%

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So what pulls energy in--

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:26.000 align:middle line:84%
next phrase-- is
this is bringing it

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.050 align:middle line:90%
up to your power center.

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:27.700 align:middle line:90%

>>GRAY: OK.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.230 align:middle line:84%
The power center is what
you want and what you will.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
intention and desire

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.188 align:middle line:90%
that pulls energy to you.

00:59:35.188 --> 00:59:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the people

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.760 align:middle line:84%
often have the biggest upsets
because they really want a lot.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And when it doesn't happen,
that energy gets jammed.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Desire pulls energy to us.

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:45.920 align:middle line:90%
We pull it.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.950 align:middle line:90%
The universe comes.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I want-- the universe sends us
energy to give us awareness,

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.120 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge, the
insight, the motivation--

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:52.920 align:middle line:90%

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:01.370 align:middle line:84%
you just say, by your

And then the way you

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.996 align:middle line:90%
start thinking, what do I want.

I want to make this

you just feel your soul's
desire at that time.

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.353 align:middle line:84%
And often, soul's desire is
more like I want to feel safe.

01:00:34.353 --> 01:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel loving.

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:36.437 align:middle line:90%

think about world peace.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.175 align:middle line:84%

that healing energy
to our bodies

01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and our planet and
our loved ones.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Everybody.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And this is a good
time, when your heart is open,

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
even to find forgiveness
for all those people

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:40.310 align:middle line:90%
that it's hard to find.

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Just say it in your heart.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:42.490 align:middle line:90%
And I forgive you.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I wish you well.

You know, I may not ever want
to see you again, [CHUCKLES]

01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
but I want you to be happy.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.355 align:middle line:90%
I want everybody to be.

01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a Buddhist prayer
that sometimes I'll

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
say when I'm pulling
energy in and letting it

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:54.340 align:middle line:90%
flow through me to the world.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's "may all
beings be happy.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:00.130 align:middle line:90%
May all beings be safe.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And may all beings
everywhere be free."

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's one more stage.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing the
energy up to the heart.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.040 align:middle line:84%
You've pulled the
energy in, and then

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
you just imagine all that
you've wanted has occurred.

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, that
is very important.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And using the flowers,
fill my heart with gratitude.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And you send energy
back to the flowers,

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
sharing it with the flowers.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Right now, this is
where you're no longer taking.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:27.783 align:middle line:84%
It's like when somebody
gives you something,

01:02:27.783 --> 01:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
you just want to give back.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And just feel gratitude for all,
for the world getting better,

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
for your children being happier,
for you feeling more peace

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
in your life, for the great
abundance in your life.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And I feel gratitude for
all the beautiful years

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I shared with Bonnie, grateful
for her lessons and her love

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and her support and
the beautiful family

01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
we have as a result.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's gratitude
that heals us,

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
but you really feel it if you
first empty out, then receive,

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and then you're grateful of
what you've just received.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.765 align:middle line:90%
And that's the gratitude.

01:02:57.765 --> 01:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
do the blessing.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.390 align:middle line:90%
"May all beings be happy.

was such a pleasure.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Now I want you to share.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel energy
in your body?

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's complete love.

I'm connected with
all those that

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
are watching in timelessness.

>>GRAY: And this is timeless.

01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
50 years from now,
if we're doing this,

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
we're all in this moment
together because this

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320 align:middle line:90%
is in the timeless zone.

It's beautiful.

01:03:36.665 --> 01:03:38.082 align:middle line:84%
I can't thank you
enough for this.

>>GRAY: Well, thank you
for letting me share this.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to now I
teach meditation classes.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the heart, but
you actually can go here, here,

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
back down here, back down
here, back down here,

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
back down here, and then
back, all the way up.

Now, there's many more
stations along the way,

01:03:53.732 --> 01:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%

grounded ones to move

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.293 align:middle line:84%

next, to the next.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%

with this meditation.

And you sit and
listen to music, even.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's so nice.

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Put on your favorite
music and use the music.

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I open my heart to, Spirit.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
