00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:19.071 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.721 align:middle line:10%
Inspirations," coming to you
from our beautiful Los Angeles

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:10%
studio.
Welcome.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Do you sneak candy bars
and then hide the wrappers?

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Or do you crave your first
morning cup of coffee,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and you basically can't
function without it?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Or do you need that after work
drink so that you can relax?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is
Dr. Hyla Cass, a board

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
certified psychiatrist
and one of the country's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
foremost experts on
integrative medicine.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cass combines the best
of alternative medicine

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
with modern science
in her books,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and an incredible
clinical practice

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:90%
that's very progressive.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
She's helped thousands of people
replace prescription drugs

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
with specific
nutrients that help

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
us maybe get off of
those prescription drugs

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:90%
or taper them down a bit.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
She's joining us to share
her secrets from her book

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:90%
"The Addicted Brain."

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so happy to be here.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about integrative medicine.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:90%
What is that exactly?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Integrative medicine is taking
the whole person in mind.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:10%
It's the mind, body, and spirit.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
We're integrated.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:10%
We're all of that.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:10%
And it's also integrating
east and west.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
It's the best of
all possible worlds.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine,
traditional medicine,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and functional medicine.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Functional medicine
is like looking

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
under the hood of a car,
really seeing what's going on.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Not just addressing
the symptoms.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's the
difference between that

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and alternative-- Western
medicine, so to speak?

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Like a regular MD.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Which you are also.
-I am.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:90%
I went to medical school.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I delivered babies, did surgery.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Very fun, actually.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I've really enjoyed that.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
However, what
conventional medicine does

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.435 align:middle line:90%
is treat symptoms.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have high
blood pressure?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you blood
pressure pills.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.777 align:middle line:90%
You have a rapid heart rate?

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you something
to slow your heart rate.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But nobody there is looking
at the entire picture.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:90%
What's the root cause?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.804 align:middle line:84%
Takes a lot more patience
to really get under the hood

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and look at the root
cause, because it could

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:90%
be so many different things.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:90%
It does take a lot of patience.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And on the patient's
part, it takes time.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And we want that quick fix.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.371 align:middle line:84%
We want that
solution right away.

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Fix me.
Fix me, doc.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a while
to really get to,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
what is the systemic problem
that's going on that's broken?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
People tend to want
a magic bullet,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
but the only thing is the
magic bullet doesn't work.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So after people have gone
through a lot of magic bullets

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that weren't so
magic, they come to me

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Come to you.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And then we work as partners.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I may be the expert, but the
patient has to participate.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So how many people come to you
that are on prescription drugs?

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Most of them.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones who aren't
have been given prescriptions

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
or recommend-- it's
been recommended

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:90%
that they take prescriptions.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.406 align:middle line:84%
And they come to me saying, I
don't want prescription drugs.

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:03.105 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Because--

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I've read about
the side effects,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
or my friend, or my
this and that-- I've

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:90%
seen the ravages of medications.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to do it naturally.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And there is such a movement,
and such a wonderful movement

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
thanks to people like you
of informed people who

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
want to do things differently.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So people come to you that
are already on their path.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They know a little
bit about nutrition.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.971 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel
fabulous all the time.

00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Yes.
-Mm-hm.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
really good at.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I know this about you,
because you have helped

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.627 align:middle line:90%
me with many different things.

00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You're really an expert in
hormones too, which we're going

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:90%
to talk about in a little bit.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's get
to "The Addicted Brain."

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Why is the brain--
and why do you

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
call it "The Addicted
Brain" rather

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
than the addictive personality?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
your personality.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It's your actual
brain biochemistry.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And people get
down on themselves,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
feeling that they're weak
or they're a bad person.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If they were only
a better person,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be addicted
to sugar, caffeine,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:90%
cocaine, donuts, whatever.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.335 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that.

00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the chemistry.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So you really
put sugar and cocaine

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.239 align:middle line:84%
and caffeine all in
the same category?

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hm.
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:90%
It looks that way, the same?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.654 align:middle line:84%
Some's legal, some's illegal,
but it's all the same.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same in the brain?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
The brain just wants-- the
brain wants what it wants.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:90%
The brain wants to feel good.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel good.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so if caffeine
is handy, do that.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
If sugar is what we can
get, we'll get that.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Cocaine-- it's whatever people
can get hold of because there's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:90%
such a need for us to feel OK.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And what
part of the brain

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
gets stimulated when it
goes after those highs?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, it's
really the entire brain.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's the limbic system,
the emotional system.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also related to
the cortex, which is the part

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:90%
that thinks and processes.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But really it's
a very primitive,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:90%
almost a survival mechanism.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Very often, what's
going on is people are--

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:90%
for example, low blood sugar.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So they're grabbing
for whatever it is.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain
gives you this message.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Danger, danger.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't have glucose
flowing into our brain cells,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.164 align:middle line:90%
then we could die.

00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so is that what
low blood sugar is?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's really the glucose
completely depleting

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
itself from the blood cells?

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.801 align:middle line:84%
Hm.
-Yeah.

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why you go for that
whatever isn't nailed down--

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Whatever.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.991 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend eating
regularly to prevent that.

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about-- so the brain.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It gets into-- the chemistry of
the brain needs to feel good.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It wants to feel good, so it's
going to reach for those things

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:90%
that feel good.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.995 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the myths
around addiction, if you will?

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Some of the common myths.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, it runs in my family.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
That's one of-- oh,
it runs in my family.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
My father, my mother,
my sister, my brother.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So I am going to be an addict.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth
of it is you will

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
have the propensity
because the genetics

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
will show up in your own body.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.201 align:middle line:84%
However, you're not a
slave to your genes.

00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that nice?
LISA GARR: That's fascinating.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: And that's great.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So what about an addiction
is the sign of a weakness

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
or a moral character?

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the myths
that you have in your book.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.429 align:middle line:84%
Yes?
No?

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: It's not--
you're not a weak person.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
You're not stupid.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:90%
You're not immoral.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:90%
You are just human.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're going after
what we see as survival.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The way people like myself
think is, its survival.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
You want to feel-- first of
all, you want to feel good.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you are, for
example, low blood sugar or low

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
in certain chemicals
in your brain,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
go after whatever

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
it takes to make those
brain chemicals go

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
up so that you feel normal.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:10%
So another myth, which you
say, which is very important,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:10%
that chronic addiction is a
disease that can be treated

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:10%
with prescription drugs.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.024 align:middle line:10%
Is that how people get into
that pathway in the first place?

00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:10%
HYLA CASS: Well,
there's two issues here.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:10%
One of them is that
very often when

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:10%
people go into an addiction
treatment facility,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:10%
they're given prescription
drugs in order to come

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:10%
off of the addictive substance.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that's such a good idea.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's urgent and
you really need to do that.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had people
withdraw using the right diet,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the right supplements
that'll get the brain

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
chemistry working properly.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so there wasn't
really a need

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.897 align:middle line:84%
for meds because it's a slippery
slope, as you can imagine.

00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:23.429 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I can imagine.
Right.

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So you mention different
amino acids that might

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
be able to help with balancing.
What is the idea?

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to
balance the blood sugar?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, blood
sugar is part of it,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and brain chemistry
overall is part of it.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot goes into
making a brain cell

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and in making your mood
good, happy, up, OK?

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So we need glucose,
which is carb.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
We need the glucose.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
We need protein to
make the amino acids.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:90%
So we need these amino acids.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we're deficient
in the amino acids.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
And we need fats.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important component.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a zero
fat diet or a really

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:90%
low fat diet, not so good.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I say fats,
I don't mean, like,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
eat a lot of French fries.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
You mean--
-Sorry, honey.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
-No, you mean the good fats.
-I mean the good fats.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I got that.
Hopefully we know that much.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.659 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Another myth that
drugs and alcohol

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:90%
are a case of substance abuse.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Drugs and alcohol are-- oh, are
the cause of substance abuse.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well,
drugs and alcohol

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
can cause-- actually,
if you start using them,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you will actually perpetuate
that because you're going

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:90%
to change your brain chemistry.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But very often, it's also
something you're born with.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is a propensity to be
low in certain neurochemicals.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
something called Reward

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Deficiency Syndrome, RDS.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you have reward
deficiency syndrome,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
you're chronically
low in dopamine.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And dopamine is
the neurochemical,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
the neurotransmitter, the
chemical messenger that

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel, hey, motivated.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Hi, good.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Happy, ready to go.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have
enough dopamine,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of low and
tired and you have ADD.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:90%
So it runs in families.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And there's a solution.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one solution
is gambling,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
dangerous behaviors
like little boys

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:90%
who jump up-- jump off roofs.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.787 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: In order
to get the dopamine--

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They want to get
the dopamine doing.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Release in the brain.
OK.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But we have much better
ways, much healthier

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:90%
ways to raise dopamine.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is to take
what are called precursors.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
We take more of the amino
acids that make dopamine.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That makes
a lot more sense.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a combination
of amino acids

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that create more dopamine
production in the brain.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Because we are chemical.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Now we're mind,
body, and spirit,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.940 align:middle line:84%
so that's not to say we
don't have a spiritual aspect

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and that we don't have choice.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course we have choice and we
have-- there's a lot going on.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm simply talking
about the chemist--

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
we're also a chemistry set.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's give this
chemistry set all

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
the raw materials that it needs
in order to function optimally.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you
can literally get

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
somebody off of a heavy
addiction with doing this.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And you literally have.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.049 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: I have.
Yeah, I have.

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds like, oh no.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You really need the
heavy artillery.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And the truth is, you don't.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, even for
example, we're talking

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
about addiction, but also
with depression, with anxiety.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not the heavy artillery.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.954 align:middle line:84%
It's just the right
substance, the right product.

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And
specifically, I mean, I

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
opened the show
talking about candy

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:90%
bars and caffeine and alcohol.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And so for-- I mean, we
could also be talking

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:90%
about the lighter things here.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking to get
rid of those carb addictions,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
what types of things
can you replace?

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Or what is the body looking
for that's addicted to carbs?

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the brain looking
for, I should ask?

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.081 align:middle line:84%
The brain's
looking for glucose.

00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: OK.
Again.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:10%
HYLA CASS: We have very
hungry brain cells.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:10%
These brain cells use up
20% of the body's glucose.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine That
this little brain.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:10%
It's, like, this big.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.981 align:middle line:10%
Weighs three pounds
on a good day.

00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:10%
Three pounds.
And it's like jelly.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very hungry organ.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So when it is low in sugar
or glucose, you feel yucky.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.067 align:middle line:90%
You're tired.

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
You can't think straight.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.804 align:middle line:90%
You have brain fog.

00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then
what about when

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
you put stress on that brain
and you make it overactive?

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Then it becomes more-- phew.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You've lowered your
blood sugar even more.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is the
stress hormones comes out.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:10%
The adrenali--

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Cortisol
and all that.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:10%
Uh-huh.
HYLA CASS: The cortisol.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.729 align:middle line:10%
You got it.

00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:10%
So the stress hormones come
out because they're saying,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:10%
oh, there's an emergency here.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:10%
The blood sugar is too low.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:10%
We need to make this better.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:10%
So it goes-- chu!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:10%
They come out.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:10%
These chemicals come
out and they make

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:10%
your cells release more sugar.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Sugar goes into the bloodstream.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.885 align:middle line:84%
And then the pancreas,
the sig-- oh,

00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:84%
there's all sorts of signals
going on in the body.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:90%
The pancreas says, oh, hey.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
There's too much sugar
hanging around here.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%
This isn't good.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And it ships some insulin
into the bloodstream.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And
what does that do?

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And the insulin
goes for the sugar.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.901 align:middle line:84%
Goes chu, to the glucose,
and pulls it into the cells.

00:11:58.901 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: To make it-- to keep
the-- because we don't want--

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.009 align:middle line:84%
So it spikes the insulin.
OK.

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Spikes-- we
get a spike of sugar,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and then we get a
spike of insulin.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Goes into the cell.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But what's often happening is
called reactive hypoglycemia.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Reactive hypoglycemia.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So you start off with
very high blood sugar.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:90%
The insulin comes, drip.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Takes it away.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with
low blood sugar.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
cycle all over again.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you're feeling like,
oh, I don't feel so good.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.417 align:middle line:84%
I need-- I need
another candy bar.

00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's why
you go for after--

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
if you have a lot of stress,
you go for something sugary.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You go for another
cup of coffee.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:90%
You go for the sugary drinks.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol has a lot of
sugar in it as well.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: That's exactly right.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so much of alcoholism
is actually low blood sugar.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Isn't that
interesting, right?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, as you
explained, the lack

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of production of sufficient
dopamine and serotonin

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, which could
either happen because of

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%
stress-- which, OK.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So now let's back it
up a little bit here.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
What can we do if we
have stressful lives?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, what types of nutrients
can we take in order to combat

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:90%
this cascade of effects?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
First of all, avoid
the simple carbs.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The simple carbs are
sugar, white flour.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:90%
We kind of know that.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
If it's white,
probably you shouldn't

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:90%
eat it, unless it's a rutabaga.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Because it spikes the sugar?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.509 align:middle line:84%
-It spikes the blood sugar.
-OK.

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you have spiked
blood sugar, you're in trouble.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And sugar, by the way,
high levels of blood sugar

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:90%
cause insulin resistance.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
If you keep going through this
cycle over and over again,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
insulin resistance.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So after a while,
it's like crying wolf,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
to be able to get

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
that sugar into the cells.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So your blood sugar rises
and it doesn't go down,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and you become pre-diabetic.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And you begin to gain weight.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It's also carcinogenic when
you have a lot of sugar

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and you have a lot of
insulin circulating.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
That's carcinogenic.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So bottom line is, stay away
from the sugar and white flour.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I mean, that could
explain the obesity epidemic.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The levels of stress
are, of course,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
rising with our
economic situation

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and our political
environment and all of that.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even-- and then
add on the job and the life

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
and the kids and the work.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this state of stress
more than we ever have been.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Life is busier and faster
than it ever has been.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: It's tough.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to
stress-proof ourselves.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.748 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Cass!

00:14:19.748 --> 00:14:21.323 align:middle line:84%
OK!
[LAUGH]

00:14:21.323 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what I tell
my patients and my readers.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Avoid the bad stuff.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The alcohol, the caffeine,
the sugar, the white flower.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Avoid the bad stuff.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.315 align:middle line:84%
And of course drugs of
abuse and prescriptions

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:90%
whenever you can avoid them.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And eat a really good,
healthy, natural diet

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:90%
that's well balanced.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier, you want
to have complex carbohydrates.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:84%
That's carbohydrates
that release slowly.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.661 align:middle line:84%
So that's root vegetables,
for example, whole grains.

00:14:48.661 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right.
-You know, the good stuff.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.153 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Good stuff.

00:14:51.153 --> 00:14:52.675 align:middle line:84%
So that's the carb.
Then protein.

00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
high quality protein.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Chicken, fish.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Meat's OK, just not in excess.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a vegetarian, there
are other sources of protein.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And good fats.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Those are all really important.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
If you eat that at every meal or
spread it out through the day--

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
let's say you don't
have fat at one meal.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of the world.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But the body kind of likes
that kind of balance.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of good
fat is, say, fish.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat salmon a few
times a week, you're doing

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
your brain a really big favor.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But see, we
eat like that already,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:90%
and we do exercise a little bit.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the stress or
the environmental factors

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.071 align:middle line:84%
are pushing our body
constantly into that zone.

00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:90%
So?

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: So we
need extra help.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring in
the reinforcements.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.349 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:15:34.349 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So you start with
a basic good--

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to do the
basic diet, and you

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:90%
have to do the exercise.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's a given.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
We're giving the fact that
everybody's doing that.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Do that.
-Yeah, we're all doing that.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
For sure.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Take it to the
next level for us.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.826 align:middle line:84%
You don't sit in front of the
TV eating popcorn all night,

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:90%
or candy.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Some nights, but
that's all right.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
-Well--

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so take it to
the next level for us.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:10%
HYLA CASS: The next
level is to have

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:10%
small, frequent
meals so that you're

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:10%
not having blood sugar dips.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:10%
Because the stress
is going to happen.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Your blood sugar's going
to go shifting around.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.891 align:middle line:10%
So make sure that you have
reinforcements in you.

00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:10%
So that's another
piece of the puzzle.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Then another thing to
do is to take vitamins.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
A multivitamin is
really, really useful

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.681 align:middle line:84%
because it's helping to
restore what you're burning up.

00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And look, our
food supply kind of

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
is-- even if you're
eating organically,

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
even the organic food does not
have the level of nutrients

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:90%
that we had in the old days.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So it should just be in
your diet no matter what.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Just take a really
good, high quality,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
high potency multivitamin.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now you know
about the green juice

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
movement and all of
the wonderful nutrients

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that come in green juices.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Would that be a supplement
in case you're-- I mean,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to do the multi?

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think in addition
to the green juices--

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: I love green juices.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.981 align:middle line:84%
But I also say, you
know, a little insurance.

00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there are trace
minerals and trace vitamins.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
There's vitamins and trace
minerals in the vitamin pill

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that you may not get
in the green juice.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So that just kind of covers--
you want to cover everything.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot of margin.
LISA GARR: No.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.944 align:middle line:84%
And the flu seasons seem to be
getting more and more intense.

00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in the middle
of an epidemic right now.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think it is important
to give the body extra.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.571 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is just
the way it's going to be.

00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.
I think so.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting any
less, these flu seasons.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting
more and more intense.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you don't
run towards the flu shot.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
What would we run towards
instead to boost the immunity?

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, all those
things that I said.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And take vitamin C,
extra vitamin C. I have

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
everybody on two grams a day.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.695 align:middle line:90%
That's 2,000 milligrams.

00:17:36.695 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And take it at two
different times,

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's fairly
short acting.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So 2,000, like 1,000
here and 1,000 here.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Even better, 500, 500, 500.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
But people don't do that.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming
down with a cold,

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
take vitamin C to
bowel tolerance.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
That is till you
start to feel gassy.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yep.
Mm-hm.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.049 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Very-- I mean,
it sounds simple.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But you know, animals
make vitamin C.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We're the only animals,
besides hamsters, that don't.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.005 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that odd?

00:18:02.005 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Us and hamsters.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.906 align:middle line:90%
How do you like that?

00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:06.572 align:middle line:84%
Real quickly, what do you
feel about the flu shots?

00:18:06.572 --> 00:18:08.305 align:middle line:84%
I know it's off topic here,
but I've got to ask you.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:09.938 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, the flu
shot is a little tricky,

00:18:09.938 --> 00:18:11.471 align:middle line:84%
because they're basing
it on last year's flu.

00:18:11.471 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
It also can give
you side effects.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.394 align:middle line:90%
You can actually get the flu.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You can get a mild
case of the flu.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Mild.
Uh-huh.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, what do
you think's in the flu vaccine?

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
You think it's just
simply some killed virus?

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Like, please.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It is heavily processed.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.157 align:middle line:90%
Heavily processed.

00:18:27.157 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Thermasal--

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.289 align:middle line:84%
-Thiomersal.
-OK.

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Thiomersal.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of crap.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.137 align:middle line:84%
So the things that you
do not want in your body.

00:18:34.137 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all these chemicals.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they're going to do?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you think these
chemicals are going to do?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
You think they're going to
just come in and go out?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
So they stay in our body.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Mercury,
heavy metals.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
viruses bind to, right?

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
In order to be in the flu shot.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:90%
To process it.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
In order to process a flu
shot, in order to make it,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
it has to go through
a lot of chemical--

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So I mean, if
people do take the flu shot,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
is it better to do it
when you're healthy,

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
not when you're sick?

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: No, you
should ever do a--

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: A flu shot
when you're sick.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't take any kind of
[INAUDIBLE] when you're sick.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going back
to something else,

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is that in
kids who are autistic,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
there are many cases in
which the child was given

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
a vaccine when they were sick.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
In fact, there are twins.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:90%
One kid was sick, one wasn't.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Same genes.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
One kid became autistic,
the other didn't.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, my goodness.
Wow.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.706 align:middle line:90%
And that's interesting.

00:19:22.706 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: So that's a
little aside, but you know,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:90%
it's all part of the mix.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is important
to know that there

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
are so many different
additives in these flu shots.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.744 align:middle line:90%
Back to how to boost--

00:19:31.744 --> 00:19:33.309 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Or if you're
going to do a flu shot,

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:90%
do it when you're healthy.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And then take something
afterwards, a homeopathic,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.467 align:middle line:84%
to help neutralize
the side effects.

00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, that's right.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:90%
There are-- that's right.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of-- OK.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So we were-- thank you
for that, by the way,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%
because it's very relevant.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
addiction and different myths

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:90%
of addiction, and so forth.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Another one is that there
has to be a relapse,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.497 align:middle line:90%
that it's part of recovery.

00:19:56.497 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Part of recovery.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, of course you're
going to relapse.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: You don't have to.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:10%
No, you don't have to relapse.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm telling you that
if you follow lifestyle

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:10%
recommendations of eating
correctly, taking vitamins,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:10%
and then taking very
specific amino acids--

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and these are the ones that
help to raise dopamine, to raise

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:10%
serotonin, raise GABA-- if you
take all of these and fish oil,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:10%
my patients don't relapse.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hate to say it
like, oh, my patient's don't.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But I can keep
people-- if they're

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.625 align:middle line:90%
well motivated-- the cravings.

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
You see, they're not going to
be a slave to their cravings.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.915 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
these poor people,

00:20:36.915 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
they white knuckle
themselves into sobriety.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And bless them for it.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.119 align:middle line:84%
Bless them for it.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's always a
struggle with the cravings.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people--
I mean, I had

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
this one case a few years ago.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:90%
This man-- I actually knew him.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
He was an acquaintance,
and I said,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I just developed these vitamins.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd like you to try them.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Because he was nine months sober
from a really bad meth habit.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.384 align:middle line:84%
So I said, why don't you try
my brain recovery packets?

00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, I
don't need vitamins.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.249 align:middle line:90%
I'm great.

00:21:06.249 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm clean and
sober, nine months.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing great.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.065 align:middle line:84%
Except he didn't have a job
and he was kind of tired.

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, humor me.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Try them.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
He calls me four days later.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:90%
He said, what's in it?

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, I have my energy.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm sleeping right
through the night.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm dreaming and
remembering my dreams.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And he actually put in
some job applications

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and got a job, which he still
has now several years later.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So life
can be so much

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
better with supplementation.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: So
isn't that amazing?

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So he was white
knuckling it, actually.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't quite realize that
being clean and sober for him,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
while it was a wonderful
accomplishment,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
could be actually a better--
he could have a better quality

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.917 align:middle line:90%
of life than he was getting.

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And
that's interesting.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have put
together different formulas

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
for focus and for-- for
brain recovery and health,

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think that
we live in that world

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
now, that we live in a
world where we-- our bodies

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:90%
are taxed more than they were.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: And we need
to use-- we need to use

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.465 align:middle line:90%
chemistry with chemistry.

00:22:01.465 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:90%
To assist the chemistry.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Like earlier when
you were saying,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
what do you do
about the adrenals,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:84%
about stress and about
being stress-proof?

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.054 align:middle line:90%
Take adaptogens.

00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: What are those?

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Adaptogens.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.245 align:middle line:90%
They help you adapt.

00:22:13.245 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:90%
They help you adapt to stress.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:90%
They are God's gift, OK?

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:90%
They're from the herbal world.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.931 align:middle line:84%
And Western medicine
has no equivalent.

00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: OK.
OK.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.077 align:middle line:84%
These are-- and it's
ashwagandha, reishi mushroom,

00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
ginseng-- you've
heard of ginseng.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's eleuthro,
which is Siberian ginseng.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Rhodiola.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And these are just wonderful,
plant-based compounds.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
They literally come from plants.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:90%
They're extracts.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we take
them, we're getting

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.065 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot of nutrition.

00:22:45.065 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But why
doesn't Western medicine

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:90%
have an equivalent?

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Or why can they not patent
these various nutrients

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that come from
the ground, roots?

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, they can do use
patents, but it's a little bit

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
hard because there they are.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
They're in nature.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.403 align:middle line:84%
They're not manufactured
in a-- plants

00:23:00.403 --> 00:23:01.436 align:middle line:90%
aren't manufactured in a plant.

00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:02.879 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
LISA GARR: Right.

00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not made by the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical industry
is there to make money.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.905 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the truth.

00:23:09.905 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not there--

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Interesting
that you would say that.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
 --because they want to
take care of your health.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.553 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's face it.

00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's business.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
It's big business, and we have
to realize that, appreciate

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceuticals for
when we need them,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and don't have any illusions
that they're there to help you.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:10%
As a whole, as an industry.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.435 align:middle line:10%
And be aware that when you can't
get something pharmaceutically,

00:23:28.435 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:10%
and you can get it
through the health food

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:10%
store or your health
provider, it's

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.734 align:middle line:10%
because it's not patentable.

00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So our health food stores become
our new pharmacies, in a sense.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to use it
the right way-- I mean,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
you can go and get
multivitamins off the shelf.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
talking about here

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is different ways to turn on
certain pathways in the body

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:90%
so that it works optimally.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.710 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: We're giving the
body exactly what it needs.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how people
go into health food stores

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:90%
and know what to buy.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's confusing.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I get confused.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I go into a health food store--

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We have actually a video
that I want to show you

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Cass has done,
talking about some

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of these things that
help support our body.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Cass, in your practice,
you see a great number

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:10%
of individuals who have been,
for one reason or another,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:10%
become addicted to
mood altering drugs.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what you do
to help that individual get

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
stabilized and then
on long-term to take

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.021 align:middle line:84%
care of the kinds of things
that created the need?

00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Sure.
That's an excellent question.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:10%
What happens is people are
put on a mood altering drug.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:10%
They're put on an antidepressant
such as Prozac, Zoloft,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:10%
Lexapro, Celexa, whatever.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when they
try to go off these drugs,

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's appropriate for
them to go off them--

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:84%
you really don't want to
be on them your whole life.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
When they start to
go off the drug,

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll find they
have what's called

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:84%
discontinuation syndrome,
which is basically

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
like withdrawing from any drug.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:84%
When you see heroin
addicts going

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:84%
through all the terrible--
the sweating, the stomach

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
aches, and the
really nasty things

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
they go through, or cocaine
addicts, or any kind of addict.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
When they getting off a drug,
what happens is the brain

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:84%
has already become accustomed
to being a certain way.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And you take away
the substance--

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and it can be also
a prescription drug,

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
one that's written by a doctor.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be a stimulant drug.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
All of these things will
alter your brain receptivity.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
your brain to get

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
used to being off
of the drug, you

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:90%
have to withdraw fairly slowly.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's unfortunate is that
many physicians won't do that.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell someone, oh,
you can just go off the drug.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Or take them off too quickly.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what happens is
they begin to have symptoms.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctor
will say, see.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Told you you shouldn't
go off that drug.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:90%
You really need it.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need it
the rest of your life.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this so
many times from patients.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.635 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply
because its physiology.

00:26:06.635 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
If you take a mood
altering substance

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:84%
for any length of time,
changes your brain chemistry,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
changes how your
receptors are working.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
withdraw very, very slowly.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And then what I put in--
this is the difference

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
where the doctors who practice
nutritional medicine are

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
different-- is that I
will add in some vitamins

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and amino acids and
herbs that help bridge.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So that rather than
depending on that drug,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
you begin to replace
what's missing

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and to reactivate the
receptors using nutrients.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.945 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is the
whole process becomes quicker.

00:26:47.945 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take you as
long to go off of the drug.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing that happens

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.715 align:middle line:84%
is, for example, if somebody's
coming off of an SSRI,

00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
a Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitor, as I mentioned,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Zoloft, Celexa Lexapro, when
they're going off of that

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and I give them a
serotonin enhancer

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
like 5-Hydroxytryptophan
together with some B

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
vitamins, that's actually
going to help make serotonin.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So not only is it going to
help bridge that withdrawal,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
but when they are
finally off of the drug,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
they may need to take
that 5-Hydroxytryptophan

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because they may have
their own predisposition.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's different.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And some people just
need more than others.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.704 align:middle line:84%
And that'll take care
of the initial problem

00:27:31.704 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
so that they're not going
to need to be on a drug.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.175 align:middle line:84%
They may need to be on
this amino acid 5-HTP

00:27:36.175 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and they may need to be on
vitamins either for the rest

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
of their life in
some form or other,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
or at least for a
certain amount of time.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But that's great.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you're giving is
something natural that the body

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:90%
is missing and needs.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
to find out various things

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
that we can use in order to make
us feel better in order to get

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:90%
our quality of life back.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:10%
I think sometimes when we
go through slow-- slowly

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:10%
accumulative stress,
we don't realize

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:10%
that several years later,
we're just feeling horrible.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
We think it's normally
the aging process

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.634 align:middle line:84%
and that we're
just getting older,

00:28:09.634 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:90%
and those types of things.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.021 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually feel
even better as you age, right?

00:28:14.021 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:10%
It's so-- it's kind
of a sad commentary,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:10%
because so many people
are in that position.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:10%
They've had a lot of stress,
and they're worn out.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.731 align:middle line:10%
And they're tired,
and they're depressed.

00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:10%
And what happens?

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:10%
They go to their doctor and
get a prescription for an SSRI.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.057 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't really
cover the problem.

00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't take care of
the problem at all.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And it just gives them
a bunch of side effects.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And we also know from research
that most of the effects

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.944 align:middle line:90%
of the SSRIs is placebo effect.

00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So what do
you mean, it really

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:90%
doesn't solve the problem?

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it--

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.523 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: It's not doing
with what the issue is.

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're really
tired like that, what's really

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:90%
going on is adrenal burnout.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that your
adrenals have actually burned

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:90%
out, but it's just a way of--

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: A term.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
 --it's a term where
your cortisol is low.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
As it's if it's been
pumping cortisol and pumping

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:84%
cortisol, and it's finally
just saying, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.480 align:middle line:84%
That's enough.
You know?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
So the switch goes off.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling-- you
just don't have your get up

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:90%
and go anymore.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.990 align:middle line:90%
You think, oh, I'm old.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired.
It's the end of it.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Or, I'm depressed.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, you go
for the prescription.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Or you go for the caffeine.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's really going on
is the adrenals need help.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I really
differ from other physicians,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
from conventional docs,
because they come to me,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and I will actually
put them on adaptogens.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll even use, by
the way, compounded--

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is from a compounding
pharmacy-- cortisone.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not prednisone,
which is highly concentrated.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to
shut down your adrenals.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help you adrenal
glands have a better shot.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.341 align:middle line:84%
Is that hydrocortisone,
or same thing, or--

00:29:44.341 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.
-That's the same thing.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good kickstarter
to get you out of that adrenal

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:90%
completely fatigue.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something that
you stay with for a while.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: You don't
have to stay on forever.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going
to suppress your own,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and you don't
become hooked on it.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
See, the problem with
so many-- with the drugs

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.544 align:middle line:84%
is your body gets hooked.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:30:01.544 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a second.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So the serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So what that basically means
is pulls the serotonin,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and then it's--
pulls it in the brain

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and prevents it from releasing.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:90%
How is that not good?

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, what happens
is the serotonin is a messenger.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's one cell.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's the other cell.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And this cell sends a message.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.405 align:middle line:84%
It sends a little
serotonin molecule.

00:30:26.405 --> 00:30:27.182 align:middle line:90%
Do, do, do.

00:30:27.182 --> 00:30:28.515 align:middle line:84%
And it does, do, do
through the synapse,

00:30:28.515 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:90%
through this liquid, your fluid.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And it goes-- hits
the other cell.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.744 align:middle line:84%
And the other cell says, oh.
That feels good.

00:30:34.744 --> 00:30:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a receptor
there for the serotonin,

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and it feels that.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It gets that serotonin
hit, and it feels happy.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now ordinarily, that serotonin
molecule will be taken

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:90%
up by the cell and recycled.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Turned into its components
and whatever happens.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But with SSRIs, it hits
the receptor and the SSRI

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
prevents it from
being taken up again.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
a reuptake inhibitor.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.091 align:middle line:84%
So it sits around, and it has
a chance to do another hit,

00:31:02.091 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and another hit.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you know,
along comes the other scavenger

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
enzymes like MAO,
Monoamine Oxidase,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and does actually use
up that serotonin.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:90%
So eventually-- we know this.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.751 align:middle line:84%
People on antidepressants,
they stop working.

00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right.
Right.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to up
the dose, you have

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:90%
to add another antidepressant.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, all kinds of things.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.224 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
solve the problem.

00:31:24.224 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then people
want to go cold turkey,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.357 align:middle line:84%
because they don't feel
that they're working

00:31:27.357 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
or they're having--
HYLA CASS: Oh, boy.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I see that a lot
too where they just--

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm off my antidepressants.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what?
[LAUGH]

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And what do you notice?

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, they get very depressed.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.975 align:middle line:90%
Or they cannot function.

00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: They can't
function mostly, yeah.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: It's awful.
It's awful.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they go to their
doctor, and the doctor says,

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.861 align:middle line:84%
see, I told you you had to be
on it for the rest your life.

00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Ah!
I mean, that is so wrong.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I help people to
get off of antidepressants.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very important.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:84%
If they need them--
I mean, look.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
If something's
working and it's OK,

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying everybody
should get off their drugs.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a personal choice,
and it's a whole other story.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But if someone wants to go
off of their medication,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:84%
they should have a
trial of going off,

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.780 align:middle line:84%
because they may
not need it anymore.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So you gradually lower
the dose while adding

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:90%
in the supplements.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.555 align:middle line:90%
And I have a program.

00:32:16.555 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You add in the amino acids,
you add in the co-factors,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the vitamins and
minerals that work,

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
with the amino acids to help
make the neurotransmitters.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, you take a
tryptophan or 5-HTP,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:90%
and that makes serotonin.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'd rather give someone
by 5-HTP or tryptophan

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to make more serotonin, to
make those hits, than fooling

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:84%
the brain into
thinking there's more,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
many side effects.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.900 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That
makes so much sense.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
You have such a great
way of explaining things.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
You've got, like, a
whole animation going.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.356 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes it out of
those complicated medical terms,

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and brings it to a way
that I can picture it.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So taking tryptophan,
taking 5-HTP.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:90%
What about the B vitamins?

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.164 align:middle line:84%
Do they help in that
process as well?

00:32:59.164 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: B vitamins are great.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, we know that
there's the stress B vitamins.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
stressed, the B

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.960 align:middle line:84%
vitamins are used to make those
hormones, the stress hormones.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the stress hormones
are along the same pathway

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:90%
as your neurotransmitters.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why when you're really

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:84%
stressed, your brain hormones,
your brain neurotransmitters,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:90%
go south too.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.971 align:middle line:84%
Because you only have
so much raw material.

00:33:21.971 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.234 align:middle line:84%
You can't think and
you can switch things.

00:33:25.234 --> 00:33:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're just not
functioning on all cylinders.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So taking amino acids, you
can take mixed amino acids.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Eat high protein meals.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And then take specific ones.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
have a depression--

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and I have a questionnaire
here in another book I have,

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.094 align:middle line:84%
"Natural Highs,"
that's an older book.

00:33:40.094 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And then there's my
"Addicted Brain" book where

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this as well.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
That if you're feeling
depressed but anxious--

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.355 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're wired and
you can't sleep at night,

00:33:50.355 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
you're eating too many
carbs-- that's pretty

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.645 align:middle line:90%
much a serotonin deficiency.

00:33:53.645 --> 00:33:54.345 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah.

00:33:54.345 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Very good to know.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Call in the 5-HTP.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So 5-HTP, you can get
at the health food store.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:84%
You can take it before
you go to sleep.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And what levels do you
recommend for someone who

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:90%
is not coming off of an SSRI?

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: I'd start
with 50 milligrams.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.595 align:middle line:84%
Go up to 100, 150,
200 milligrams.

00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:13.212 align:middle line:84%
I have people on 300
of 5-HTP at bedtime.

00:34:13.212 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Or I have people take
it in the morning.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.087 align:middle line:84%
100 in the morning,
200 at night.

00:34:17.087 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, 100 in the
morning and 200 at night.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I have this-- this one woman
was telling me that, she said,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
she knows when she forgot to
take her 5-HTP in the morning

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.069 align:middle line:84%
when she finds her
husband irritating her.

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.736 align:middle line:84%
He's irri-- he's more
irritating because she

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:90%
didn't take her 5-HTP.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.634 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have
our happiness on.

00:34:34.634 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: That's exactly.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Is there any side
effect from 5-HTP?

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Does it make you tired?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: It can make
you tired in some people.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And so if it makes you
tired, take it at bedtime.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if you
mix it with an SSRI,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.239 align:middle line:84%
you have to be
careful because you

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
can have serotonin syndrome,
which is excess of serotonin.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is
on an SSRI, I have

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to take the actual
5-HTP or L-tryptophan

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
away from it, at least
two hours away from it.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What's a
sero-- serotonin-- what

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:90%
did you just mention it was?

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.329 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: A serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:08.028 align:middle line:84%
No, the-- too much serotonin.
What--

00:35:08.028 --> 00:35:09.589 align:middle line:84%
-Serotonin syndrome.
-Yes.

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:11.139 align:middle line:84%
What is that?
How would you know--

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Something you do
not want to have.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.196 align:middle line:90%
Serotonin syndrome is serious.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It occurs when--
usually it's when

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.505 align:middle line:84%
you add two drugs together.
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:35:20.505 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Like an SSRI,
and then something

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:84%
that prevents the
SSRI from breaking

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:84%
down properly, like something
that's an MAO inhibitor.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know when people
are on MAO inhibitors,

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.797 align:middle line:84%
they can't take SSRIs because
you can get serotonin syndrome.

00:35:34.797 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Gets so complicated.
-I know.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes.
Yes.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.426 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: But it's
actually-- it's pretty simple.

00:35:38.426 --> 00:35:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking anything
that enhances serotonin

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and you get too much of it--
and that's not likely to happen

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
with adding amino acids
to an antidepressant,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be-- I have
to give people warning--

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
high blood pressure, you
get a headache, you sweat,

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:90%
you feel really horrible.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:90%
You really notice it.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.926 align:middle line:84%
It's not just something that
you have to sit and worry-- ooh,

00:35:57.926 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:90%
do I have serotonin syndrome?

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:90%
You know when you have it.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you
stop taking everything

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and you call your doctor.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:84%
All right.
Good to know.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
That's important.
HYLA CASS: And then it stops.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it is,
it stops the process.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.146 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, many
people are hearing

00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:90%
this for the first time.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Now do you think that its ever
a good idea to take an SSRI when

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe you've had
a death or you're

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:84%
grieving a loss, or
something for short term.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that as a
way of introducing--

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that doctors introduce
SSRIs into people's lives.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- or can you really
accomplish the same thing

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.134 align:middle line:84%
with this amino acid
combination with the 5-HTP

00:36:30.134 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, this
is such a good point.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't tell
you how many people

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in the grieving process
are given SSRIs and given

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:90%
tranquilizers.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.601 align:middle line:84%
10, 15, 20 years later,
they're still on them.

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
I know.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's ridiculous,
because they can't get off

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
the medication, because it's
such a difficult withdrawal

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:90%
for some of them.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I come in,
and I really do help people

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:84%
very gradually to get
off of these medications

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:90%
with these supplements.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I talked about that in
"The Addicted Brain."

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And for grieving, by the
way, you have to grieve.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, you take an
SSRI, it'll take edge off.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.707 align:middle line:84%
But it can take off
more than the edge.

00:37:11.707 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
women who said she

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:84%
couldn't cry at her
mother's funeral

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
because she was on an SSRI.
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's not good.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.391 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able
to feel your feelings.

00:37:18.391 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Mm-hm.
[INAUDIBLE] the process.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at another video here

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that goes back
into the addictions

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:90%
and "The Addictive Brain" book.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me an
idea of how someone

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:90%
goes about treating addiction?

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.825 align:middle line:10%
Addiction has been treated
kind of as a stepchild

00:37:34.825 --> 00:37:35.525 align:middle line:10%
of psychiatry.

00:37:35.525 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:10%


00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:43.165 align:middle line:10%
People look on addicts as being
weak, poor moral character.

00:37:43.165 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
If they would just get it
together, use self-control.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, in a way, the
12 step programs kind of feed

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.630 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, I have to say,

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I do appreciate AA and the
other 12 step programs,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
because they really
do help people

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:90%
have a support structure.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
extremely important.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But what they've missed is that
there's a biochemical component

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.830 align:middle line:90%
to addiction.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Now Bill W. knew that.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
He had contact
with Abram Hoffer.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And Abram Hoffer told
him about what's called

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:90%
orthomolecular psychiatry.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:90%
That is, using nutrients.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:90%
So he was onto it.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Bill W. was onto it, but
AA never adopted that.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So you go to an AA meeting--
so I hear, because I haven't

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
actually been to one-- but
I know people are smoking,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:84%
drinking coffee, eating
cake and cookies,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.780 align:middle line:90%
all the bad stuff, right?

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Not because they're bad
people or stupid or weak,

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.590 align:middle line:84%
but because their brain
chemistry's out of whack.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So the very same
things that they're

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:84%
turning to now-- the sugar, the
caffeine, the whatever it is

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that they're using,
the cigarettes--

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are to raise their
dopamine level.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
they had their addiction

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in the first place, because
their dopamine level

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and their other brain
chemicals were out of balance.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you can help
someone rearrange

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:84%
their neurotransmitters and
replenish the deficiencies,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the cravings are
going to go away.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's just what I do.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When I'm seeing patients
and they're addicted,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll give them tyrosine,
phenylalanine, glutamine.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Those are my favorites
in terms of amino acids

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:90%
for treating these situations.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
There's also an herb
called kudzu, K-U-D-Z-U,

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that really does help to
metabolize alcohol and to stop

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.700 align:middle line:90%
the alcohol cravings.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I even developed--
what happened was out

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of self-defense, I actually
developed a set of products

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of Brain Recovery AM
and Brain Recovery PM,

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.810 align:middle line:84%
because people in recovery, when
they're dealing with addiction,

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.150 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard
for them to figure

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:90%
out how to count their pills.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I could take
this in the morning,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and then I take one of
these and three of these,

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and they get confused
because they don't

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.945 align:middle line:90%
have their full brain function.

00:39:55.945 --> 00:39:57.150 align:middle line:90%
So I made it very simple.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:90%
I have a morning packet.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Take a packet with breakfast,
a packet with dinner.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are
multivitamins in both.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
There's fish oil in
both, because you

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.470 align:middle line:84%
need the essential fatty
acids for your brain.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
There's amino acids in both,
and there's blood sugar

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:90%
balancing products in both.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So when you've taken the two
packets, what you've done

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is help to rebalance your brain
chemistry so that the cravings

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:90%
are going to go away.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And when someone's addicted,
they're not a bad, weak person.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.200 align:middle line:90%
They are deficient.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we can give them what
they need-- and very often,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:90%
they're low blood sugar as well.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So they have to make sure to eat
the appropriate-- eat probably

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.640 align:middle line:84%
three to five meals a day, make
sure they have enough chromium

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and enough glutamine to help
balance their blood sugar,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and to eat good,
healthful foods.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from the bad
stuff, because that's

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.225 align:middle line:84%
only going to perpetuate
the addiction cycle.

00:40:46.225 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat well,
that goes a long way

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.100 align:middle line:84%
toward even mitigating
the cravings

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and to restoring
your brain chemistry

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.060 align:middle line:90%
to where it should be.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
you're saying is

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
you need to go a lot
further than just belonging

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to an organization
where you are there

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.900 align:middle line:84%
with a number of
other people who

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:90%
are fighting the same problem.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You need the help to be
able to hopefully overcome

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
the craving and these other
things that are really

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.631 align:middle line:84%
very prevalent, but are replaced
by the coffee and things

00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
like that.
-The coffee and doughnuts.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
speak at AA programs.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I think they've
done a fabulous job

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:84%
in taking people--
taking people in, giving

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:90%
them support, having sponsors.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the
really positive effect.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But this one piece would
be so important, so

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:34.040 align:middle line:84%
vital, to introduce the role of
nutrition, of eating properly,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:84%
taking out the bad stuff and
adding in the good stuff,

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
like my brain recovery
packets or anything like it.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.621 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the ingredients
and get an equivalent somewhere.

00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:43.320 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So I promised that we were going
to talk about hormonal issues,

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
which I know you are a great
expert in, and how to-- I mean,

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.200 align:middle line:84%
hormones can be so
confusing for women.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:10%
And for the men who
have women that are

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:10%
confused about the hormones.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, sometimes they
play tricks with your mind,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.485 align:middle line:10%
and you don't know
how you are or why

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:10%
you are reacting
in a certain way,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:10%
and it's really the
hormones talking.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And the men go, what is--
what happened to her?

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Where did she go?

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Where did she go?

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.123 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
what do you mean?

00:42:10.123 --> 00:42:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Who is this imposter?

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.120 align:middle line:90%
She looks like her, but I know.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.440 align:middle line:90%
She's not who I married.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.691 align:middle line:84%
And the men know exactly
what we're talking about.

00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
I mean, really female--

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Chemistry.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing what happens.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Your hormones shift.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.790 align:middle line:90%
And women's hormones shift.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We have cycles, and
that's how it is.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:10%
But you don't have to suffer
from these hormonal shifts.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.120 align:middle line:10%
What I'm saying is--
LISA GARR: News flash.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.654 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]
-News flash.

00:42:33.654 --> 00:42:34.741 align:middle line:10%
Not a hot flash.
A news flash.

00:42:34.741 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
So when-- PMS is rampant, right?

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's worse
than it used to be.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.940 align:middle line:90%
The usual.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Our nutrition's terrible.
LISA GARR: Stress.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
drinking Cokes and caffeine

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.795 align:middle line:84%
and eating sugar, what do
you think's going to happen?

00:42:47.795 --> 00:42:49.229 align:middle line:84%
Your hormones are going
to be out of whack.

00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:49.961 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, really?

00:42:49.961 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because your hormones,
just like we were talking

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.820 align:middle line:84%
about neurotransmitters,
they need carbohydrates,

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:90%
proteins, fats, you know?

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:84%
You need all this good
stuff to make hormones.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't
have it, when we're

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:84%
making hormones out of nothing,
there's a real problem.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.065 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
stress, what happens?

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The raw materials are going
to make the stress hormones,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.641 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to
make the female hormones.

00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: OK.
OK.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So--
-So we have a problem.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:90%
However, it's solvable.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.724 align:middle line:84%
One of the things--
isn't that nice?

00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:22.189 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I love that.
-Isn't that nice?

00:43:22.189 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I have solutions.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I have a solution for you.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.181 align:middle line:84%
PMS, so often with PMS,
women are low in magnesium.

00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're stressed,
your magnesium goes south.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Your B6 goes south.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin B6 and magnesium
are brilliant for PMS.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
herbs that we can

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.770 align:middle line:90%
use, specific herbs for PMS.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've put together
some formulas for PMS

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because-- and of
necessity for a lot

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:84%
of wonderful young women
who, during PMS time,

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:90%
turn into witches.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And they don't like it either.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So giving them magnesium,
fish oil, evening

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:84%
primrose oil, by PMS balance
and watching their diet,

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and exercising.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Makes a tremendous difference.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- chu!

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a total switch.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's
a restart button.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.835 align:middle line:90%
It's a restart.

00:44:07.835 --> 00:44:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And if that-- sometimes we
have to tweak it even more

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and add a little progesterone.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Progesterone's very safe.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:90%
You use natural progesterone.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And your body
produces progesterone anyway,

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
but why does that go
down when you're--

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes we have low
progesterone, particularly

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:90%
when there's a lot of stress.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of
making progesterone,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.470 align:middle line:90%
your body's making cortisol.

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:90%
So it starts making--

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's called
the cortisol steal.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is stealing
progesterone.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.114 align:middle line:90%
And we need progesterone.

00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What
about testosterone?

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Do women produce
testosterone as well?

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We make it in the
adrenal glands.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And viva testosterone,
because it helps with libido.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We need estrogen, progesterone,
and testosterone for libido.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:84%
We need it all.
LISA GARR: Huh.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if the adrenals
are shot and if you're

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.340 align:middle line:84%
drinking a lot of
caffeine and so forth,

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and so your
progesterone is shot,

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that's why women have
such bad experiences

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:84%
where they're going through
menstrual cycles, menopause.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that what a hot flash is?

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.871 align:middle line:84%
Is it created from
an out of balance--

00:45:10.871 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Well, it's
from out of balance.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
describing, you end up

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.910 align:middle line:84%
with low libido, irritability,
depression, brain fog.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.670 align:middle line:84%
You're just not
operating properly.

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then
you reach for the SSRI.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I see.
-There you go.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.669 align:middle line:84%
You go to your doc, and, oh.
SSRI.

00:45:25.669 --> 00:45:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Without even thinking,
these docs are-- I mean,

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I have such a thing about this.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just really
appreciate the opportunity to be

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:90%
able to talk here about this--

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's important.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.820 align:middle line:90%
 --and have your support.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Because these poor
women, they're on SSRIs.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you think SSRIs do
to your libido, by the way?

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, right.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.820 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
big side effects.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hm.
HYLA CASS: No libido.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:10%
The other thing that
really kills you

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.834 align:middle line:10%
libido, oral contraceptives.

00:45:48.834 --> 00:45:49.700 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Does it really?

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new
study that came out

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that showed the dangers of
oral contraceptives-- finally,

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:84%
finally, finally--
that really shows

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're carcinogenic.
LISA GARR: Oh, wow.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.470 align:middle line:84%
That the progestin in them--
this is not progesterone.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It's progestin,
since it's synthetic.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Definitively.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But they give that to young
girls to solve acne problems.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.121 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Oh, right.
Yeah.

00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:10.821 align:middle line:84%
Hey.
How about that?

00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:12.220 align:middle line:84%
-Oh.
-Pretty wacky.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Pretty wacky.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and now-- I
mean, we're just--

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I have such a freedom
to talk with you

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.150 align:middle line:84%
about different things.
HYLA CASS: I know.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I like this.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.340 align:middle line:84%
As we're going into--
OK, I've got to get back

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to the hot flash conversation.
What is that?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.699 align:middle line:90%
What are hot flashes?

00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: So hot flashes
are PMS on steroids,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.207 align:middle line:90%
or without steroids.

00:46:27.207 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:90%
You don't have enough steroids.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.021 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
have hot flashes is your--

00:46:33.021 --> 00:46:35.370 align:middle line:90%
your hormones have gone south.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You're not making
enough progesterone.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.060 align:middle line:84%
You're having
anovulatory cycles, which

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:90%
means no ovulation with age.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You've kind of run out
of-- run out of eggs

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.170 align:middle line:84%
or run out of eggs
that are really

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.980 align:middle line:84%
functioning properly, and
creating a corpus luteum that

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.690 align:middle line:84%
makes progesterone.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
making progesterone.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, it's like
having PMS all month long.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's horrible.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.835 align:middle line:84%
And then what's called
vasomotor instability,

00:47:00.835 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:84%
it means that your blood
rushes to your face,

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and you have flashes and
sweats, and you can't sleep

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:90%
at night, and all of that.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.590 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Usually if you give some
progesterone-- and this

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.900 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone will
often do the trick.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to
add in some estrogen

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and-- for the testosterone.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you
know, before all

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that, I'll often just
start off with using

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.040 align:middle line:84%
a PMS formula or a menopause
formula, or some FemmePhase.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And these are
formulas that are very

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.080 align:middle line:84%
special herbal
formulas, specifically

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.530 align:middle line:90%
for these purposes.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What's in them?
Like an example.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.030 align:middle line:90%
A bunch of Chinese herbs.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unpronounceable
Chinese herbs.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, I
like FemmePhase a lot

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.420 align:middle line:84%
because I've had
a number of women

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.060 align:middle line:90%
who I've given them that first.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no point going
on pharmaceutical hormones.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
The natural hormones are--
still, they're pharmaceutical,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and they're still hormones.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we can avoid
going on hormones,

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.960 align:middle line:84%
like, delay it a little, and use
the natural-- the herbs first.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So what is the difference
between bioidentical hormones

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and the hormone
replacement therapy?

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Actually, some of the hormone
replacement therapy that you

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.930 align:middle line:84%
get from conventional
pharmacies actually is

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.740 align:middle line:84%
pretty, sort of bioidentical.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, Estrace is the
same as estradiol.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
the estriol in it.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm prescribing
hormones for women-- see,

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of things.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I do this psychiatric
part, which is

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.050 align:middle line:90%
the neurotransmitter support.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also dealing
with hormones,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and you can't really--
it's the whole body.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I've got to treat
the whole person.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So you take the--
I check for levels.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can do a saliva test or
a blood test or a urine test

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.580 align:middle line:90%
to check the hormone levels.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And then give these
bioidentical hormones.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
is that they're

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.650 align:middle line:90%
tailored to the individual.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So I look and see
what-- OK, so what's

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.480 align:middle line:84%
the proportion of
the various hormones,

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and how do we replace them?

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you need more progesterone?

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you need more estrogen?

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.810 align:middle line:90%
More testosterone?

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:90%
DHEA.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:90%
That's an adrenal hormone.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So we do all that.
I do that.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I prescribe it.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I can tweak it.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Whereas from the pharmacy,
it's not quite one size

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:84%
fits all, because there
are different dosages.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
made-- for example,

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Biest is made for
estriol and estradiol,

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:90%
two different estrogens.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the
pharmaceutical, regular,

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.310 align:middle line:90%
conventional is just estradiol.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So you deal with hormones and
brain balance and so forth.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the people
that come and see you

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.400 align:middle line:84%
are usually quite
out of balance.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:90%
So how do you deal with that?

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people coming
to you all day long

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.170 align:middle line:90%
that feel like they're crazy.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:40.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Oh, I know.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.815 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that-- it's kind of--

00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You must
have a lot of patience.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Patience and patients.
Yep.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing is
that people feel

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.760 align:middle line:84%
crazy because their
hormones are out of whack,

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.820 align:middle line:84%
their neurotransmitters
are out of whack.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So much is not working.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But the solution can
be fairly simple.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.553 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, that's great.

00:50:00.553 --> 00:50:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looks
like, oh my God.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm a wreck.
What's going to happen?

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that
when you change your diet

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to exercise,
begin to sleep better

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and make a few
tweaks, very often,

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that will just set you
on the path of being OK.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, in "8 Weeks
to Vibrant Health,"

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I put people on this
very-- what I think

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.250 align:middle line:90%
is a very normal program.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Take out the bad stuff,
eat the good stuff,

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.540 align:middle line:90%
do a really simple detox.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be extreme.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get rid of the
bad foods, eat the good foods.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And just-- it really makes an
enormous change very quickly.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.067 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then you add
in various different things.

00:50:40.067 --> 00:50:40.900 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Then I add in.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And I do lab testing.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:90%
That's part of my practice.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'll test for
hormones, I'll test

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.150 align:middle line:84%
for vitamin and mineral levels.
Many things.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll test for heavy metals.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Because boy, that's a
whole other problem.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I also-- what I love about
you is that you really empower

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.540 align:middle line:84%
the patient to be their
own doctor, in a way,

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.600 align:middle line:84%
your own health detective
is what you say.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And you empower people to learn.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
our bodies, and we

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.170 align:middle line:84%
are constantly changing our
chemistry inside of our bodies.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to stay the same.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.292 align:middle line:90%
We wish.

00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:11.125 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to change.

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:12.340 align:middle line:90%
HYLA CASS: Isn't that something?

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we have a
video here with Dr. Cass.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at her in action.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.510 align:middle line:84%
When we have adrenal stress,
one of things that we use

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.370 align:middle line:90%
up a lot are the B vitamins.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:10%
So it's important to have a good
supply of B vitamins, all the B

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.015 align:middle line:10%
vitamins, particularly vitamin
B5, which is pantothenic acid.

00:51:30.015 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:90%
So you want the B vitamins.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Magnesium.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium gets
used up in stress.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.700 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure that
you have 200 to 400 milligrams

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:42.130 align:middle line:84%
daily of magnesium to replenish
what you're losing with stress.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
there are these

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:49.080 align:middle line:84%
wonderful herbal compounds
called adaptogens,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.290 align:middle line:90%
which help us to adapt.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So they support
the adrenal glands.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:10%
There are adaptogens that
are herbal products that

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:10%
come from various traditional
medicines that have been used

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.540 align:middle line:10%
for centuries to help us
restore the adrenal glands,

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.730 align:middle line:10%
to help regulate our adrenal
hormones, our blood pressure,

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:10%
and our feeling of stress.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.060 align:middle line:84%
There's ashwagandha,
which is Ayurvedic.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.620 align:middle line:84%
There's ginseng, which is
generally a Siberian ginseng

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:90%
or eleuthero.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.400 align:middle line:84%
That's most common
one that's used.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Rhodiola root,
also from Siberia.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Mushroom.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Reishi mushroom is
a good adaptogen.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:10%
So all of this adaptogens
are very useful for helping

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.890 align:middle line:10%
to restore adrenal function.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:32.020 align:middle line:10%
So we have that fight or flight
response when we need it.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that,
there's some excellent compounds

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:84%
like phosphatidylserine, which
feeds the brain in handling

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.075 align:middle line:84%
the stress response,
because there's also

00:52:40.075 --> 00:52:42.180 align:middle line:90%
a large mental component to it.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be-- we
want to be in shape.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.750 align:middle line:90%
We want to be mentally in shape.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's meditation,
visualization,

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.380 align:middle line:90%
calming-- the calming response.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.960 align:middle line:90%
We want to do yoga.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.429 align:middle line:84%
Exercise.
Aerobics.

00:52:54.429 --> 00:52:56.230 align:middle line:10%
That's a great stress reliever.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:59.050 align:middle line:10%
You want to take
adaptogens, B vitamins,

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:01.650 align:middle line:10%
along with a multivitamin,
and phosphatidylserine

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.030 align:middle line:10%
and other compounds that
will help feed the brain.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:90%
You have so much information.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:07.890 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: We could
do a lot of shows.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We're drawing so much out
of you today, so thank you.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:90%
So, all right.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:12.751 align:middle line:84%
So we talked a little
bit about-- well,

00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:13.750 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about everything.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about addictions
and adaptogens and adrenals,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid.
Big point.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are under
diagnosed with thyroid issues.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:26.690 align:middle line:84%
How would one know that they
have low or high thyroid?

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So often, women are feeling
tired, cold, can't lose weight.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Their hair's thinning.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.500 align:middle line:90%
The skin's dry.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:90%
They're constipated.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Their eyebrows are thinning.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And they might know even
that it could be thyroid.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And they go to their doctor,
and their doctor does some lab

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.540 align:middle line:90%
tests and says, you're normal.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Old story.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The standards that docs
are using-- if they test it

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.505 align:middle line:84%
all-- they're not
really correct.

00:53:58.505 --> 00:54:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They're using too big a
range of what is normal,

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're allowing people
that really do have-- they

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.390 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, you're borderline.
Let's wait.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:07.390 align:middle line:90%
No, no, you're not borderline.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're borderline,
you're hypothyroid.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's such
good ways to help it.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've had women-- like, just
they were just so grateful.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They said, it's like someone
turned on the lights.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.850 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
diagnosed low thyroid.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I've said, clearly
you're low thyroid.

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Put them on, like, a quarter
of a grain of Nature-Throid,

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:25.660 align:middle line:90%
a half a grain of Nature-Throid.

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Tiny little dose,
and the lights go on.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, they can live.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.059 align:middle line:84%
They can function again.
Yeah.

00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is quite--
if you can't get out

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.850 align:middle line:84%
of bed in the morning, all those
types of things that you just

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.900 align:middle line:84%
think are normal,
everyday stressors

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.924 align:middle line:84%
and that causes stress--
but that's really

00:54:43.924 --> 00:54:44.790 align:middle line:90%
interesting what you said.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So doctors, even if
they do a full panel,

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and even if they put that--

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.666 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: They don't
do a full panel.

00:54:49.666 --> 00:54:50.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:51.496 align:middle line:90%
They don't do the full panel.

00:54:51.496 --> 00:54:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
specifically test for the TSH.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.314 align:middle line:84%
And the range is too big when
they do test for the TSH.

00:54:56.314 --> 00:54:57.990 align:middle line:84%
HYLA CASS: Yeah.
They'll test for TSH.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll grant that.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:02.490 align:middle line:90%
But I don't want a TSH over two.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And in "8 Weeks to
Vibrant Health,"

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I really cover that
very carefully.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:08.577 align:middle line:84%
And also in my "8 Weeks
to Vibrant Health"

00:55:08.577 --> 00:55:09.610 align:middle line:90%
coaching package, I cover that.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
section on thyroid,

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:90%
because it's so, so important.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You want your thyroid,
your TSH, to be under two.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But you also want
to measure free T3

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and free T4 to see
how that's working,

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.290 align:middle line:90%
because T4 converts to T3.

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't get too
technical, but that's

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a way to see what's really
working and what's missing.

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
low in selenium,

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.510 align:middle line:84%
you won't convert T4
to T3, the active form.

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So your whole issue
might be low selenium.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.950 align:middle line:90%
It could be low iodine.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.540 align:middle line:90%
It could be a simple solution.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But your regular doc isn't
going to look for that.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.820 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well,
you also coach us

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:84%
through that in the "8 Weeks
to Vibrant Health" program

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.320 align:middle line:84%
on how to request specific
tests from your doctor.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.250 align:middle line:90%
You can go to a lab anywhere.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.900 align:middle line:84%
You can actually go back
and read through the results

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and compare notes to
the look and say, look.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've discovered.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so empowering.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I did this.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that this is
possible because I did it.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And you told me what to
test for, and I said, look.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:05.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the result. And I
compared it to the charts,

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:06.850 align:middle line:90%
and I went, wow.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I am really low in this.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And you helped me out
in an amazing way.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's empowering
for the patient,

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's relatively easy to do.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And when-- I mean, I did
that probably five years ago,

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and I remember it.

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Because it empowered me.

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah The other
part of low thyroid

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.840 align:middle line:10%
So common.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.720 align:middle line:10%
It's an autoimmune
reaction to your thyroid.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.520 align:middle line:10%
And that-- the root cause, very
often, is gluten sensitivity,

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.630 align:middle line:10%
and that's a whole
other program.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:36.060 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And I
figured that out too.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's another program.

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:39.210 align:middle line:90%
But gluten sensitivity.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.075 align:middle line:84%
We could do five shows
off of all the information

00:56:42.075 --> 00:56:43.170 align:middle line:90%

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.160 align:middle line:90%
