00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered why
walnuts look like a brain?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Or why do carrots, if you cut
them into little tiny circles,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
look like an eye or
kidney beans look

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
like a kidney or even
tomatoes, if you cut them open,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
look like the four
quadrants of the heart?

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think nature
left us these amazing clues?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to
bring this whole food

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
wisdom from ancient
cultures to you.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is health
educator/evangelist Don Tolman,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
who had been known
as the Indiana

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Jones of food and fasting.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.149 align:middle line:84%
He's an absolute
fountain of information.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.481 align:middle line:90%
>> DON TOLMAN: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So we're sitting here
in front of this beautiful food

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.774 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to go
through different systems

00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
in the body and which foods
relate to different systems

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:90%
How did you discover this?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
How did you put together
all of this information?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Just as a young kid
I heard a story about an ancient

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
meal that ancient cultures
thought was sacred and precious

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
to the human body, but no
one knew what the meal was.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They just gave it different
names, like pulse or zeorghim.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras called it
the Meal of Hercules.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
No one really knew what it
was, and that set me on fire.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So I spent 17 years
of my adult life,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
well, when I was young
going into adulthood,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
jumping on trains, working on
freight liners on the oceans.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I went to all seven continents.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I went into ancient collections
that today are mostly

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
under lock and key and lived
amongst 17 different indigenous

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
cultures just asking about all
of these plants and things that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%
could've been this meal.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just came
across so much wisdom

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:90%
from these different cultures.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And they all kind of
felt the exact same way

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
about health and
longevity, and they

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
had principles of
understanding geometries

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:90%
in the form of plants.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was called a
law of similarities,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that a thing like
unto itself is drawn.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And so even though
you can eat a tomato

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and now today's studies show
it's good for your heart,

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
they taught that for
thousands of years.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they felt the tomato
is red, it has four chambers,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's good for the heart.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
A tomato is good for all
the systems of the body,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
but it targets the
heart specifically.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that food that
you're talking about called

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:90%
pulse, what was in it?

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:90%
And you sell that food, right?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You created a package of
it currently, didn't you?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: After 17 years of
looking for it, I finally quit.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
No one had it.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone to the Meyers
Collection, British Museum,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.191 align:middle line:84%
all through Europe to different
continents, Japan, Asia, China,

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:90%
No one knew.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Two years after I
quit, I accidentally

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
stumbled on it by
a billionaire who

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
owns one of the world's
largest collections

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of ancient and arcane
artifacts in Washington, DC,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:90%
just south of Towson.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And I accidentally found it.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So we started making
it as a family

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and giving it to friends.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.839 align:middle line:90%
They went wild.

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so then,
OK, we'll make it available

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to people, so that's
what we've done.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It is one of the most
whole and complete combinations

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
of foods, containing essential
fatty acids, vitamins,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:90%
proteins.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.155 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Everything, yeah.

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I bought it, fed
it to my baby for a while.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.449 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Oh, that's so cool.

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I remember that as
you were talking about it.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: That is awesome.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So these foods here,
we're going to learn about how

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
they relate to different
systems in the body.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.096 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, OK, so seven
systems in the body, right?

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Brain,
skeletal, endocrine.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.416 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
through all of them.

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Som medical groups
break it out into nine.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: But anciently,
they taught there were seven,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
like the seven
continents of the Earth.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:90%
That we're 70% water.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is 70% water.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.249 align:middle line:84%
They felt we were a
microcosm of the Earth.

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's a magical number.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.248 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so they
had seven systems.

00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:15.975 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And I noticed the apple
is pretty much in almost every

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.504 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is.

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why is that?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Anciently,
they taught literally--

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and they tested this, all of
it, over time and distance

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
in the human experience
with consistent result.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of studies
that I have an interest in.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I have no interest
in laboratory studies

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to gain empirical
evidence that has

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.176 align:middle line:84%
been peer-reviewed and typically
bought and paid for up front

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:46.722 align:middle line:84%
by different groups to get the
result they're looking for.

00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Different interests.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And what they found
out over time and distance is

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that the apple is one food that
targets what they call the five

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the human experience.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
You can cut an
apple, and you see

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
a perfect five-pointed star.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, I never
saw that before.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And it's interesting,
you stand up and spread

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
your arms and legs out, you
stand in a five-pointed star.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they had names for
each of the human aspects.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it made it into
the Greco-Roman period,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and so they called it in
that language Citius, Altius,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Fortius, Socius Moneta.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Citius meant swifter mentally.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Altius meant higher emotionally.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.319 align:middle line:84%
Fortius meant
stronger physically.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And they believed
that what gives you

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
legs to stand on and
walk through your life

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.849 align:middle line:84%
and to fulfill yourself
is Socius, Moneta--

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Let me see this.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: --trust
and relationships.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Can you see that,
the five-pointed star?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
That wonderful.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is
almost a part of the apple.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they said an apple

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:90%
a day will keep the doctor away.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course
pharmaceutical medicines

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
today laugh at it
and poke fun of it.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And oh, it's because
apples don't work.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's nonsense.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We've lost the truth.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Around apples.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's said that the walnut
is in the shape of a brain,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.767 align:middle line:84%
and you called that
to my attention.

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a slide here of
what the walnut looks like

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and how it's encased
in the shell.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Why is it said to be
good for the brain?

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because the walnut, the shell,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:90%
is just like the cranial cap.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You break it open,
the walnut looks

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
like it has a left
and right hemisphere,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the upper cerebrums,
lower cerebellums.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It has a convoluted juridic
folds, the wrinkles right

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
on there, just
like the neocortex.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And because it seems
they really work

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
for the brain, what
they've found out

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the
Omega-3's, 6's,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
9's in the oils itself
goes into the brain,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
crosses the blood/brain
barrier, and helps to break down

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
lipofuscin plaque, which leads
to memory loss and memory fog

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and loss of cognitive function.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And now they know
that walnuts really

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
are brain food, just like they
taught in the ancient worlds.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that's the purpose
of those omegas is that it

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.219 align:middle line:84%
makes the kind of fat soluble
and breaks up the plaque

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Brilliant.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.354 align:middle line:90%
Same with the almond?

00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because the
almond is part of the brain.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
They named part of the
brain that looks exactly

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:84%
like almonds the amygdala,
which is Latin for almond.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And now they know that
nutritional components

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of the almond is
used by the cells

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to convert it into
the neurochemistry

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:90%
of emotional processes.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So amygdala and
almond mean the same thing.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
That's not an accident.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
What about the carrots?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier
about how the carrots

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
have a similarity-- we
also have a slide of this,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
if you can't see this here--
of what the eye looks like.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You look at a carrot, and
you look at the whole thing,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and you break it or cut
it, just like you did,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and you see what looks
like a pupil with an iris

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and radiating lines.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people never really
even look into the history.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Why do they call it the
pupil, which means student?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And why do they call it the
iris, which means rainbow?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you get into
this whole thing,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
the optic nerves that

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
go across the ocular
chiasma and go

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
into the visual cortex
and the dendritic branch

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
of that part of the brain.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You didn't
make this up?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: No.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I wish I would've.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.672 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's really creative.

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: But it's fabulous,
because now they know--

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and they tested this
in the modern world--

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
one medium-sized carrot every
single day for seven days

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
increases blood supply
to the eyes by 25%.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
People can restore their
vision with little simple eye

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
exercises they taught anciently
and eating enough carrots

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
They can get rid of contacts
and lenses, if they want to.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And is that the
beta carotene that increases

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:90%
the circulation?

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: That's one thing.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But another thing that
carrots have is the fibers.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
There's over 500 carotenoids
that they have identified.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Beta carotene is one of them.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But the fibers themselves
contain those components,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and they actually clear
the drainage canals

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
from the lens of the
eye that get blocked

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and lead to cataracts
and blurry vision.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it also targets
the drainage canal

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
at the back of the
eye, which causes

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
glaucoma when it's blocked.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And carrots clear it all out.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.809 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, that
makes more sense.

00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So now I can understand
why eating a carrot a day

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:90%
would make a big difference.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It would.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, there's the
recipe that goes along with

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
these food systems,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's in Don's book, "The
Whole Food Medicine Guide."

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is volume three now.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:90%
The other volumes were huge.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: 12 pounds.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: 12 pounds, Yeah.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And in these books are
these beautiful photos

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
of how each one of these
relates to the systems,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and we put it together
for you as well.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.485 align:middle line:90%
But there's a detox.

00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
recipe that goes along

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.897 align:middle line:84%
with each one of the food
systems for the brain

00:10:02.897 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
pulling heavy metals
out of the brain.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.624 align:middle line:84%
You put together
an aluminum detox.

00:10:06.624 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Absolutely.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And in that, let's see,
we've got two cups of grapes,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
one cut apple, and one
cup of strawberries.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We have this for you
guys on the screen here.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Why the fruits?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
What is it, something about
the acids in the fruits?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's so fascinating,
because the fruits themselves,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
all fruits, they
understand today,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
just as it was taught anciently,
their number one target is

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:90%
function of the brain.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the functional
capacity of your brain is what

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
determines all the other
aspects and physiologies

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and anatomy of the body.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
have strawberries

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
that target the
heart and the blood

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and apples that target
the entire body systems

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and you throw in the grapes and
cells and things of the blood,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
it goes through, and
the particles of apples

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
go across the
blood/brain barrier

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and swell up like little
sponges and absorb heavy metals,

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
especially in the basal
ganglia of the brain,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
like aluminum and
lead and mercury,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.175 align:middle line:84%
which can lead to autism
and all kinds of things.

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Parkinson's.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so that helps
to get rid of all of that.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so I read in
your book it's the malic acid

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
in these citrus fruits that
the aluminum binds to and then

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:90%
wicks out of the system.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Another brilliant thing-- OK.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we're on to the
respiratory system.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So these items here are good
for the respiratory system.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:90%
We've got honey.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Why honey?

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Honey is brilliant,
just simply because nothing can

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
live in honey.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Honey won't grow mold.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It never goes bad.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.072 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can happen
to honey is it can dry out.

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Right.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: So you add
water, stir it all up,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
you've got honey again.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And so bacteria, viruses,
molds are done away

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
with when you have
honey in your diet.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say,
oh, it's just bee puke.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They eat flowers,
and they puke it out.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't want-- slow down,
go back to ancient wisdom,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and quit reading
every little editorial

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that somebody's paid for
to write to make money.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is there something in
the honey that's specifically

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:90%
good for the lungs?

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because it is literally from

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.065 align:middle line:84%
thousands of
blossoms of flowers.

00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so it's
bringing pollens and all kinds

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of nutritional components that
they haven't even been able

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:90%
to name all of it yet.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And the lungs are so
affected by the air

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and the pollens and
different things

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that when you take that in in
that form it goes to the lungs

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and protects the lungs
themselves, the bronchioles

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.212 align:middle line:84%
and everything so that you
don't have those problems.

00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It works as a natural
antihistamine if you take it

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.135 align:middle line:84%
from the local area
that you live in.

00:12:54.135 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It really is.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.519 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Fascinating.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
What about the artichoke?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Why is that good for the lungs?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.635 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because a lot of times people

00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:84%
will start to cough and hack
and feel like they're choking,

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:90%
arti-choke.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And you can go back
into the history of this thing,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
which I know we don't
have full time for here--

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Well, go ahead.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.769 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about it.

00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: The arterial flow and
the blood flow into the lungs

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:90%
sometimes constrict.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so it's not
getting the full blood/gas,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.235 align:middle line:84%
you know, enhancement that
it needs and dissipating

00:13:28.235 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of
gases that are spent.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And the artichoke has whatever
the nutritional components

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.114 align:middle line:84%
are to be able to break all of
that up and to clear the lung.

00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Does it having anything
to do with also the heart

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:90%
that's inside it?

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: I think
absolutely so.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
artichoke heart gets

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.269 align:middle line:84%
to the heart of the problem
that the lungs sometimes suffer.

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That would make sense.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:90%
And now red potatoes.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:84%
You're a big fan of red potatoes
and the whole potato too.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.227 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: I am.

00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:57.976 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Skin too.

00:13:57.976 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And the
reason that I am,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
it actually has a signature
pattern of the lung.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And you slice them up into
little cookie-like things,

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
you squeeze lemon juice on it,
put some good nature-made salt,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and you eat them uncooked,
and they target the lungs.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've had six people in
Western Australia whose lungs

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
were filled with asbestos and
some of them from other things

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.424 align:middle line:84%
from the mining
industry, told they

00:14:25.424 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
were going to have
to get on iron lungs,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:90%
do all this kind of stuff.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
They instead put it
off, went with large red

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.585 align:middle line:84%
skinned potatoes, the
lemon juice and salt.

00:14:35.585 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.349 align:middle line:84%
Within three to four months,
every single one of them

00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it was all cleared and
out of their bodies,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and they're just fine.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You're kidding.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
How many times a day
do you suggest that?

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.595 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is brilliant.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have a red skin potato
about the size of the fist,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:90%
that's all you need each day.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, just
one full potato,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:90%
and you eat slices of that.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.852 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And you're targeting
the cleansing of the lung.

00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That is fascinating.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
We actually have that
recipe for you guys

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, "1 Potato, 2
Potato, 3 Potato, 4."

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
That is great, because
the recent cold and flu

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
season has brought on so many
respiratory issues and lung

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.666 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:15.604 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that can actually
get rid of pus in the lungs.

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Absolutely.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And we've had hundreds and
hundreds of people try it,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:90%
and they're blown away.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.454 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now what
about rosemary?

00:15:23.454 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Why is rosemary good
for-- I love this.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can see this, this
particular piece of rosemary,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.315 align:middle line:84%
which is from my garden,
is in the shape of a heart.

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It just happened
to be like that.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Just picked that way.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: My daughter picked it.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Wow.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.196 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that neat?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So why is rosemary
good for the lungs?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It's fascinating.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Take that and just crush
the needles and smell.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.387 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Isn't that something?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It smells like pizza.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: There you go.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:90%
No, it's so fascinating.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
That effluvial molecule
that is part of the essence

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and the oils of that rosemary
again helps to clear the lungs.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just like when
people breathe peppermint.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Boy, they can feel
it just hit the brain

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and go to the lungs
and everything.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Rosemary has a
concentration of components

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that will clear the
lungs and actually goes

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and targets the process
of memory in the brain.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the things
that they've studied,

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that the lungs and the brain
are directly connected.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can stop
and hold your breath,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
but you can think,
OK, don't breathe.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can only go so
long, and then your brain

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.296 align:middle line:90%
says, you better breathe.

00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.704 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: But rosemary targets
the brain and the lungs.

00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant stuff.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.421 align:middle line:84%
And especially the oils
of it, oils of rosemary,

00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
oils of peppermint, and
all that you talk about,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.231 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful oils
in these leaves.

00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So we could sprinkle the
rosemary on the potatoes

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.616 align:middle line:84%
also with the sea salt, and
that would be pretty good too.

00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The next system we're
talking about is the heart.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Now the beet.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's start off with the beet.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Why is the beet
good for the heart?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: A lot of people don't
even realize why we call it

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:90%
the beet.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's because you
have a heartbeat.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
shape of the heart,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
and it targets the rhythmatic
function of the heart itself.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
It actually helps to
overcome arrhythmias,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of mess-ups in
the function of rhythm

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:90%
of the heartbeat.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
You look at this thing, you
start to look at the leaves,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it's arteries
filled with blood that goes off

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
into veins, capillaries,
the whole thing.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
This plant right here,
including the greens,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best
heart blood foods

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can ever
have in your diet.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: The components
in this thin the blood.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you have high
blood pressure,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
it helps to drop that pressure.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.251 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thins the blood.

00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It gets rid of plaque
and fats and crap that get

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream, if you
live in a developed country

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:90%
with processed foods.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It targets nutritionally
the blood cells themselves.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It has a perfect balance
of iron and magnesium

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and all the other things
that people want to name.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But there again,
they know there's

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
a little over 11,000
nutritional components in this.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Why do you think it
has such a high sugar content?

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Beet sugar is great for
sweetening things, making

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.577 align:middle line:90%
cake red, if you want.

00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:25.076 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of sugar
is large molecules

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of sugar, which is what
the brain works on,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the adrenals work.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And the pancreas uses that
sugar to produce glucagon

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that is stored in
the adrenals that

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.519 align:middle line:84%
is turned into adrenalin
for body function.

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So beet sugar is
actually good for us.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It absolutely is.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've also noticed
that the red beets,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
if you eat a lot of red
beets, that they come out

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
in the eliminatory
systems as well.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're are very,
very pure food.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.405 align:middle line:90%
No food dye here.

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: They are.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.141 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.805 align:middle line:84%
So also for the heart is
you recommend grapefruits.

00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And why grapefruits?

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Well, they tested
this for me at Cornell Medical.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: From our
neighbor's tree.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: This is beautiful.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have clogged arteries
or are concerned about it--

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
we have had patients scheduled
for triple and quadruple bypass

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
surgery to get rid of
their blocked arteries.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they put the surgery
off, they stop all medications,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:84%
if they have enough
courage and will,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and they eat three of
these every morning.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of the
patients that have been tested

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
have absolutely clear
arteries within anywhere

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
from 45 days to
90 days, and they

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:90%
don't need surgery whatsoever.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the acid in here that
breaks up plaque in the body.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So is that why the
famous grapefruit diet was

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.587 align:middle line:84%
so popular, because the acid
actually breaks up fat as well?

00:20:00.587 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: And it's interesting.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you can put
grapefruit juice in the jar,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
dump in a half a cup of, say,
virgin olive oil, shake it up,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and it stays in solution.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Oil floats to the
top in every liquid,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.729 align:middle line:90%
but it will stay in solution.

00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Seriously?

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And it
breaks up fats.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That is great to know.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.389 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:25.389 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And then also we talked earlier
about the heart, the tomato.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have actually
a picture here

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.254 align:middle line:84%
of how tomato when you
cut it-- and I'm not

00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:84%
going to cut it
here, because it's

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
going to go all over the
place-- looks like-- that's

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
why we have the picture-- the
four quadrants of the heart.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.675 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No mystery there.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: No, none.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting,
because they've

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
known tomatoes were heart
fooDs for thousands of years.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And even the American
Heart Association's website

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
openly admits tomatoes
are heart food.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And they say that the
number one component that's

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
so good for the heart
is that it has lycopene.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
That's just a Latin
word that means red.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But it sure sounds
like they're experts.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, now they powder lycopene,
and they put it in supplements.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: But eat
the tomato instead.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to get lycopene
or red stuff in a capsule.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Just eat the tomato.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Eat the tomato.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.564 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about tomatoes being
a part of the nightshade family

00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and it carrying
the funguses and--

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.813 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:21:28.813 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Every writer out there
is bought and paid for

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to write nasty stuff
about every whole food,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and instead you should
be on this medication

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
or this supplement
pill or this capsule.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all so much better.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
This is deadly and dangerous.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And yet I have fed
tomatoes to a one-year-old,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and they absolutely loved
it, my own children,

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're still alive
today and functioning.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of
anybody that died

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:90%
from the nightshade of a tomato.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, individual
bodies might be different.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.957 align:middle line:90%
But to each his own.

00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:04.456 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:04.955 align:middle line:90%
Spinach.

00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Spinach also great
for the heart.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Spinach has got a lot
of great things for it.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I notice it's in a lot of the
different systems' food lists.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as you
look at these things

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and just take a look at the
patterns of arteries and veins,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and then you start getting
into the power of these things,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
there again it's going right to
the power of the heart muscle

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and targeting that blood
supply into all of the muscles

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and moving through the body.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now are you OK
with breaking these down,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:90%
juicing them?

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Or are they better eaten
whole in your opinion?

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: In the ancient
world, the healers,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
not the pharmakeia, which
means poison-makers--

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
there's always been two
groups, all the way back

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to the earliest
dynasties of Egypt.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
There were the poison-makers
and the healers.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because the healers knew

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to health
and healing and longevity

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and even when you're
sick or injured,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
there are three ways to heal
and bring yourself back.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
There is fast,
faster, and fastest.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
The fast path-- and fast
means to strengthen.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Lot of people think it
means to starve to death.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But it means to
strengthen, to hold fast,

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to hold firm and strong-- a
fast way to return to health

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:90%
is to simply eat it and chew it.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
A faster way is to
juice it and leave

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.762 align:middle line:84%
the fibers and
things in the juice.

00:23:44.762 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And the fastest is
to remove the fibers

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and go with the aqueous or
the aquarian, the liquid part.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Just the juice.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: That's
the fastest healing.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: So faster
is with the fibers.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Fast is simply eat it.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But cooking it I noticed was
not in your formula there.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Right.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.464 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So mostly raw.

00:24:08.464 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And there again I think
it's very, very important

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that people understand where the
word raw originally came from.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I agree with a Ra
diet spelled R-A,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
not R-A-W. R-A-W came in the
late 1600s and into the 1700s.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And raw, R-A-W, was simply
the reverse spelling of war.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Getting rid of chaos and a
house divided against itself

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:84%
was to eat an uncooked
diet for recovery.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The original Ra diet,
R-A, which the healers

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
embraced, and then an
uncooked for recovery periods,

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the Ra was the
spelling of the sun.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cultures
called that Ra.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so it meant to
eat foods in the season that

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
they come forward in the
temperate zone where you live.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And so certain foods like
berries and asparagus

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and things come
up in the spring,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and then it shifts over
to things like melons.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
The water content just goes
right through the roof.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Melons have around
90% to 93% water.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:90%
The brain is 90% to 93% water.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So you thump the old melon,
and that's what they knew.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
They knew melons
targeted brain function.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And so then you
go into the fall.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.520 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
fall, or autumn,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:84%
but fall because the water
content was going down.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And so as it's going
down, there are even

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
some fruits like apples and
things that you could cook,

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and it would not create
war or chaos in the body.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the beans and legumes,
the hard squash, the pumpkins,

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
the tubers from under the
ground, like garlic and onions,

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
you could cook those
or eat them uncooked,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.415 align:middle line:84%
but it would not create
chaos or war in the body.

00:26:04.415 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Now wasn't food
originally called

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
medicine, certain
foods as medicine?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the name of your
book, "Whole Food Medicines."

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: All of the foods
were nature's medicines designed

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.730 align:middle line:90%
for human beings.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And they took the
most precious foods

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that they had tested over time
and distance in every culture.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And when visitors would
come in boats and things,

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
they would take the
seeds and gift it to them

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:84%
to take to their country so
they would have that medicine.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the most common
foods are the most precious

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and profound of foods.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And they get bashed
all the time.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You should only
have a superfood.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:90%
That stuff makes me sick.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
These common foods were
based on common sense that

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.760 align:middle line:84%
were commonly good
for the people.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And it created the commonwealth
of those societies,

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
because they
believed the greatest

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:90%
wealth was your health.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
all that came from.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So when foods were
traded for the benefits

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of spices and so forth, it
was for people's health,

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they had
certain value levels.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So back to the systems, this
is the endocrine system.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And these are foods that are
good for the endocrine system.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I learned something
about mushrooms.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I did not know they were
very high in iodine.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: They are the highest
concentration of iodine of any

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
plant on the face of the Earth,
even more so than sea kelp.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And why do you think
that the Western world is

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:90%
so deficient in iodine?

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Why such a rampant increase
of thyroid disease?

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.681 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.783 align:middle line:90%
I've unleashed the cowboy.

00:27:50.783 --> 00:27:53.241 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: (SOUTHERN ACCENT)
I'll try to hold back a little

00:27:53.241 --> 00:27:54.615 align:middle line:90%
bit, m'kay, little lady?

00:27:54.615 --> 00:27:55.865 align:middle line:90%
(NORMAL VOICE) But here it is.

00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
When someone feels tired,
they feel fatigued,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:84%
they feel a mental fog, they
might even feel a little dizzy,

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
those are symptoms of
over 1,000 diseases

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that people have
those same symptoms.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So people run to
the doctor and want

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to be tested and given an
answer as to what it is.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And the money-making is
so behind all of this,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's so easy for the
CEOs of the companies that

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
make drugs to
target the thyroid.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Their job is to market and
sell and to get that out there.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.840 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It's their company.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.670 align:middle line:90%
That's their business.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
have a thyroid problem,

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:90%
just go be tested.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll be hyper or hypo
or they'll find something

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
else wrong to get you on drugs.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:90%
That's their business.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
these mushrooms

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is that when you look
at them and you get rid

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of that little stem and
open the thing up and see

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.341 align:middle line:84%
those structures
in there, and then

00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
you can get "Grey's Anatomy"
and start looking at the tissue

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
structures of the
thyroid, that was

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of the thyroid in
the ancient healers' minds.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's so interesting.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:22.522 align:middle line:84%
We have had people on drugs
for thyroidism, hyper and hypo.

00:29:22.522 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:90%
They get rid of the medicine.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:90%
They stop.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:90%
They start eating those.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.909 align:middle line:84%
90 days later, they go back
to the doctor to be tested.

00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked them,
if the doctor asks you

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.408 align:middle line:84%
if you've been on your
medicine, just say

00:29:34.408 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
yes and see what happens.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.821 align:middle line:90%
And just be tested.

00:29:36.821 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
and say, oh, man,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:90%
the medicine's really working.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:90%
You're really good.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And so then they
come back and smile

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:90%
and stay with their mushrooms.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
We have had six people have
their thyroid surgically

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
removed after being on thyroid
medication five to seven years.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.999 align:middle line:90%
And they stop the medication.

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They're told they've got to be
on it the rest of their lives.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:90%
They stop.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
They eat one cup of mushrooms,
cooked, steamed, sauteed.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Doesn't matter.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Every one of them
have had their thyroids grow

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.521 align:middle line:84%
back in 9 to 15 months,
and it's fully functional.

00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And how many of these
do you eat a day?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: One cup full.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: One cup full.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter if they're
cooked, sauteed, whatever.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.573 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: No.

00:30:17.573 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the foods
that it's OK to steam.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:90%
It will not create chaos.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It won't create
chaos in the food.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Endocrine system.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:90%
The beautiful avocado.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I love avocados.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:90%
They are a gorgeous food.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Why are they great for
the endocrine system?

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because the similarities,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the law of similarities
or doctrine of signatures,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
the sign of natures-- and I've
been barking this for 40 years.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a lone
wolf for a long time.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to see other
people getting into it,

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and I love the
fact that you are.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The avocado, they
believed, looked

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
like the womb and the
cervix of the female.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And it has one
swollen seed, just

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
like a woman who is pregnant.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they had women,
especially in ancient Greece,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:84%
eat three of those a week
throughout the pregnancy.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They've tested this today in
two different medical clinics.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They know that if a woman
will eat two or three avocados

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:84%
a week during pregnancy
and even after she'll

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.656 align:middle line:84%
shed the unwanted
weight gain fast.

00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And they know that it
also somehow helps overcome any

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.136 align:middle line:90%
complications in delivery.

00:31:22.136 --> 00:31:22.802 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:31:22.802 --> 00:31:23.552 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Uh-huh.

00:31:23.552 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It can actually help
to prevent and even

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:90%
help to clear cervical cancers.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It has the good fats.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It has so many things in it.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And it takes nine months to
grow an avocado from blossom

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:90%
to ripened fruit.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Nine months.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.976 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Who
made this stuff up?

00:31:40.976 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Nine months.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Perfect.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.596 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about
our friend the kiwi?

00:31:44.596 --> 00:31:46.944 align:middle line:84%
Why is the kiwi good
for an endocrine system?

00:31:46.944 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because this particular fruit

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
here they believed really
targeted the male testicles

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and even the motility of
the sperm and even volume

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.090 align:middle line:90%
of the sperm.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
fascinating, because there

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
are some studies
now that shows it's

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:84%
good for different
things in the body.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.585 align:middle line:84%
But it really does target
the testicular system.

00:32:13.585 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.959 align:middle line:90%
And it's high in vitamin C.

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Awesome.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is it high in
zinc or anything else?

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Well, here's the
thing that people I think need

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to start to understand.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Every food on
this earth has every known

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
nutritional
component, all of it.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It just has them in different
volumes of concentration.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It has it all.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:90%
This has iron.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:90%
This has iron.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:90%
This has iron.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.407 align:middle line:90%
This has iron.

00:32:43.407 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And so people sit there and they
say, well, does it have zinc?

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Does it have-- it's
got everything.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I have lived in cultures
where they actually

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:90%
lived for months off one food.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now I know you've
lived for months with no food.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: True.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
You've gone on complete
fasts for 40 days at a time?

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Uh-huh.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I went 90 days on
watermelon juice five times.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I've gone 40 days on
nothing but water.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Five times
on watermelon juice.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And you got
everything you needed?

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
whenever you fast,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a juice
fast or a water fast,

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
the first three days
are the hardest.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.120 align:middle line:90%
It's harder than day 35 and 36.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But you get through that,
the metabolic process

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:43.040 align:middle line:84%
of just dumping and clearing
and not habituated force feeding

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
your face and all that, and it's
just fascinating how you feel

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:84%
mentally and emotionally,
physically, even

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.700 align:middle line:90%
within your own personality.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so your social
relationships, very thrilling.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: There's a very, very
big mental aspect to cleansing

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.010 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: There is.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You go through a lot
of cleansing of mental thoughts

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and old thoughts that
don't work any longer.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of shadow
stuff comes up

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.564 align:middle line:84%
as it's coming out and
purging itself as well.

00:34:11.564 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Sure.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Been through it.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.680 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Eliminatory system.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why these
wonderful foods

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
are great for the
eliminatory system.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way I
wanted to mention

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
we have a recipe for the
blood sugar balancing.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:90%
And this is really great.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This is going to come up
on your screen in a second.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a blood sugar balancer.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And all that's in it, let's
see, you've got pure water,

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
small apple, nutritional
yeast, two tablespoons

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of oats, wheat germ, sunflower
seeds, and orange juice.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.057 align:middle line:84%
And that's great for
balancing blood sugar.

00:34:43.057 --> 00:34:43.765 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:34:43.765 --> 00:34:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's a
wonderful combination.

00:34:45.598 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Why that combination of foods?

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's interesting,
because if you really dig

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
into the measures of the
glycemic index and everything

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that's going on, people need to
slow down a little bit and not

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
be afraid.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
set of foods actually

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
target all of the
systems that direct right

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:90%
to the pancreatic function.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And that pancreas will begin
to produce more glucagon, which

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.175 align:middle line:84%
gives you your energy back,
drops the glycemic index,

00:35:19.175 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:90%
and just restores function.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And we could go off
for an hour on that.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But just keeping it
cut to the chase,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.132 align:middle line:84%
people can test
this for themselves.

00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I like.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Test it yourself,
find the result that you get,

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and there you have it.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so the oats and
the nutritional yeast help kind

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.194 align:middle line:84%
of balance out the sugars in
the fruits and creates that same

00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:45.360 align:middle line:90%
type of balance in the body?

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it helps to clear out toxic
residues of refined sugars,

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
synthetic sweeteners, like
aspartame and things like that.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:84%
It goes and clears that
and then restores function.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then also has a
certain amount of protein in it

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.615 align:middle line:84%
that'll help balance
the blood sugar as well.

00:36:02.615 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yep.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
I learned that from your book.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Awesome.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.171 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:36:06.171 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Going to the eliminatory system,
cucumber, high water content,

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.997 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why this is good
for the eliminatory.

00:36:12.997 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: You probably
have heard the phrase cool

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:90%
as a cucumber.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: That food helps
to cleanse and to clean out

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:28.730 align:middle line:84%
the eliminatory system, which
restores the neuroendocrine

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:90%
function, immunity.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is that
it takes out they heat

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:84%
process the body has to
create to stay on top

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of inflammation,
infection, bacterial overwhelm.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what fevers do.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Fevers are there to heal
you, not to kill you.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They're there to heal.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.705 align:middle line:84%
And so if you feel like
you're getting too hot

00:36:53.705 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
or you're having these flushes
of just heat and everything,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that there is going to
clear everything out

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that the body is trying
to protect you from.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.526 align:middle line:84%
That clears it, and so
the temperature drops.

00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's also great to
put little circles underneath

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:90%
your eyes.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.856 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: True.

00:37:08.856 --> 00:37:10.442 align:middle line:90%
And I got to start doing that.

00:37:10.442 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why is that?

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Black pepper.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know black pepper was
great for eliminatory systems.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.776 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why is that?

00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: If you'll
use black pepper--

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
don't put it into foods
that you're cooking.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Wait till the cooking is done.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Then put it on.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Because if you do, it
does deactivate the stimulation

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.230 align:middle line:84%
of the peristaltic
action of the intestines.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.055 align:middle line:84%
It speeds up that action
of the intestines.

00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, it does?

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Finely ground.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course,
the peppercorns.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So more finely ground?

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And it
stimulates peristalsis.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I did not know that.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.871 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:90%
What about flaxseed?

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.104 align:middle line:84%
This is another great one
for the eliminatory system.

00:37:50.104 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.635 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We have finely
ground flax here.

00:37:52.635 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: The fibers and
the oils in the flaxseed goes

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:84%
through, and it'll get
stuck on the mucosal lining

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of the alimentary canal, the
entire intestinal system,

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and it will swell up
as it absorbs liquids.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it'll help slough
off the mucosal lining

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:90%
and get it out of the body.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The intestinal mucosal
lining is supposed

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to replace itself
every 3 to 5 days.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They know that the
average US citizen, it

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:84%
replaces anywhere from
30 days to 4 months,

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and that is not healthy.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why most disease
symptoms actually

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
start from the intestines
being blocked, clogged,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.841 align:middle line:90%
dry, the whole thing.

00:38:35.841 --> 00:38:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: From the colon.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course, colon disease.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And that's
what those things do.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:42.860 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So it takes the toxins
out of the mucoid plaque

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:90%
layer of the intestinal system.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.443 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's brilliant.

00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We also have here lentils,
wonderful lentils.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Why are these good
for eliminatory?

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's so fascinating,
because the lentils themselves

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
have a concentration
on a type of protein.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
200,000 identifiable proteins,

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and they break them out
into groupings from hormones

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to enzymes, and it just
goes down the list.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This particular
seed has a protein

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.836 align:middle line:84%
that strengthens the
actual colonic wall.

00:39:22.836 --> 00:39:24.025 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, it does?

00:39:24.025 --> 00:39:24.816 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It does.

00:39:24.816 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And the small intestines.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It strengthens the actual
interstitial muscular tissue

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And so because that
is strengthened,

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't develop bursts
or balloons or polyps

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
or other things, and it
keeps it healthy and strong.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that is a
good food to have.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So the proteins
in the lentils do this.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: They do.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.159 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also the kidney that

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.790 align:middle line:84%
is associated with the
eliminatory system.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a slide
here of the kidney.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Why do kidney beans
look like kidneys?

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Why do they call
them kidney beans?

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.291 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Exactly.

00:40:00.291 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because they
look like kidneys.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.188 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And it's
so interesting,

00:40:04.188 --> 00:40:11.300 align:middle line:84%
any bean or legume or even
some of the lentil groupings,

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:84%
anything that looks
like the kidneys,

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going to target
that kidney function.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've had so many people
restore their kidney function

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
just by having a
crock pot and filling

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:84%
it, slow, slow, slow
cooking, and throwing

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.004 align:middle line:84%
in a little garlic and onion and
having a bowl of that each day.

00:40:29.004 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Then
putting it in water?

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: And then it goes.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You're kidding.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.916 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Just putting the water
in, slow cooking it.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You can sprout them and eat
them, if you're up to that.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient wisdom shows
that's not actually necessary.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about the idea
that beans could cause gas

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:90%
in certain systems and so forth?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
you've been asked before?

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: The healthiest,
healthiest people create more

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:90%
gas than others.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Cows, very healthy, they create
a lot of gas, and, of course,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.230 align:middle line:90%
global warming.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
total nonsense.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But believe whatever
you want to believe.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But that's why a
lot of vegetarians

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
actually have more
flatulence than meat-eaters.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's because those gases
is nitrogen gas and then

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.750 align:middle line:84%
converting into methane
and other gases,

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and it clears and keeps
the metabolic process

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of the body healthy
and fully functional.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: How?

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: It's the breakdown
of the proteins and so the body

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:90%
can actually use the proteins.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
you pop your knuckles.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's nitrogen
gas being released.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
when chiropractors,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
if they're not invasive and
know what they're doing,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
it can be very, very
beneficial and healing.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And the popping sounds
is the gases escaping.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:59.560 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, they can calcify,
and now you've got problems.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the gases from beans and
lentils and things like that

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is actually a very
healthy thing.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But can
be uncomfortable.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Sure.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you get bloated
and blah, blah, blah, then

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
you need to eat the kinds of
foods and drink enough water

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and go walking for an
hour, and so everything

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:90%
is functioning properly.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Can move.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a great
recipe that you

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.520 align:middle line:84%
have here for a
kidney stone cleanse.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And people that have
had kidney stones

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and been through the pain of the
process of the stones passing

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.850 align:middle line:90%
would love to see this recipe.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you recommend doing?

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.665 align:middle line:84%
We've got a quart of tomato
juice, a quart of sauerkraut,

00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:40.624 align:middle line:90%
and 12 drops of peppermint oil.

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:44.051 align:middle line:84%
And when it's the sauerkraut,
it's just the liquid.

00:42:44.051 --> 00:42:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: You strain the
sauerkraut off the cabbage,

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and you just have the liquid,
and then you put in the drops

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the peppermint.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Peppermint oil.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And you drink this?

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: You shake it all
up, and you drink it one to two

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:90%
hours before you go to bed.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Don't move around once
you've drunk that.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.380 align:middle line:84%
You need to calm down, lay
down, and then go to bed.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning you will
pass those kidney stones.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've had hundreds and
hundreds of people do this.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But they break
the stones up to a finer--

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.548 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It breaks them up.

00:43:18.548 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Also, it'll help to get rid of
the pain as it's coming out.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because they're more
of a fine ground-up type.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not big stones
that are being passed.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Right.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Does it have something
to do with the cultured enzymes

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:90%
in the sauerkraut?

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: I think it's that
as well as the salt brine

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.385 align:middle line:84%
absorbing all of that
intestinal component.

00:43:40.385 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.759 align:middle line:84%
And then the cleansing of the
tomato and the peppermint oil,

00:43:43.759 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
you also mentioned, has a
wicking type of element to it.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Peppermint oil as well?

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah, it does.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Fascinating.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Boy, you
know your stuff.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.942 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I love it.

00:43:54.942 --> 00:43:56.025 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I read your book.

00:43:56.025 --> 00:43:56.691 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:57.212 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:43:57.212 --> 00:43:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You just said it--

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: That's so awesome.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --so I'm listening.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I'm just
a good listener.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:01.779 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:01.779 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So lymphatic system.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I had so much fun putting
all this together.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So immune and lymphatic system.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:90%
We've got the tangerine.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.805 align:middle line:84%
Why is that good for
the immune system?

00:44:11.805 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I might kind of figure it out.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:90%
But they're good in winter.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:14.933 align:middle line:90%
They grow in winter.

00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
because every food anciently

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.940 align:middle line:84%
had either a feminine
or a masculine signature

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:90%
or both to the ancient healers.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And they believed
that each of us

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is created both male
and female, that we

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.560 align:middle line:84%
have feminine qualities, we
have masculine qualities.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the citrus they
believed was feminine.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, OK.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Are you staying
abreast of what I'm talking

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.824 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:44:41.824 --> 00:44:42.365 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:44:42.365 --> 00:44:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And it's interesting,
if you cut this and look at it,

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the cells of this thing look
like the cells of the mammary

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.725 align:middle line:90%
glands in the breast.

00:44:52.725 --> 00:44:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Huh.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And then you go even
into other structures and you

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
find, oh my gosh, the
neuroimmune system is

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.050 align:middle line:84%
a replication of the brain cells
that float throughout the body

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and send signals back to the
brain of the condition all

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.810 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Like sonar.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the cells in
all of the citrus

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.970 align:middle line:84%
target the neuroimmune system
and the lymphatic clearing,

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.330 align:middle line:84%
which is what keeps
you healthy and going.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So any toxicities
it helps to clear.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And the nutritional
components of these

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.390 align:middle line:84%
actually help to
overcome deficiencies

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:35.730 align:middle line:90%
within that system.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.305 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then also with the
green onions and the garlic?

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yes.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I know garlic's a
great antifungal, antibacterial.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TOLMAN: You nailed it.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.274 align:middle line:90%
And same here.

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:44.773 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Same with
the green onions?

00:45:44.773 --> 00:45:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Absolutely.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've had people
with nasal blockage and lung

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.910 align:middle line:90%
congestion.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can cut these onions
and just slightly put it up

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.317 align:middle line:84%
into your nostril and--
[INHALES STRONGLY]

00:45:59.317 --> 00:46:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, really?

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And then--
[EXHALES STRONGLY] You know?

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And go back and forth.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's so fascinating
how it helps

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to clear and to
heal all of that.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I also understand that
if you plant green onions next

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to lettuce that it will work
as a natural pesticide and keep

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.280 align:middle line:90%
certain bugs away from--

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: 100%.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --eating your lettuce.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Really good to know.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is so cool.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:23.863 align:middle line:84%
There's a great recipe

We've got it on the
screen here for you.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It's "The Hulk," orange juice,
pecans, wheatgrass juice,

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:84%
sesame seeds, flaxseed

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.252 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What an
incredible combination.

00:46:38.252 --> 00:46:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: I love
that combination,

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and especially the berries.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't even know what
the Latin word for berry is.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's vaccinium.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what berry came from
in the Latin, vaccinium.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the poison-makers
took that word

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and called it vaccine
and vaccinate.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The original vaccines,
the protector inhibitors

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of the cultures, were berries.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.220 align:middle line:84%
If you want to vaccinate
yourself from everything,

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.430 align:middle line:84%
eat berries when
they're in season.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:08.681 align:middle line:90%
Just pig out on them.

raspberries, strawberries,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.390 align:middle line:90%
whenever they're in season.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:12.348 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: All of them.

00:47:12.348 --> 00:47:14.296 align:middle line:90%
They are nature's vaccines.

00:47:14.296 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And they've got a
bunch of antioxidants as well.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.800 align:middle line:84%
That has been discovered,
of course, since.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:90%
All right.

It's good for it all.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:36.631 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Which you
mentioned earlier.

00:47:36.631 --> 00:47:40.642 align:middle line:84%
So my question was, how do
you get protein in your diet?

00:47:40.642 --> 00:47:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Is there protein in spinach?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: I think so.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.040 align:middle line:90%

200,000 identifiable proteins.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:02.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, grass, just wild
grass, has all of the proteins.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why horses and
cows and oxen and buffaloes

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.215 align:middle line:84%
and elephants, where do
they get their protein?

00:48:09.215 --> 00:48:12.325 align:middle line:84%
All they eat is grass
and drink water.

00:48:12.325 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.905 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: They get it all.

00:48:13.905 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%

Totally.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a
greater concentration

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:25.330 align:middle line:84%
of muscle-building protein in
grass than any other plant.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I love the
smell of sprouts.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.156 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And the sprouts
are so fascinating,

00:48:51.156 --> 00:48:54.000 align:middle line:84%
because they're already so
activated it's almost like

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.370 align:middle line:90%

>> TOLMAN: And it's
so interesting,

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
because they've
studied eggs now,

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and they realized that eggs
actually target the bloodstream

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.094 align:middle line:84%
in a way that it doesn't
allow for blood clotting.

00:50:01.094 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And so it can
help to avoid blood clotting.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It helps to avoid
strokes, things like that.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people get
angry about eating eggs.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They think it's
killing a chicken.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.220 align:middle line:90%
But you're not.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:84%
You could set this
out on the grass

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.150 align:middle line:90%
and just try to sneak up on it.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.686 align:middle line:84%
It won't run, and it
won't even fly away.

00:50:25.686 --> 00:50:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it's not a chicken
yet is what you're saying.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.150 align:middle line:84%

amongst them--

00:50:36.494 --> 00:50:39.560 align:middle line:84%
they believe that if a
young girl has a period,

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:84%
she killed a baby, and that's
why you should get little girls

pregnant before they
even start their period.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.932 align:middle line:84%
And they throw
that onto eggs too.

>> LISA: All right.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So now the last one

that we're going to cover here.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And this we have the jicama.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.957 align:middle line:84%
Why is that great for--
it looks like a bone.

00:51:01.957 --> 00:51:03.040 align:middle line:90%

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It could look like a
bone inside of a jicama, yeah.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.432 align:middle line:90%
And this is such a good food.

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And it has, just like celery,
that looks like a bone,

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:21.340 align:middle line:84%
snaps like a bone, these foods

sodium.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's the sodium

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.930 align:middle line:84%
in good nature-made salt
that ionizes in the body

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:32.030 align:middle line:90%
into calcium.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Your body makes calcium
for your bones from salt.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:84%

Parkinson's and so forth?

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Could this help decalcify with

hexachromium, titanium powders.

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, if they throw
all of that in pancake mix

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:28.415 align:middle line:84%
or white flour breads, it
even has ground up asbestos.

00:52:28.415 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Would do
see aluminum powder--

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Melamine.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Aluminum powder
is truly the heavy metal

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.780 align:middle line:90%
of aluminum ground up, so it--

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --creates
an anti-caking.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And they
throw it into salt.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.992 align:middle line:84%
You go into a restaurant,
most of them have--

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's in ingredients.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: --the
commercial salt.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:90%
It's right in there.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.595 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, one cool thing
is you're not going to find

00:52:47.595 --> 00:52:49.480 align:middle line:84%
aluminum powder in these
things, which are--

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.671 align:middle line:84%
we have a combination here of
pistachios and pumpkin seeds.

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what I have in my hand.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So these are great for
the skeletal system.

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: They are.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I'm not a
hand model, by the way.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying today.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.735 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yes, you are.

00:53:04.735 --> 00:53:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: No, it's
really interesting,

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because that combination
of nutritional components,

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.120 align:middle line:84%
it's been studied
even in today's world.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And they just simply confirm
what the ancient healers

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.430 align:middle line:90%
had tested and known.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're absolutely
good for the bones.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And the pumpkin seed itself, if
anyone has parasites anywhere

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.990 align:middle line:84%
in their body, they can't stand
the nutritional components

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.540 align:middle line:90%
of a pumpkin seed.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And so it helps to clear that.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.245 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
it actually activates

00:53:36.245 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the electrolyte of the
sodium near the bone

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and strengthens bones
in the same process.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a complex
thing, apparently.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What's in the pumpkin
seed that doesn't allow that?

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: I wish that I knew
the actual made-up 17th century

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Latin names of those
nutritional components--

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Sorry.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.755 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: --but
I try to avoid it.

00:53:55.755 --> 00:53:56.755 align:middle line:90%
I do know a lot of that.

00:53:56.755 --> 00:53:58.046 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: We'll be here all day.

00:53:58.046 --> 00:54:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: And when I lecture
at medical symposiums,

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I get into all of that.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You make sure you do.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: But when we're
talking to people about

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the truth, nature's complex
so that we don't have to be.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.847 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, it makes it
really simple, actually.

00:54:11.847 --> 00:54:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
thing, by the way,

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.680 align:middle line:84%
this is an arthritis pack
that you put together.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You can actually make
a poultice of this.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.250 align:middle line:90%
We have the recipe for you.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 crushed garlic cloves,
three crushed hot peppers,

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:29.310 align:middle line:84%
two teaspoons of
olive oil, clove oil.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.950 align:middle line:84%
You mix and soak all
of this together,

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and you massage it
into the muscles,

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and it actually
helps break up plaque

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.840 align:middle line:84%
from the out-- which
is a great idea,

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.100 align:middle line:84%
because the skin
itself is an organ.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It is.

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so all of this
will absorb right into the skin.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It will.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And it'll go right
through the interstitials,

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.910 align:middle line:84%
right to the site of where
the pain and everything is.

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It'll just go right to it.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's really fascinating.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you can put
that on your knees--

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Yes.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --joints.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It'll get right into the joints.

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Absolutely.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you've seen
this work on people.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: I have.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.921 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That is a great one.

00:55:00.921 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have done an
incredible job of telling us

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.590 align:middle line:84%
what works for what
organs in the body.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We forgot to mention our
beautiful olives, by the way.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Those are great for
the endocrine system.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about our olives.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned to me that
there's only one disease.

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:84%
There's only one cause
of disease out there.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:21.111 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TOLMAN: Ancients taught
the wisdom there's only one

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:23.910 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can check
on medical websites,

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say there's
anywhere from 16,000

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to 36,000 plus 17,000 rare ones.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:90%
There's one.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to agree
with it, and now

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of doctors and
researchers are coming to it.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The only dis-ease or
discomfort that exists

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.470 align:middle line:90%
is chaos at the atomic level.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:84%
That chaos at the level
of atoms creates chaos

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.680 align:middle line:84%
at the molecular level,
which creates chaos

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.160 align:middle line:90%
at the cellular level.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And when enough cells are
in chaos, you feel it.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
symptom, which means

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:84%
a sign or a signal of
a chaos in the body.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:03.550 align:middle line:84%
There's only two
causes, only two.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It's no mystery.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to keep
spending billions looking

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.880 align:middle line:90%
for this blah, blah, blah.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.360 align:middle line:84%
There's only two causes of
disease in the body, toxicity

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.530 align:middle line:90%
or deficiency.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you live in a
modern developed country,

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.075 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
toxic and deficient.

00:56:21.075 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah, both.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It's probably both.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So these foods and more
will help restore the balance

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and find order within the
chaos of the atomic level.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And it can actually physically
help repair the cells

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:33.680 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.596 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Absolutely.

00:56:34.596 --> 00:56:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So this is a great
example of how food can truly

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.112 align:middle line:90%
be our medicine.

00:56:38.112 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: It's what it does.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.955 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You're awesome.

00:56:39.955 --> 00:56:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: You're awesome.

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:42.681 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You're awesome,
Cowboy Don Tolman.

00:56:42.681 --> 00:56:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You have been terrific.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You're a fountain
of information.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: I love what you do.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, you too.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: You're awesome.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I love what
you bring to us.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>> TOLMAN: Thank you.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thank you so much.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.672 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to watch my
interview with Don Tolman

00:56:55.672 --> 00:56:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and share it with
your friends, you

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.410 align:middle line:84%
can go to gaiamtv.com and
share it with your friends.

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Great wisdom about
ancient cultures here.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:08.025 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:24.534 align:middle line:90%
