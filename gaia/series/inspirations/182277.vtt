>>LISA GARR: "Men

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:10%

the best-selling relationship

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%
book of all time,

among many other shows,
for the past 40 years.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:10%
In his new book,
"Beyond Mars and Venus,"

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:10%
John explains why being a man
or a woman in today's society

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:10%
is more complex than ever.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:90%

>>JOHN GRAY: I am so
happy to be with you.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
There are so many questions
that go along with relationships

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
What has changed since you
wrote the book in the '90s?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAY: Well,
actually it started

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:10%
happening I think in the '60s.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Because I grew up in
the '60s, a teenager.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:10%
I grew out my hair like a girl.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I had bell-bottom pants, boots.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I demonstrated for peace.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I was liberated from being just
a traditional male to moving

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
onto my more loving self,
my more feminine self,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:90%
becoming whole.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.467 align:middle line:84%
And as I shifted from masculine
to feminine, it was ecstatic.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, all the
women were shifting

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
from being traditional women
to being empowerment groups.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
heads of corporations.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
We want to this power.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rosie the Riveter.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Make a difference,
become President, all that.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're experiencing
the ecstasy of release

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
from this limitation
of being on one side.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Spirit released us.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we can connect with
our true self, which

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:90%
is both masculine feminine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And so as you become
more close to wholeness,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:90%
you feel fantastic.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
creativity comes,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that's where power comes,
that's where love comes,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that's where lasting
passion comes,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
when you have both
masculine and feminine.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
However, we have
physical bodies and we

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
have to honor-- if
I have a male body,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
I have to make sure I stay
grounded in my masculine body.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And women have to be grounded
in their female hormones.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Actually, very hormonal.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is hormonal.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Male hormones, female
hormones, and if I go too far

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to the female side, then
I become angry, irritable,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.322 align:middle line:90%
depressed, and I waste time.

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
For women, if they go
too far to the male side,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
they're very
confident, powerful,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
but they can't sleep at night,
or they can't fall in love.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They can't relax.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So busy, busy, busy.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So these are symptoms
of imbalance.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So by understanding
it's a good thing,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we've got a whole new set of
problems and relationships.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
By understanding
this, relationships

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
can help us find that balance.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So because we have
a different level of growth

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
now-- we are more
evolved as a human race

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
about different things
around consciousness--

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:90%
our environment, morality.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely an increasing
level of consciousness

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that this has
affected relationships?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Of course.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.458 align:middle line:84%
Even all of our
emotional issues--

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
so many emotional
issues people have,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
go to therapists and all that.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a step
in the right direction

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
because now we have
more self-reflection.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just being
numb to what's going on

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously acting out
patterns of drama in our lives,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:90%
we can reflect.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We can step back and look
at what's going on inside.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And where I see the key factor
is in our relationships.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
You can't hide from yourself.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Your partner is going to push
every button inside of you.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
When you're out of
balance, it's going

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.895 align:middle line:84%
to show up in your relationship
more than anything.

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that true?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.875 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:34.292 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, and
so what we do is

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn, OK, what
are the symptoms of being

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:90%
out of balance?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
How do I come back into balance
and what does that look like,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and what does that mean, and
what are the benefits of that?

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And quite simply,
what I can say,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
after 33 years of
marriage, the benefits

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of learning to continually
use your relationships--

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
primarily intimate,
but all relationships--

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to come back into balance, in
your intimate relationships,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you can experience
lasting, romantic passion.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.047 align:middle line:90%
That is a possibility.

00:03:58.047 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Younger generation
today says, I don't

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:90%
know if it's a possibility.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
It just goes, it
goes, and it goes.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And younger people
are waiting longer and longer

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:90%
to get married.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, what happens
is that they get together

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and the passion goes away.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
They're friends,
they like each other.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have to have
a lot of reasons sometimes.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But it just-- the juice
isn't there, so they move on

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and move on.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And why the juice isn't there,
why that attraction isn't

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
there, that's what we can
learn by learning new skills,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:84%
how to create that lasting
love, that lasting connection.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
if you go back 50 years,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
people didn't really care
if the passion went away.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.605 align:middle line:90%
That was normal.

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Go back hundreds
of years, people

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.917 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know what
passion was, basically.

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And often women will say to me--

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Romeo and Juliet, OK, passion.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they died the day
after they got married.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It was standard policy that you
lose attraction to your partner

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:90%
after a while.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
When you got married, it
was always, does he make--

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, you look at
the basic characteristics

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
for survival and security.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But once we're able to
provide that for ourselves,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
our needs shift to
wanting a higher

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
level of emotional fulfillment,
which then shifts into a higher

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%
level of self-actualization.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And people who want
passionate marriages, that's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:90%
called self-actualization.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.375 align:middle line:84%
That's bringing
forth the genius.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Because historically,
nobody ever

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
had lasting passion in marriage,
or it was extremely rare.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Kings and queens had
separate bedrooms and, yeah,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.227 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, there was nothing
going on between them.

00:05:16.227 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
That's a-- you know, King
Arthur and Guinevere--

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
it was Lancelot.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
was short-lived.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.715 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It's always
the unavailable guy

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%
that has the passion.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't last.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:90%
But you can make it last.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And here's the dynamic.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
People say, why does it go away?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, when there's newness,
it stimulates a brain chemical

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:90%
called dopamine.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine gives you
passion, excitement.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you just went somewhere new.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You get excited.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
same thing over and over,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:90%
you get used to it.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Familiarity kills passion.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So you always can
find familiarity--

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, newness in

So how do you keep the passion?

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Polarity.

When you recognize that

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
men can connect to the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
they always want to connect.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%

It's in our primitive brain

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Women motivate men.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And the most-- see, a
woman doesn't get naked

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:90%
with just anybody.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:90%
You have to be special.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to be important.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.353 align:middle line:90%
You have to be number one.

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:90%
You have to earn that.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman
opens up like that,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
it just makes a man feel

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that reptilian brain,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:90%
do the dishes, get a reward.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:90%

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Women don't go shopping
for men who do dishes, OK?

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.392 align:middle line:84%
That was generally the
lower part of the chain of,

00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
you want a guy with a job
that makes a bit more money

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you go back
to the instincts, what

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
happens is that that
primitive brain,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
it promotes the production
of sexual hormones.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
One of those is
testosterone, and that's

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the primary difference
between men and women

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Men require 20 to 50 times

in love with a woman.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Men need that testosterone
to get up in the morning

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
in order to do their job and
do things that they don't even

want to do, but have to do.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're happy to do
it as long as there's

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:90%
a reward of someone loves them.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.208 align:middle line:84%

going to get the big reward,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.978 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian brain kicks up
the testosterone big time.

how to make testosterone,
and that's the dynamic.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Even for health, they find
that taking testosterone

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make you
healthier, and actually can

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
inhibit your ability to
make your own testosterone.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's learning
how to make it.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, part of
understanding men and women

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize that
man's well-being comes

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:84%
when behaviors between
a man and a woman

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
promote testosterone in him.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And for women, her
well-being is directly

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
tied to more female
hormones, not testosterone.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.728 align:middle line:84%
It's estrogen and
progesterone and oxytocin,

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
which helps to lower
the testosterone

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:90%
so her estrogen can go up.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:90%
So we're like little see-saws.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So when women go too
far to their male side,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.263 align:middle line:90%
their estrogen goes down.

00:10:04.263 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is happening
now with more women

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace, higher
positions, more stress levels.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
also not letting

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
go of the nurturing home
duties with the child raising

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%

the aging parents.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:84%

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
We can shut it off.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Women have more difficulty
shutting it off.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is when women
are over on that male side,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
they can do it to
a certain extent.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:90%
But the body seeks balance.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So after she's
achieving goals, she

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:90%
wants to come home and relax.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
That's going over
to the female side.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And when she goes over
to the female side, what

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
she might find is a
bunch of messy feelings.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Because see, she's been
pushing them down all day long

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:90%
to look--

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she just wants to
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: The workplace is
a place where you can't

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:90%
share all your feelings, OK?

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:90%
You have--

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Especially now.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
right up front with--

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
competent, confident no
issues, no questions.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
I've got solutions.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's your male side.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That pushes emotions down.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And for women,
those emotions need

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to come up and be
expressed if they're

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
going to have estrogen.
See, men don't

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
need to do it as much because
men don't need the estrogen so

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.922 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we need
the oxytocin that

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
comes from that ability to
share and talk and collaborate.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: What oxytocin
does-- it became aware

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:90%
about 20 years ago.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We found that when women
are talking about things,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
oxytocin goes up and their
stress levels go down.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, a little more deeper
science, you go into it,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
is that when women are talking
and feeling relaxed and sharing

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
what's inside, oxytocin--
the bonding hormone--

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:90%
starts getting produced.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And as an outcome of that,
testosterone starts going down

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and her estrogen
starts going up.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.152 align:middle line:84%
And as testosterone
goes down, her

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:84%
progesterone-- if that's needed
at that time in her cycle--

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
will come up.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone is
actually the substance

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:90%
they make testosterone out of.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So when women are in that
male, achieving goal thing,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
they can't make the
progesterone their body needs.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens, if they're
in the cycle from ovulation

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:90%
to their period, they get PMS.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They get what's called
estrogen dominance

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
because their progesterone
levels are so low.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Because literally,
biologically, your body

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
makes the testosterone necessary
to push the feelings down

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to get the job done, to push
away-- gee, I don't like this,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.855 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to do it any
way to achieve the goal.

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
That's testosterone.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.737 align:middle line:84%
It lets you go and do the dirty,
difficult, dangerous stuff

00:13:11.737 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:90%
without whining and complaining.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.737 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But estrogen,
on the other hand,

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
gives us the ability
to communicate.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:90%
It's what makes us social.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to reason, have

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
better logic, better decision
and executive functioning.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: All personal.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Estrogen helps
us with so many thing.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: So many things.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.553 align:middle line:84%
But simplified, it
makes you happy.

00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does, yeah.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It's love.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We've really got
to come down to,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.113 align:middle line:90%
we need more love in our lives.

00:13:32.113 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:90%
We need to be happier.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're happy,
you're loving your life.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
You're loving the
people in your life.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.377 align:middle line:90%
You're forgiving the people.

00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're happy, when your
estrogen levels are higher,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.335 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
what's good instead

00:13:41.335 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of focusing on what's not good.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.667 align:middle line:84%
Low estrogen can produce
high perfectionism.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
When you live in that world,
nothing is ever good enough

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and no man is ever good enough.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So when a man gets the
message he's not good enough,

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:90%
his testosterone goes down.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get that
message you did a good job,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was good enough,
you feel accepted.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You got that
from your mother, even.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:90%

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.407 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: If you go to--

00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've taught
in San Quentin,

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and prisoners never got that.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.348 align:middle line:84%
They basically--
here's the irony.

00:14:10.348 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Such low self-esteem
because they never got that.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.235 align:middle line:84%
So they turned to
criminal behaviors

00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
because they don't feel they're
going to be loved and supported

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%
in what they do.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, when
you do dangerous stuff,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
it does produce a
lot of dopamine,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:90%
which gives you motivation.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're successful at
something and people love you,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.063 align:middle line:90%
you get a lot of dopamine.

00:14:27.063 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't get
love, you find other ways

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:90%
to get your dopamine.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You could be doing dangerous
things, you can be doing drugs,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
you can waste all your
life watching porn.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
All these things produce
dopamine and ironically,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.925 align:middle line:90%
why do men need more dopamine?

00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
on their male side.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.175 align:middle line:84%
They're not accomplishing
and achieving

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and getting love for it.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Men need love, women need love.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But often, it's a
different kind of love.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the biology of men

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
biology of women--

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting, real
quick, how relationships really

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
boils down to chemistry.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Oh, yeah.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything is
more than just chemistry.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:90%
We have spirit, we have a mind.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is we
live in this house here

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and it's affected.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You can have all the spiritual
insights in the world,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and if you're deficient
in the right hormones,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be depressed.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And a big
misunderstanding-- this

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is a great takeaway
from our conversation--

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is when you think about men's
aggression and bad behavior--

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:84%
selfish behavior and so
forth, hurtful behavior,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
being mean, not caring,
being abusive-- this happens.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
what's happening in men,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks
it's testosterone.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:90%
But actually, it's not.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Any man who is
aggressive, angry, upset,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
mean, his testosterone
is actually going down

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and his estrogen is going up.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
When men go too far
to the female side,

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:90%
they become dysfunctional.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
When women go too
far to the male side,

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:90%
they become unloving.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't love if you're
not on your female side.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But if men are too much on the
female side, they can't love.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, there's no excuse
for a man being aggressive

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and et cetera with a woman.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.545 align:middle line:84%

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.117 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But let's
learn from that.

00:16:00.117 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's learn from
big arguments, OK?

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is like--

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
unless you understand
the difference

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
between men and women,
this would not make sense.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.303 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in an
argument with your wife,

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
if you're a man, you need
to realize, stop talking.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're upset, when
you have emotions and you talk,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:90%
then your estrogen will go up.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This why women
come to therapists.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
They get to talk
about their feelings.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
90% of the people who will pay
to just have someone listen

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to your feelings is because
if you're low on estrogen,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
go talk about your
feelings to somebody.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Let them enter into
you, penetrate into you,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:90%
and hear you with empathy.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Your estrogen levels will go
up and your cortisol levels

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:90%
will go down.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Hormonal balance
lowers cortisol.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
When you have elevated
cortisol, your hormones

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:90%
are out of balance.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to, in our
stressful times, well,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
part of how we create stressful
lives by the expectations

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and the requirements that we
have in order to feel good

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
or to feel lovable
or to get happiness

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, we have
all these standards.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They are created from
hormonal imbalance.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And then we experience stress.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Our choices-- the
choices we make

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.902 align:middle line:90%
tend to come from our hormones.

00:17:05.902 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are you saying
that it's not really

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
the nature of men and women
having a difficult time

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:90%
communicating?

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It's because our
hormones are so out

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
of balance because of
our stressful lives

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
that it then impacts
the communication.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: That, too.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying-- that
actually is another way

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
of saying what I said.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But what
I'm saying is often

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
we say the stress is causing
the problem, and what I'm saying

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
is the choices we make based
upon hormonal imbalance,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
not knowing how to
balance our hormones.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.083 align:middle line:84%
This is a new thing
we have to learn,

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:90%
how to balance our hormones.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
We all know hormones
are out of balance.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not through taking
the hormones, though, right?

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.672 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No, not through taking--

00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
if you take hormones,
you're not learning

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.463 align:middle line:90%
how to make them yourself.

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And your body is designed,
at every stage of life,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.023 align:middle line:84%
to make the right
amount of hormones.

00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Many women will say, oh,
I'm going through menopause

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
so I can't make
as much hormones.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't make
as many hormones,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
but that's not the
source of your problem.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.373 align:middle line:84%
It's the balance
of those hormones.

00:17:56.373 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
no longer at the age

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
where you can make
babies, your body

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need as many
hormones, but it needs

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:90%
the right hormonal balance.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like
learning what behaviors

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:90%
stimulate female hormones?

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.483 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors
stimulate male hormones?

00:18:10.483 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you should
be a traditional woman,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
where most of your life is just
stimulating female hormones.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:90%
We've outgrown that.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:90%
That's too limiting.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness says,
I want to be whole.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So if you're going
to express your male side,

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to learn
along the way how

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.157 align:middle line:84%
to keep coming back
to your female side,

00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:84%
how to keep coming back
to your female side.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And a relationship
can be a safe harbor

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
for women to come back to
their female side, and for men

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to actually rebuild their
testosterone after their day.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.083 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So women and men,
they get in a little argument.

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Couples get in these
fights, arguments.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Women and men.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:90%
There's starting to be tension.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we understand
this dynamic,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that
whenever men are

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
argumentative, defensive,
irritable, angry,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
their testosterone
levels are going down.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Their estrogen
levels are going up.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
For him to talk at that time
will only throw him further out

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And once he's in a
fight or flight mode,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
for her to talk to him at that
moment will just throw her out

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of balance because he cannot
hear her with empathy.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
When you're in cortisol
mode, you cannot hear someone

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:90%
in empathy.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.445 align:middle line:90%
So suddenly--

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And her
testosterone's going up too.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: She has
to defend herself.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.148 align:middle line:84%
She has the raise her
sword and defend herself.

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Her estrogen goes down.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
She needs to find somebody
to talk to about her feelings

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:84%
to open her heart again,
and go back and approach

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:90%
that conversation.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
He needs to stop
talking, withdraw,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
do something that will
boost his testosterone-- we

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%
can explore those things.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Boost the testosterone.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Then, when it
comes back up, he's

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
going to open his heart again,
reflect on what just happened,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and go back and start again.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So take a break.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're having an
argument, take a break.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Both go to your
respective corners.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
One doesn't talk,
the other one talks.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:90%

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, to somebody else.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%

the communication's different.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Only when you
have your heart open.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't try to attack that
problem again right away.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
You come back and
do loving things

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
so you feel safe and
comfortable again.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:90%

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
whenever I go to my

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:90%
I would come back and give her--

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
kind of touch her on her hair
or whatever, see where she is.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
If she bristles, then she's
still needing her time.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But she'll
melt into my hand

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I might join in
doing something with her,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and I give her and say,
I love you so much.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we just-- like that
whole argument didn't happen.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.303 align:middle line:84%
You just let it go back, let
yourself re-establish trust.

00:20:26.303 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you're

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to invest
in something, or make money,

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%

you say that about finances

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship

>>GRAY: Money.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.025 align:middle line:84%
And how you raise the

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And how you spend your time.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.675 align:middle line:84%

00:20:52.675 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're saying it's

>>GRAY: Well, the
conflict part of it--

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.748 align:middle line:84%
the tension part of it is we
start to feel not heard, OK?

00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Then our hormones are
going out of balance.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
What men start to feel and
what women start to feel

If men need more
testosterone, what

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
are the kinds of love and
messages of love that men

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:90%
need to rebuild testosterone?

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:90%
You're like a magnet.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
You make men feel like, I
want to do more for you.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to give more for you.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
So appreciation is one thing.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And women want to
be appreciated too.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And it will boost
their testosterone.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:90%
But generally speaking--

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.198 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: If they accept it.

00:22:07.198 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Either one, you don't
need as much testosterone

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
if you're a woman.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And often, when
women are out of balance,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.607 align:middle line:84%
one of the signs of
being out of balance

00:22:14.607 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:90%
is, I don't feel appreciated.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Really, she's saying my male
side needs more appreciation.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what her female
side needs at those times is

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I need more respect.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I need to be honored.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.450 align:middle line:90%
I need to be prioritized.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I need to be treated
with respect.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what women need the most.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.732 align:middle line:84%
Their mind goes, oh,
I'm on the male side.

00:22:31.732 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You feel, I want
to be appreciated.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you need
to be respected more.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:84%
That raises estrogen.
So appreciation

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
bumps up testosterone,
respecting, honoring, helping,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
supporting-- so when I talked
about men listening and not

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
talking right away,
that's honoring her.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to-- many
men today, if they

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.417 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
differences, she

00:22:51.417 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
says you're not listening to me.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, you're
not listening to me.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.503 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: He'll complain
right back, you know?

00:22:56.503 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Why do you get to talk
and I have to listen?

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like you're
in preschool.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: We go right into it.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:90%
All these couples will do this.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.897 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: --it's not like
it's just men that close up.

00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Women close up too.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:84%
They close their
hearts, and they

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
get into all this
little stuff like that.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.478 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we say we need
to take care of ourselves,

00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and then we retreat.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, if you retreat
to share how you feel,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
it's probably the most
powerful estrogen stimulator

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility to
bring your hormones back

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Also, taking me-time, nurturing
time, is also a good thing.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But typically, when it
came from conversation,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
having somebody-- or even a
journal and praying to God

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- a lot of different
ways to articulate what

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:90%
you're feeling.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you
articulate emotions--

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, yes, use your
voice, use your words.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It helps so much.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: So much.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is when you use words,

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
this part of the
brain is now in charge

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:90%
of this part of the brain.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
See, we got reptilian
brain, we have monkey brain.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
All the conditioning
of our childhood,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
our parents' childhood,
their parents' childhood

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:90%
all got passed on to us here.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have these automatic
reactivity, which is always

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
about right and wrong, judgment,
good and bad, protection,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just automatic reactions.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:90%
That's this part of the brain.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of the
brain, prefrontal cortex, that

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:90%
has the only DNA that's human.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part of us where
we can self-reflect and go,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think I could
change what I just did.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I adjust myself.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I can adjust that.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the higher
consciousness part.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.368 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yeah, this is
the higher consciousness.

00:24:19.368 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is the
higher human self,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
which can connect with
the higher consciousness

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:90%
self, spirit.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the mind.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Then we got all this
reactivity, and then we

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
got reptilian stuff that drives
so much that we don't even

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
any control over it,

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
but we can decide
what it should do.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is like on
Friday, you say, OK, I'm

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
going to lose some weight,
not eat so much dessert.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's this part of
the brain saying that.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.276 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And then
you see the dessert

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.025 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well,
I'll start tomorrow.

00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:90%
That's this part of the brain.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.072 align:middle line:84%
So the point of view of
discipline-- and not saying

00:24:48.072 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to be so
extremely disciplined--

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
but whenever you
discipline, what happens

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
is you make this part
of the brain stronger.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.077 align:middle line:84%
And this part of
the brain doesn't

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
control this part of the brain.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you articulate
what your emotions are,

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.013 align:middle line:84%
without trying to
change somebody--

00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:90%
that's very important.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:02.847 align:middle line:90%
Articulate how I feel.

00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:03.647 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:03.647 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: See, if I'm using my
emotions to get you to change--

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
primitive-- that's

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:90%
what the monkey brain does.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It gets angry--

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I want it my way.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: My way or
I cry a lot, then

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:90%
you'll change out of sympathy.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm afraid so I don't
have to do anything.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The monkey uses emotions
to manipulate and change

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
other people and
change situations.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is go
to this part of the brain

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and articulate, to somebody
who understands us-- that just

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.800 align:middle line:84%
helps us to connect
more with empathy--

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:90%
what we're going through.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So that this part of
the brain's in control.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to go
back to your partner with all

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:84%
this blame and all
this "you hurt me"

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.493 align:middle line:84%
and all this "I'm
angry with you."

00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Because what are
they going to do?

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They're just going
to defend back.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of human beings.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
This is so great because
we don't necessarily

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:90%
have this model in our lives.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us maybe
watched our parents--

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
products of the '50s,
products of the '60s and '70s.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really this level
of equality in a relationship.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make
sure our audience knows

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that it is same thing with same
sex marriages and couples that

>>GRAY: And you honor that.

00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is that if you're
having these symptoms of heart

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.090 align:middle line:90%
closed, OK?

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just if your
heart is closed,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
your hormones are out
of balance for you.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
No one can tell
you what that is.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to find it for you.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
when women are heart-closed,

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:84%
they're too far on
their male side.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
A symptom of that is "I have
so much to do, I have to,

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to."

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Overwhelm.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:84%
That word in our brain that
says I have to, I have to,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:90%
that is on the male side.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.282 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, that's the best
phrase I have in my life.

00:26:40.282 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I have to get up and do this.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I have to write this book.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That actually raises
my testosterone

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and gives me the
energy to do things.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.688 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's talk about sex.

00:26:47.688 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%

her testosterone goes--

00:26:58.285 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
unfortunate things.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll take an extreme
version of this in China,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.108 align:middle line:84%
where women don't even
know they can enjoy sex.

00:27:05.108 --> 00:27:06.915 align:middle line:84%
They just do it to
placate their husbands.

00:27:06.915 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It's this
ordeal they do,

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
where sex education--
and for women

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to learn that sex is
actually for them,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and that sex is actually one
of the most powerful ways

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to increase estrogen.
But generally speaking,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you need a willing partner
to focus their desire on you.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So sex communication is a whole
area, learning sexual skills.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Often, men are not
educated in that.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Often women don't
understand what

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.953 align:middle line:84%
makes their body more
fulfilled during sex.

00:27:30.953 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So women need to
understand that sex is more

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:90%
about giving to themselves.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: How can that happen?

00:27:36.357 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:84%
How do we get more
clear about that,

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and how can a man support that?

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, the
way she can-- it

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:84%
can be about her

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:90%
how to guide a man in sex, OK?

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: So this is like--

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.240 align:middle line:84%
if you say to a man don't do
that, he'll shut down, OK?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Most men, particularly when
they're that vulnerable,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:90%
they can't take criticism.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.822 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to take criticism.

00:27:56.822 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn how to
communicate in sex,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.113 align:middle line:84%
you can have fun
having conversations,

00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:01.645 align:middle line:84%
make jokes while
you're having sex.

00:28:01.645 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a really good
place to be if you

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.652 align:middle line:90%
can keep that energy going.

00:28:04.652 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning,
couples usually get quiet

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
communicate about it.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
They're so afraid of being
rejected because you're

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:90%
so vulnerable at that time.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The man is vulnerable
because all he wants to do

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:90%
is please the woman.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems to the woman
that all he wants to do

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.002 align:middle line:84%
is please himself, but
actually, he wants to please her

00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and that will please himself.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%

00:28:23.783 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.825 align:middle line:90%
That's what women have to--

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:90%
one distinction.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Men in the past didn't care
about pleasing women in sex.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It was for men.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And women did it for
men as an obligation.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Conscious men today--

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
almost all men that
I've ever met, when I--

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.107 align:middle line:90%
I do classes on sex, OK?

00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So in there, we have the
men talk about their best

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:90%
sexual experiences.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
There's not one exception
to this in the room.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The man will describe
the woman's orgasm.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.665 align:middle line:84%
It's her pleasure that
makes him feel so good.

00:28:50.665 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
See, this is the
bottom line difference

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
If I can make you happy,
it boosts my testosterone.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy,
I feel like I failed.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But then women go, why does
he have sex the way he does?

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:10%
Because he doesn't
understand women's timing,

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:10%
a woman's body, what she needs.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.867 align:middle line:10%
And women often don't.

00:29:07.867 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:10%
They just think,
what's wrong with me?

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not orgasmic.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't enjoy this.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, she might need a good
20, 30 minutes of foreplay.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.085 align:middle line:84%
And so she has to learn
how to slow him down.

00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And here's a simple phrase.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Mm, feels so good,
let's go slow.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Slow.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Move his hand up here, put
his hand behind your ear.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Blow in his ear, mm.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Give him the idea, do
the little things to him

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:84%
so he gets the idea that's what
he does for you if he's not

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.255 align:middle line:90%
open to just being told.

00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's communication
that you're talking about.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is having
communication before and after

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and during sex.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all about communication.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And it's
attitude about sex.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Sex is a beautiful thing.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- anything
beautiful can be misused.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But what women
have to understand

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is when a man is erect, that's
his most vulnerable place.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That's when his
heart opens the most,

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's why sex
sometimes creates violence.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Because men whose emotions from
childhood are so packed down,

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
the hatred, the rejection
from their mothers,

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:90%
the abandonment issues.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So when they're
feelings open up,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what to do with it.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Their estrogen shoots up and
they become their worst self.

dating and the different type

hook-ups and instant attraction?

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%

Men have this
expectation now you're

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.993 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have sex with
them because so many women are

00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:12.888 align:middle line:84%
yielding to that
without relationship.

00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:90%
And that could be their choice.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't judge it.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.998 align:middle line:84%
But when you're with a man and
you want to go slower with him,

00:31:18.998 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
do it just for him,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
you want to wait till
your fire ignites,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it might take slow to
do with this person.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, when he's
wanting to move faster,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the things you
can say is, oh, I really

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:90%
like to go slow.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:84%
My whole body wants to,
but I just want to go slow.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:84%
All he really needs to
hear is there's a chance,

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:84%
there's an opening
that you want it.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It can calm things
down as opposed

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:90%
to him feeling rejected.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Sexual rejection
is so hard on men,

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
just as emotional
rejection is hard on women.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.100 align:middle line:84%
If she's expressing
her feelings, men,

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:84%

that's ridiculous,

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
you're overreacting,
well, that's stupid.

00:32:16.877 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
it kind of sounds like
all men are that way.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And not all
men are that way.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are some
very, very sick men who are

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:90%

>>GRAY: Very sick men.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --starting
to go to jail.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: There always have been.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we're bringing light to
that, we're bringing education.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And my point is
you can educate men

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the world
about how to treat a woman,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't educate men
how men and women are different,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:84%
they're never going
to get it sexually.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Because a woman can grab
my butt and I like it.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't care who she is.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:84%
If she bumps into my
crotch, OK, that was nice.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel offended by
it, I'm not hurt by it.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:90%
And some women aren't either.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:90%
But many women are.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.757 align:middle line:84%
There's a sensitivity that women
have that men can't comprehend.

00:32:57.757 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: More than ever
now, there's a heightened--

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: A heightened
sensitivity.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, if you want
a man to be more considerate

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of women,
rather than painting his him

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:84%
as bad, paint him as
ignorant and teach him

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:84%
all the other ways
women are different.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.223 align:middle line:84%
Then he can easily
swallow the idea

00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that it's a totally different
experience for a woman

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.285 align:middle line:84%
to have a man come on
sexually in that way.

00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
key, that is key.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And one of the
good things about Me Too--

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.757 align:middle line:84%
I'll say the good
thing about it--

00:33:23.757 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:90%
is I like consent.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
great for couples

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to be able to talk about sex,
about affection, about touch.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things in my marriage
that made it work so great

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.268 align:middle line:84%
is if I'm in the mood
for sex, I'd say,

00:33:36.268 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
honey, I'm in the mood for sex.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.958 align:middle line:90%
Let's have sex soon.

00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I had no issue with, oh,
I'm going to be rejected

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It was an easy thing to do.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Many couples, the man wants to
have sex but doesn't say it.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The woman doesn't
know he wants sex.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And other times, she's in
the mood, but she's not.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:84%
There's all this mystery
around sex instead of being

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.152 align:middle line:90%
able to openly talk about it.

00:33:54.152 --> 00:33:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the techniques

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.152 align:middle line:84%
I do for couples
that have difficulty

00:33:57.152 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:90%
talking about it is candles.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:90%
His candle, her candle.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:84%
If ever she's in the mood,
she should put that candle,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:90%
light that candle.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.297 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it'll be a
celebration for him.

00:34:05.297 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
When he's in the mood,
he lights his candle.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.534 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean we
have to have sex tonight.

00:34:09.534 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:84%
It means, I just
want you to know

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm having these
feelings towards you

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and you can reciprocate when
you want to let me know.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's
no pressure there.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No pressure.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So back to-- so I read this
poll about men and women

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace,
and that men are

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
terrified to talk to women
now in the workplace,

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
in fear of losing their jobs
for some type of an accusation.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And the poll was
around, basically, women

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
stay by themselves and
men stay by themselves.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.918 align:middle line:90%
So this needs repairing.

00:34:34.918 --> 00:34:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, men and women have
to communicate in the workplace

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's collaboration
that can happen.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
How can we repair
the conversation?

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:90%
How can we do that?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, I
think, as we soften--

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
right now we're swinging
in one direction--

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: --and looking at that.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, as
with everything,

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.777 align:middle line:84%
the pendulum swings back
and we will soften with it.

00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But ironically, in
a world where we're

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.985 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring men
and women together,

00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:84%
close, what we've
just created is

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:84%
another riff of, you
know, men can't be men,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:90%
women can't be women.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:90%
But there's a reflection.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.100 align:middle line:84%
When we pull apart,
there's always a reflection

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.762 align:middle line:90%
of how we can make adjustments.

00:35:08.762 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the main points

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:90%
from "Beyond Mars and Venus."

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't understand men,
if men will stop talking

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and say I need to think
about this and withdraw,

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
women will go after
him and judge him.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that, how can you
pull out of a conversation?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll go after him at a
time when anything he says

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:84%
will only make it worse
for her and for him.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just
share, with Bonnie,

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I remember when we were 23
years into the marriage.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.312 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
beautiful things she said.

00:35:35.312 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:84%
All my messages basically
are coming from her.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
She taught me all this stuff,
and I contributed somewhat.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So at 23 years, I remember
I said, honey, how

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:90%
do you rate me as a husband?

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling particularly
confident that day.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, John, as a
father to our children,

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine a better father.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:90%
A plus, A plus.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.110 align:middle line:84%
As a husband,
you're not perfect.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:90%
So I paused.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, tell me about that.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, I
know every time--

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:84%
she said you're not
perfect, but you've

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.923 align:middle line:84%
given me the best gift
any woman could ever want.

00:36:10.923 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, what's that?

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I know
that, for 23 years,

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll say things and do things
that can really upset you,

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
but when you get upset,
you always stop talking.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:90%
You go to your cave.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:90%
You do some magic--

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is-- and
you come out with more love.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We're always loving
each other more.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's nothing I
can do to ever push you out

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.095 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:36:31.095 --> 00:36:33.470 align:middle line:84%

I'm not a perfect husband,

the best gift she
could ever want simply

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
because if I started to get
angry, I stopped talking.

So do something you can do well.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
That will always boost
your testosterone.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you feel

testosterone goes up.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:90%

to do to come back to
settle and open their heart

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.675 align:middle line:90%
is talk about their emotions.

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
If you go out and do
something you're competent at,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.575 align:middle line:84%
your testosterone
is going to go up.

00:38:11.575 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to
disconnect from your emotions.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to disconnect
from your emotions.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.807 align:middle line:84%

disconnect from them,

00:38:17.807 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
when you finally get
there, they're very messy.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is they're
stronger than they should be.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They're an accumulation
of other things

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that are bothering you from 15
years ago, from here to here.

They all come up like a volcano.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, when
you have excess emotions,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:84%
strong emotions, your brain's
job is to justify them.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So now you say, you
did that and that's so

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.070 align:middle line:84%
bad, it makes me feel all of
this, as opposed to all of this

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Could be your
parents' childhood.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole
basis of psychology

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.388 align:middle line:84%

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And so many people--

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.050 align:middle line:84%
they even end their marriages
as a conscious uncoupling,

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:90%
which is as friends.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:90%
But why do they do that?

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't excite
each other anymore.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes--

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:84%

And I grant, that's
a great thing to be.

But often, what brought
them to that place

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of ending a relationship
is the lack of passion

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle line:90%
in the relationship.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And here's the irony.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the higher self
that wants the passion.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.350 align:middle line:84%
The old fashioned self says,
hey, contentment is fine.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And for those who want
contentment, that's fine.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.957 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
world used to be.

00:39:31.957 --> 00:39:34.040 align:middle line:84%
You're almost like a
business arrangement, brother

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.163 align:middle line:84%
and sister, after
the sex goes away.

00:39:36.163 --> 00:39:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong with
that if people choose that.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
thing, which is

how to create lasting passion.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%

oxytocin lowers testosterone,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.457 align:middle line:84%

I stroke my wife's hair.

00:40:05.565 --> 00:40:07.190 align:middle line:84%
That means that

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.800 align:middle line:84%

planning something,
little things.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Buying three flowers

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Calling her on the

four hugs a day.

First time I see her,
I give her a hug.

And it's not just a quick hug.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a full-body--
not sexual, pump hug--

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.332 align:middle line:84%

I squeeze her in my arms

A look of disapproval

to change somebody, manipulate
them with the monkey brain.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.372 align:middle line:84%
Getting upset with
him and telling him

00:42:05.372 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't do that,
it really hurt me.

>>GRAY: So yes, he can poke
you and it makes you unhappy.

00:42:50.053 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.657 align:middle line:90%
But how can you become happy?

00:42:52.657 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
temporarily unhappy.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And then your response--

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: He can poke you.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Somebody can bruise me, OK.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But if I say you are
responsible for that bruise,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.308 align:middle line:90%
I can't heal it.

00:43:02.308 --> 00:43:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who has to heal it.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I have to come back to happy.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So every time you want
change, look inside.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.878 align:middle line:84%
Find your own dissatisfaction
and come back to happiness.

00:43:11.878 --> 00:43:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does it mean to
come back to happiness?

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.227 align:middle line:84%
Hormonal balance, that's
the whole message I have.

00:43:16.227 --> 00:43:18.810 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do when you're
unhappy trying to change a man,

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
come back to producing
estrogen. That's it.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what women are lost in
today, their testosterone side.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone in women will
always say, it's a problem,

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:90%
it has to be fixed.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.030 align:middle line:84%
A problem and it
has to be fixed.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough, not enough.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:90%

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll clean the poop
up off this baby.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Being in love is
high levels of estrogen.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Your estrogen levels
double if you're

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:90%
a woman to have an orgasm.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:90%
This is ecstasy.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:84%
We men want to go
inside of women

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to have our estrogen levels
go that high through you

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But then it causes
our testosterone

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to go down, which is
why we go to sleep

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:59.098 align:middle line:84%
and we pull away to rebuild the
testosterone to then come back.

00:43:59.098 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other dance of intimacy.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
relaxation thing.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So we come
back to, basically

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
for women and estrogen, how to
stimulate estrogen for women.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
One thing is I'm
coming back to her.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:84%
She's stressed, she's
overwhelmed, whatever.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:90%
I join in.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I do something.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That stimulates oxytocin.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin lowers her
testosterone, which

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.600 align:middle line:90%
is the drive to fix and solve.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you're helping.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%

you're doing

00:44:25.597 --> 00:44:28.272 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Our job has always
been to help women be happy.

00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not any different.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just women are
different today.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't need men
to make the money.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.445 align:middle line:84%
They don't need men
to hold a guard--

00:44:34.445 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:84%
hold a sword outside
the house, saying,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:90%
don't go to war, all that stuff.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: What is
our role anymore?

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So men don't
understand our power

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to provide support for women so
that women can make themselves

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
happier, A. And B,
once a woman is happy,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.550 align:middle line:84%
then we can do our real job,
which is to make her happier.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.805 align:middle line:90%
Only men can make you happier.

00:44:54.805 --> 00:44:55.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: That's it.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.030 align:middle line:90%
If you're heterosexual.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.680 align:middle line:90%
You're making her happier.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And that brought such
awareness to me as a man.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's huge.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: My job is not
to make her happy.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.798 align:middle line:84%
So on days when
she's not happy, I

00:45:04.798 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:84%
go, OK, I'm going to help
her find her happiness.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:90%
What can I do to help?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.180 align:middle line:90%
But I can't change her.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I can only provide a
context to support her

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.200 align:middle line:90%
in finding her happiness.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But once she's in that centered
place, I can take her happier,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's romance.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.540 align:middle line:90%
That's romance and great sex.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can't
make her feel anything.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.365 align:middle line:84%
You can provide the context
so that she can feel better.

00:45:25.365 --> 00:45:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And that's
the new relationship

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:90%
if we want to grow today.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It's 100% accountability
for what you feel.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't be blaming the
world for how you feel.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You can acknowledge, the
world made me feel this way.

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.470 align:middle line:90%
But now I have the ability to--

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.400 align:middle line:90%
anyway, four steps.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
First step, stop trying
to change others.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Come back to

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.960 align:middle line:90%
you're not happy and fulfilled.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.335 align:middle line:84%
Your hormones are
out of balance.

Do something to
balance your hormones.

00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You will come back to a

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Because you're way over here.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.400 align:middle line:90%
You're to come back over here.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Then step three is
not to ask for more yet.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Give more.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:84%
This is where-- if you give
more from fulfillment, then

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.120 align:middle line:90%
it's received.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If you give more from
emptiness, it's manipulation.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And men smell it and women
end up feeling resentful.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.057 align:middle line:84%
Resentment is the killer
of estrogen. I did this

00:46:12.057 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:90%

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:13.690 align:middle line:90%

It is.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Resentment is very, very toxic.

when you're in your male side,
you do things for reward.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone is I do
things for reward.

a man to clean up

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.313 align:middle line:84%
him to do the dishes after

they shouldn't need a reward

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:90%

Yes, whenever you

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.245 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate a man, you

00:46:48.245 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
See, that's called taking
your partner for granted.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example of

take your partner for granted?

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.668 align:middle line:84%
Well, I took Bonnie
out for dinner--

00:47:01.668 --> 00:47:02.960 align:middle line:90%
a nice little place for dinner.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm leaving and I
open the door, romantic,

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I was a little bit dressed up.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.262 align:middle line:84%
And this very dashing,
handsome man comes walking up,

00:47:09.262 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:90%
opens the other door for her.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.515 align:middle line:84%
So she's got two men
opening the door for her.

00:47:12.515 --> 00:47:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And she walks through
like a queen, you know?

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to have people
open the door for you.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at that man
and she says, oh, thank you.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, what did the
tone of voice say?

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The tone of voice
said, oh, thank you.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to do that
and you did it anyway.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, John, I do his laundry,
so he better do that.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.620 align:middle line:90%
He owes me.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.300 align:middle line:90%

All this expectation

00:47:51.053 --> 00:47:52.220 align:middle line:90%
They stop stroking the hair.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They stop saying you look
so beautiful, I love you.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.495 align:middle line:84%
You're so smart,
it blows my mind.

00:47:57.495 --> 00:47:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You can say that
a million times.

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gets tired of it.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I love you is four times a day.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Give a hug.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Hold hands when you're walking.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.730 align:middle line:84%
These little things we
did in the beginning,

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.278 align:middle line:84%
men stop doing because, well,
she should know I love her.

00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have to do that stuff?

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I already did that stuff.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Men stop doing
it and women stop it.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: That's the point.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's a combination.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Exactly.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Both sides, we take for granted.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.870 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to recognizing love
is-- when you love someone,

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:90%
you want to give them to them.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:90%
That is step three, remember?

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Stop trying to change.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Come back to balance
so now you're full.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Now overflow into
them so you're giving

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.460 align:middle line:90%
without requirement of return.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Loving is what it's about,
giving love, not receiving.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.900 align:middle line:84%
For children, it's
about receiving love.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:90%
We want to receive love.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.510 align:middle line:90%
That's our childlike self.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.875 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self, our
spirit self, wants to love.

00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wants to give love, yes.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.265 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah, to give love.

00:48:45.265 --> 00:48:46.682 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
understand, what is

00:48:46.682 --> 00:48:48.410 align:middle line:84%
the love that's most
important to men

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to bring out their best side?

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.740 align:middle line:84%
What's the important
love for women?

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.040 align:middle line:90%
So I summarize it.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:90%
There's many forms of this.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Appreciation, we talked about.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: When you appreciate
the things he does,

00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:59.990 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to going,
well, I did his laundry,

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:90%
he should do the dishes.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Or I made all this money,
he should do da-da-da.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:03.580 align:middle line:90%
All that little tit-for-tat--

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So just a simple act
of appreciate is so easy.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Again and again.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.943 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be "thank you."

00:49:07.943 --> 00:49:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It can be delight.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is so helpful.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
What a good-- any
chance you have

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge
something he does,

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:84%
it's just a little wave
of love and keeps you

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:90%
in that estrogen mode as well.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.280 align:middle line:90%
That's appreciation.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.290 align:middle line:90%
The next one is acceptance.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Acceptance is don't try to
improve him, change him,

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.430 align:middle line:90%

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if he doesn't
do anything like the dishes,

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:30.890 align:middle line:84%
or she doesn't do
anything to help?

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.553 align:middle line:84%
What do you do if there's not
even anything to appreciate?

00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:34.970 align:middle line:84%

finish how to give,

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Step three is you've

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:84%

how do I get more?

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.420 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got there yet.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:90%

you're really content within
yourself, you're whole.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now you're giving
more of what you

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.210 align:middle line:84%
know they need the most of
to pump their hormones back

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.010 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:53.090 align:middle line:90%
You can help them.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Appreciation, acceptance--
don't try to change them,

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.170 align:middle line:90%
don't disapprove of them.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:00.103 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself doing it,
suck it up, go somewhere else.

00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Rebuild your hormones,
come back into balance,

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:84%
where you give
unconditional love.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the guy you picked.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.930 align:middle line:84%

Hopefully you did a little

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.640 align:middle line:84%
You said, OK, he's the

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to accept
him just the way he is.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, so then you accept.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So you don't give
unsolicited advice.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:90%
That's one part of it.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:90%
You don't punish.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't withdraw your love
because he didn't do things

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.530 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:90%
He's not perfect.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what love is.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's doing
the best they can.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the most spiritual thing
to accept someone the way

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.770 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone's always looking

Men need to feel trusted
and women need to trust.

00:50:52.712 --> 00:50:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Of course, every
woman says, I need

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.940 align:middle line:90%
to feel I can trust my partner.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, as much as you need
to feel you can trust him,

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.820 align:middle line:90%
he needs to feel trusted.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is he makes a
mistake-- he goes to his cave,

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, and you go,
oh, he doesn't love me.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.320 align:middle line:90%
No, he doesn't love you.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.653 align:middle line:90%
I mean, of course, he loves you.

00:51:07.653 --> 00:51:10.010 align:middle line:84%
He's protecting you by going
to his cave to come back.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But you've pulled
back your trust.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he'll ignore
you for a few days.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.200 align:middle line:90%
He's busy working, whatever.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And say, oh, I close up because
he hasn't been loving me.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing in
that moment is going,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't trust that
he really loves me.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.205 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
little loopholes

00:51:22.205 --> 00:51:24.060 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
find your reassurance.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.172 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And now, women
do need reassurance.

00:51:26.172 --> 00:51:28.310 align:middle line:84%
What I would know as a

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:90%
whenever possible.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why doing lots of
little things all the time,

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that little affection,
that little warmth,

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:84%
it gives her the reassurance
so she can give me what I need,

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:90%
which is the trust.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:90%
But what do I need?

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:84%
When people say
you're a hero, he's

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.210 align:middle line:84%
someone I'll vote for,
pumps your testosterone up.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.350 align:middle line:90%
They're trusting you.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation
of trust is depending

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:49.580 align:middle line:90%
on a man for certain things.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.355 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you depend
on a man, he's

00:51:51.355 --> 00:51:52.980 align:middle line:84%

Why are they most important?

00:51:59.362 --> 00:52:00.612 align:middle line:90%
They're testosterone boosters.

00:52:00.612 --> 00:52:01.085 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Totally.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But not
even close to a man

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.920 align:middle line:84%
because biologically, he needs
30 times more testosterone

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.650 align:middle line:84%
than any woman walking
around, even the tough women.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now what do women need?

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Men have to understand caring,
consideration, empathy,

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:90%
understanding, respect.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:90%
So summarize it.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Caring, understanding,
and respect.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And that category of caring,
one of the first things that

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
happens when women are not
what we want them to be--

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is the immaturity
in men-- is we go into,

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:33.110 align:middle line:90%
well, then I don't care.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, then I give up.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And what
do women do when

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.960 align:middle line:90%
they don't get what they want?

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.335 align:middle line:84%
They go, well, I
can't trust him.

00:52:37.335 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:90%
I can't trust him.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Just as a man goes into I
don't care, I don't give a--

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.195 align:middle line:84%
whatever, she goes
into, I can't trust him.

00:52:43.195 --> 00:52:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And she'll start looking
at all the evidence of why

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.480 align:middle line:90%
he's not perfect.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.140 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to all the evidence
of you can trust he loves you.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:49.770 align:middle line:90%
He cares.

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:50.603 align:middle line:90%
He's doing his best.

00:52:50.603 --> 00:52:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Things are getting
better and better.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.045 align:middle line:90%
That's what trust is.

00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It's belief in the
possibilities rather than

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:84%
believing in the
impossibilities.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to women
when their hormones are out

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.440 align:middle line:84%
of balance is they can't go
into the place of trusting

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and accepting and appreciating.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And when men's hearts are
closed, we stop caring.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.918 align:middle line:90%
We lose our motivation.

00:53:08.918 --> 00:53:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to do
the little things

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.580 align:middle line:90%
that we did in the beginning.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So do women.

00:53:12.413 --> 00:53:13.530 align:middle line:90%
We stop caring as well.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.997 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, that's
a further-on stage.

00:53:15.997 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
It takes much longer--
women first go into,

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't trust him.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And then I'm not
going to give to him.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's hurt, resentment.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It happens right

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a journey to it.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But her first thing is not
to just go well, then, I

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:27.820 align:middle line:90%
don't care.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.455 align:middle line:84%
Her first thing is to go, well,
I don't trust that he loves me.

00:53:30.455 --> 00:53:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So now she's going to look
for messages that he loves her

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:33.620 align:middle line:90%
or doesn't.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, she's so hurt,
there's so much resentment,

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.840 align:middle line:84%
it takes a lot for a woman to
say, well, then I don't care.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about a man that
cheats or betrays a woman?

00:53:41.947 --> 00:53:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Or a woman who
cheats and betrays the man?

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.210 align:middle line:90%
have more opportunity.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:90%
So what's the question?

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll give you
my answer to it.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you repair that?

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.362 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I see it over and over.

00:53:53.362 --> 00:53:55.061 align:middle line:90%
And I think one of the--

00:53:55.061 --> 00:53:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to sound
judgmental, so I--

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a big
mistake for many couples

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:84%
who love each other, have
children, and one of them

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.610 align:middle line:84%
has an affair, however
it's found out.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Then the other partner
basically says, I will stop

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and let's try to make this work.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And you rebuild
the relationship.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.050 align:middle line:84%
What we do is when a
partner has an affair,

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.520 align:middle line:90%
we use that quite often--

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.853 align:middle line:84%
not everybody-- as an excuse
to end the relationship.

00:54:22.853 --> 00:54:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Already they weren't
getting what they needed.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It wasn't
working anyway.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It wasn't
working anyway,

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and by conscience,
you can't go, I'm

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.130 align:middle line:84%
going to get rid of this
partner when you have children.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Because all the research
shows that two happy parents

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:90%
produce the happiest children.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to
be extra challenges when

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you get a divorce, and
there's a lot to be said of--

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:40.640 align:middle line:84%

divorce rate out there.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's over 50%.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: I've written a book
with Warren Farrell called

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.370 align:middle line:84%
"Boy Crisis," and it
affects boys dramatically.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.360 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.263 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, if
you do get a divorce,

00:54:53.263 --> 00:54:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the best thing you can do
for your children is never

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:58.010 align:middle line:84%
say a disparaging word
about your partner.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.733 align:middle line:84%
Always hold them
up in high esteem.

00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Because that little boy, when
you talked about his father,

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.840 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about him.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.080 align:middle line:90%

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm just being on the
woman's side for a moment--

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:11.240 align:middle line:84%
you're disparaging
the man, which

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
happens much more than
men disparaging women,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:90%
statistically.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.440 align:middle line:84%
She's disparaging the father,
a little girl gets the message,

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.350 align:middle line:90%
can't trust men.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.250 align:middle line:84%

I'm not good enough.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And what that does inside of a
boy is, when a woman is upset,

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.600 align:middle line:84%
he merely gets
defensive and goes, see?

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I failed.

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.550 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to, oh,

Let's see what I have to do.

00:55:33.225 --> 00:55:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't have that
huge reactivity

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.075 align:middle line:84%

enough inside yourself.

00:55:37.075 --> 00:55:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you are

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.720 align:middle line:84%
treat your partner

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's the most
important thing.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: The other thing
is-- back to affairs--

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:84%
is find a way to find
forgiveness and keep

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:84%
the marriage
together, even if it

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.050 align:middle line:90%
means having an open marriage.

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell your children, grow up.

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.470 align:middle line:90%
We need to open our minds.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:84%
To have children having to
move back and forth from home

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:90%
to another--

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.990 align:middle line:90%
it's really hard on them.

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually have
a mother and father who

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:07.300 align:middle line:84%
no longer enjoy sex together
for whatever reasons,

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.745 align:middle line:84%

discrete relationships outside.

00:56:09.745 --> 00:56:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Discrete, yeah.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.670 align:middle line:84%

sexual needs, but the love

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.800 align:middle line:90%

just have so much

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.405 align:middle line:84%
condemnation on people

00:56:18.405 --> 00:56:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the worst
thing in the world.

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.290 align:middle line:84%
When you go to many
other cultures,

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.873 align:middle line:84%
it's not the worst
thing in the world.

00:56:23.873 --> 00:56:26.150 align:middle line:84%
We've painted it as the
worst thing in the world.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And quite often, we're
so insecure about love,

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the thought that your partner
could be with somebody else is

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, I knew it.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:32.890 align:middle line:90%
They didn't love me.

I can't get what
I need from them.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's a neediness.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.565 align:middle line:84%
It's an insecurity
within ourselves.

00:56:37.565 --> 00:56:39.190 align:middle line:84%

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:40.345 align:middle line:90%
condone it and go do it.

I'm not saying that at all.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.842 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying you

00:56:43.842 --> 00:56:46.300 align:middle line:84%
hold it against your partner
for the rest of your marriage.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.380 align:middle line:90%

>>GRAY: Step four is
the most important,

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.300 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't work unless
you do the previous steps.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So you've given up changing,
you're coming back to center,

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.930 align:middle line:84%
you're now understanding
what your partner needs

00:56:58.930 --> 00:56:59.925 align:middle line:90%
to feel more loved.

00:56:59.925 --> 00:57:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Now they're going

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.220 align:middle line:90%
motivated to give more to you.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, women are
automatically naturally more

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.640 align:middle line:90%
motivated to give more.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.130 align:middle line:84%
When you give a man more,
when you give him more,

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.130 align:middle line:84%
he thinks, oh, I did a good
job, so he'll tend to do less.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it gets
very confusing for women.

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you just gave him
all this love and then

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.330 align:middle line:90%
he gets lazy.

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's like he did this
job, you gave him love,

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and he feels like,
OK, now my job's over.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So once he feels
love, that's when

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.180 align:middle line:84%
you use step four,
which is to ask

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.320 align:middle line:84%
for more in small
increments with big rewards.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And the big reward,
again, is being

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.540 align:middle line:90%
delighted and appreciative.

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
way to motivate

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:36.160 align:middle line:84%
men to change to become
more of who they are

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.450 align:middle line:90%
is through connection.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.360 align:middle line:84%
His connection is when he feels
successful in doing something

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.330 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line technique
to create connection for women

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:47.110 align:middle line:84%
is give him the
opportunity to serve you.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:47.990 align:middle line:90%
How can you do that?

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So he's sitting in
there watching TV

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, honey, when
you get a chance, I need help.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Already, you've
just opened the door

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.070 align:middle line:84%
to get more in
your relationship.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.778 align:middle line:84%
He's going to go,
well, what do you need?

00:57:58.778 --> 00:58:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'll tell you when you
have only five or 10 minutes.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Let him wonder about it.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.657 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to be?

00:58:03.657 --> 00:58:04.948 align:middle line:90%
Well, go ahead and tell me now.

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I'll put a pause on the TV.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll come over and
do-- what is it?

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.020 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.915 align:middle line:84%
And you give him a
little task to do.

00:58:09.915 --> 00:58:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Would you help me with this,
would you help me with that?

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, the
most important task

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that any man can do that
will actually help you

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.940 align:middle line:84%
more than anything, in
my opinion, is I just

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.070 align:middle line:84%
want to tell you about
what happened today.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to say anything.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to talk about
my frustrations, my concerns,

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.220 align:middle line:90%
and I'll feel better.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And then give me a big hug.

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.680 align:middle line:90%
It'll only take a few minutes.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Give him the complete
instructions.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't say anything.

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't fix it.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.643 align:middle line:90%
Then give me a big hug.

00:58:34.643 --> 00:58:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So you talk a little
bit about your day.

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:37.143 align:middle line:90%
You want to connect.

00:58:37.143 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:84%
All these things have
happened and your two worlds

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:90%
are so separate.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So you talk and then
he listens, and he

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.660 align:middle line:84%
might interrupt with some
solutions, which men do.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And go, no, no, I don't
need you to say anything.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Just listen.

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to
be a few minutes.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And just share inside
whatever you're

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.180 align:middle line:90%
willing to share with him.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a few minutes,
go, oh, that felt good.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:55.347 align:middle line:90%
I feel more connected.

00:58:55.347 --> 00:58:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And go in for a hug and go, mmm.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.872 align:middle line:90%
And then walk into another room.

00:58:59.872 --> 00:59:02.080 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, he's going
to go, gee, what happened?

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I did nothing, I said
nothing, and she thanked

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.890 align:middle line:90%
me or it made her happy?

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I can do this job.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So you're now training
him to listen.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the number
one help women

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.530 align:middle line:84%
need to come back
to estrogen land

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.480 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
share what's inside.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.610 align:middle line:84%
When you start feeling
more connected,

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.550 align:middle line:84%
then you start asking for little
things like, honey, tonight,

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:23.050 align:middle line:90%
if you're doing dishes--

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.060 align:middle line:90%
you imply dishes if he's not.

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.283 align:middle line:84%
And when he married you,
he wasn't, let's say.

00:59:27.283 --> 00:59:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, honey, I'm
really tired tonight,

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.242 align:middle line:84%
without I'm (WITH EMPHASIS)
really tired tonight.

00:59:31.242 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm really tired tonight, would
you help me with the dishes?

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Just ask for help
with the dishes.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And then that moves
into, oh, I just

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:39.280 align:middle line:90%
want to sit and relax tonight.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Would you do the dishes?

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's already
been built up knowing

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:46.400 align:middle line:84%
that when I do dishes, later on
that night, there's great sex.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.200 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.654 align:middle line:90%
That's a little reward as well.

00:59:48.654 --> 00:59:49.454 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:59:49.454 --> 00:59:50.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And it will, you know?

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:53.590 align:middle line:84%
The research shows that
when men do domestic things,

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.480 align:middle line:84%
it improves the
sex life, primarily

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.840 align:middle line:90%
because there's more connection.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.640 align:middle line:90%
But communicate--

00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And support.

00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:59.343 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And support.

00:59:59.343 --> 01:00:00.340 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't feel alone.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for a woman to warm
up if she feels so separate.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:06.050 align:middle line:90%
She wants to get close again.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But not just so that
you should do that.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I do this, why
don't you do that?

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:11.498 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But because
she's giving, giving,

01:00:11.498 --> 01:00:15.707 align:middle line:84%
giving all day long, that's
the receiving that she needs.

01:00:15.707 --> 01:00:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But what I'm
focusing on here,

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:19.443 align:middle line:84%
the first receiving
should be, I need

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:21.735 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody connect with
me through understanding.

01:00:21.735 --> 01:00:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So say it.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.577 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: If you start with, I
want you to do these things,

01:00:25.577 --> 01:00:27.910 align:middle line:84%
there's not going to be such
a payoff because you're not

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.620 align:middle line:90%
really in estrogen land yet.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
If you can share your
feelings, a man penetrates.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
See, listening is the most
masculine thing a man can do.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
He penetrates into you
deep on an emotional level.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're opening the
door for him to come in.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.970 align:middle line:90%
It's literally emotional sex.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And then that opens you up to
produce the hormones where,

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
when you have sex, it'll
be more fulfilling for you,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
which then makes him more
motivated to do things for you.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Which is then the
advanced course.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have a nice
orgasm and you're in bed

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:57.575 align:middle line:84%
and you're lying together
and he feels like Superman,

01:00:57.575 --> 01:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
then you say, oh,
honey, tomorrow would

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.730 align:middle line:90%
you do this for me?

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Ask for more when he
feels like Superman

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and he will always say yes.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brilliant, brilliant.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.260 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's try that.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really glad that
you said step four because it's

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.620 align:middle line:90%
a great piece of advice.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not instinctual.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.955 align:middle line:84%
The instinctual part
is, can you do this,

01:01:20.955 --> 01:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
can you do this,
can you do this?

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Without the can you, when you
have a second, listen to me?

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, I'll give
you even a subtle touch.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Never say to a man "can you?"

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Because his immediate
reaction is, of course, I can.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Are you wanting me to?

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.307 align:middle line:90%
Are you asking me to?

01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
See, we want to hear the
request because we know there's

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
a reward for the request.

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
See, if you say, honey, can
you pick up the kids at school

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.360 align:middle line:90%
today?

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
My first reaction is,
sure, I can do that.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
will make your life better?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you say honey, would you
pick the kids up from school

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
today, it's now a
vulnerable place

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.855 align:middle line:84%
you're coming from--
more vulnerable.

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Would you pick up the kids?

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, I'm too busy,
it's going to affect you.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you say could
you pick up the kids

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:01.397 align:middle line:84%
and I say, no, I can't do
it today, I'm really busy,

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:02.530 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't affect you.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.325 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a protection
from feeling vulnerable.

01:02:05.325 --> 01:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
When you make a request,
"I really like this, would

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:08.260 align:middle line:90%
you do that?"

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.000 align:middle line:90%
As opposed to "could you do it?"

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
"Could you" is just closing
up your vulnerability.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I'd
really like to take

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.395 align:middle line:90%
some extra time for myself.

01:02:14.395 --> 01:02:16.638 align:middle line:84%
Could you please
pick up the kids?

01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:17.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the way to say it?

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Even "could you please,"
forget about the "coulds."

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Just try to take could
out of your vocab.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a subtle distinction, but
many men will relate to this.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It's "would you
pick up the kids?"

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to emphasize,
I really, really need this.

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Just say I need to
rest today, would you

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.842 align:middle line:90%
pick up the kids today?

01:02:33.842 --> 01:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
When you say it that way,
there's an assumption

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that of course he'll want to
do that because he loves you.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.742 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So on the
way home from work,

01:02:39.742 --> 01:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
would you pick up an extra
pound of butter or something.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can say that.

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it'd be great.

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And expect, in the beginning--
because this is a new art

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:50.120 align:middle line:90%
of asking--

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.612 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: --he's going to forget.

01:02:51.612 --> 01:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So the third point with the
art of asking, and that's

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
in my "Men are from Mars"
book, a whole chapter on it,

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:58.180 align:middle line:90%
and the more recent ones.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask a
man and he's not

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.997 align:middle line:84%
used to getting
rewards for things,

01:03:01.997 --> 01:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
he will forget them because
they're little things.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Would you pick up the milk?

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.562 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really a milk man, so
I'm not going to remember that.

01:03:07.562 --> 01:03:10.137 align:middle line:84%
So when he forgets, you
just don't say anything.

01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The next day, you
say, oh, by the way,

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.595 align:middle line:84%
when you get home from
work, on the way home,

01:03:13.595 --> 01:03:14.770 align:middle line:90%
would you pick up the milk?

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
He will immediately
remember, oh, my gosh,

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
she asked me before
and I forgot to do it,

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and she's not giving
me a hard time.

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:22.058 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to go,
oh, I'm really going

01:03:22.058 --> 01:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
to try to pick up the milk.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
But he'll forget one more time.

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.557 align:middle line:84%
And then this time when he
forgets and he comes home

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:29.432 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, honey,
did you get the milk?

01:03:29.432 --> 01:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, I forgot.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I forgot.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
He'll feel like, I'm not
going to forget again,

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and now you've got
a guy wanting harder

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.475 align:middle line:90%
to remember the things you ask.

01:03:37.475 --> 01:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As long as
she doesn't get mad.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
as long as she's not
disapproving of him.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
As long as she doesn't go into,
I knew it, I can't trust you.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: You trust he's

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But this is a
guy-- maybe he's a plumber

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
or maybe he's a
investor, whatever.

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.392 align:middle line:90%
He's not a milk man.

01:03:53.392 --> 01:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not what he's been
conditioned to do his life,

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to remember to bring milk.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just ask
for something you really

01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:59.290 align:middle line:90%
don't need.

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.207 align:middle line:84%
Don't expect it and you
won't be disappointed.

01:04:01.207 --> 01:04:02.603 align:middle line:90%
And then when you finally--

01:04:02.603 --> 01:04:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: When you say--

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
when you ask for something
you don't really need,

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.528 align:middle line:90%
let's define need.

01:04:07.528 --> 01:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
If I bring home the
milk, it actually

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
makes her life a little easier.

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what you want,
is to make requests

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
for things that make your life
a little more easy until he gets

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
into the mode of
doing things for you,

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
knowing he's going to
get this sweet reward.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
See, we're trained
as men, big things.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
If you really need it,
the house is burning down,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
then we get up and go.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But if it's just a
little thing, we forget.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We want to train a man,
little things get as much love

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:34.300 align:middle line:90%
as big things.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, you've got

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
a lasting romantic relationship
where he's giving you

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
a little affection,
he's complimenting you,

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%
he's looking you in the eyes.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
These are little
things and women need

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
them to keep bumping
up the oxytocin that

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
will lower the testosterone
and bring her back to estrogen

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or progesterone, which
is the hormones she

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:50.590 align:middle line:90%
needs for well-being.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the mind reading?

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, he should have
brought me flowers?

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It would have been so
nice if he would have just

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.702 align:middle line:84%
brought me flow-- he should
have opened the door?

01:04:57.702 --> 01:04:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't he pay for dinner?

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
What about those mind-reads
that we would like to see?

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:06.055 align:middle line:84%
They got edited out a
long time ago, right?

01:05:06.055 --> 01:05:07.555 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, mind
reading is awful.

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: OK, you have to see
how you're keeping yourself

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.470 align:middle line:90%
from feeling love.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:12.758 align:middle line:90%
But then you feel powerless.

01:05:12.758 --> 01:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you how Bonnie
got me to bring flowers.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
This is a funny story.

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.668 align:middle line:84%
After a year of marriage,
I stopped bringing flowers.

01:05:18.668 --> 01:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I'm going
out the house to work

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and there was a vase
right by the door.

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
and then walked out.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Then the next day, there
were three vases by the door.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what is that?

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
The next day, there
were 12 vases.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
She even borrowed
vases from neighbors.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, honey, what
are these vases doing here?

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, John, what
do you put in vases?

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that was
cute indirectness.

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's great.

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.088 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But what
we have to realize

01:05:41.088 --> 01:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
is, as we become
more mature, it's

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
important to be
specific and direct.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.767 align:middle line:90%
And so we had a conversation.

01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, well, honey, if
you want flowers, why don't you

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
just buy them?

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600 align:middle line:90%
She set me straight.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
She says, John, it's not
romantic if I buy them.

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's the thought.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
If you remember to
bring the flowers,

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.010 align:middle line:90%
it makes me feel special.

01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's sweet.

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And if I have to ask for
it, it's not as special.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.710 align:middle line:90%
That taught me to do this.

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Bonnie would say to me, on
Monday, she'd say, John,

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting my hair
done this Thursday.

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.355 align:middle line:84%
Now, my first reaction
is, who cares?

01:06:11.355 --> 01:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.037 align:middle line:90%
Then I figured it out.

01:06:14.037 --> 01:06:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Why does she tell me that?

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she's giving me warning
so that when she comes home,

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
I notice.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you say something.

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I say something.

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if she has to say,
what do you think of my hair,

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not as exciting
as opposed to me,

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.600 align:middle line:90%
oh, you got your haircut.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.450 align:middle line:90%
It looks great.

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.790 align:middle line:90%
It makes a bigger impact.

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it
makes a bigger impact,

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.943 align:middle line:84%
but if a man doesn't
do it, it's not

01:06:33.943 --> 01:06:35.110 align:middle line:90%
because he doesn't love you.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.318 align:middle line:90%
It's he's not educated.

01:06:36.318 --> 01:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take
this step forward

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to educate him with a little
request, which is, honey,

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
when I come home from
getting my hair cut,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I want you to notice and
say how beautiful I look.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And then forget it.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
into the computer

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.130 align:middle line:90%
so he can start learning.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Because men, we
don't consciously

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.800 align:middle line:90%
think that's so important.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.210 align:middle line:10%
But to me-- like
when I give a talk

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:59.170 align:middle line:10%
and I get a standing ovation
and I don't have to ask for it,

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.297 align:middle line:10%
it's 1,000 times more
than if I worked for it.

01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:03.630 align:middle line:10%
And every performer knows how
to get a standing ovation.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You can set it up and
do this, but I refuse to

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
so that when I do it, it
was really unsolicited.

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.520 align:middle line:90%
It just came.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I hold that in my mind.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
What Bonnie wants is for
me to do these things

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
without her having to ask.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if
you're not getting it, women,

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to start asking till
he learns to do those things.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had a 35-year
incredible relationship

01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:28.217 align:middle line:84%
with Bonnie, and it was a
monogamous relationship.

01:07:28.217 --> 01:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have an open
relationship, right?

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No, no.

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you had magic
in that relationship, right?

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:37.012 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Yes, and we still have
the magic, but she's not here.

01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She's not here.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Physically.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, she is
in spirit now with us.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.570 align:middle line:10%
And we wanted to
dedicate this show to her

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:49.990 align:middle line:10%
because she has been such a
huge influence on our lives.

01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.070 align:middle line:10%
She's inspired the greatest
relationship book of all time.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And we put together a
little in memoriam--

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful piece here
for you to just take

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a look at this show that's
being honored in Bonnie's name.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.079 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Thank you.

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: I love you, Bonnie.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We love you, Bonnie.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:28.243 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: We miss you so much.

01:09:28.243 --> 01:09:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She is here with us.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:30.952 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: She's with
us, she's with us.

01:09:30.952 --> 01:09:35.109 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to acknowledge
my book should have

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:37.399 align:middle line:90%
said by Bonnie and John Gray.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:39.559 align:middle line:84%
She's a piece of every
page in that book.

01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:40.359 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:41.817 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And all
the work I've done.

01:09:41.817 --> 01:09:43.687 align:middle line:84%
And since she's
passed, I can't even

01:09:43.687 --> 01:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
imagine how I could come close
to what I've done in this world

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.620 align:middle line:90%
without her.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
She was always there for me,
supporting me in this journey.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's one of
your greatest gifts.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: She is.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the gift
that keeps on giving.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Even watching that, you
see the spirit that she is

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and it just lifts
off the screen.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
sharing her with us,

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for sharing
your wisdom with us

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.260 align:middle line:90%

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.176 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, John.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:12.600 align:middle line:90%
