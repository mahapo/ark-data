00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:10%
Can being a spiritual
leader and an activist

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:10%
and a teacher of a
course in miracles

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
prepare a person to
run for Congress?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, today my guest
is Marianne Williamson,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:84%
and she is running
for a seat in the US

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%
House of Representatives.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And she is joining
us here on Gaiam TV

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to tell us why she is
running at this very

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.319 align:middle line:90%
important time in history.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Oh,
thank you so much for having me.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So what inspired
you to go from being

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual leader, activist,
teacher, lecturer, 20,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
25 years to running
for Congress?

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, I, like you
and millions of other people

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:10%
in this country,
have been involved--

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:10%
some of us for years now--

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:10%
in the study and the application
of a new way of being,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:10%
a new way of seeing,
in which love

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
is the center of everything, in
which love harmonizes things,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:10%
in which putting
humanitarian values,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:10%
our relationships
with other people,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:10%
our concern about our children,
our concern about the planet,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:10%
the concern about
the future front

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and center in our own ground of
being, how we live, what we do.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen how this kind
of revolutionary perspective

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:90%
has changed everything.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:10%
It's changed the medical
model into a holistic one.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.945 align:middle line:10%
You see people
talking about seminars

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:10%
on these kinds of things
related to business,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:10%
more conscious business,
conscious capitalism.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You see area after area that
has been saturated and really

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
uplifted and changed by
this new kind of thinking

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%
that is taking hold.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The one area where you
don't see it is in politics.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're also seeing the
damage being done by the fact

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that our political
system is still

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
dominated by the old,
calcified thought forms.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
time for us to apply

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
the new thinking, the new kind
of enlightened perspective

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
to politics as to
everything else,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
or the consequences will
continue to be perilous.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wonder
sometimes if we're just

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
in a fishbowl with this
conversation of consciousness

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and just having a
small community of us.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it really permeating
into the mainstream population

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
enough for--

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so glad you're running
because you are leading us

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
into that conversation,
just as Oprah has,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:90%
just as many have before us.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that
this is a small population

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
of conscious people?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
Paul Ray, of course,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
would argue that there are
60 million people in America.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a little over
300 million citizens,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
but 60 million are known
to read books or do

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
some kind of alternative
practice, yoga or so forth.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're not some
small, fringe movement.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a mainstream trend
in the country right now.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We act sometimes,
however-- certainly when

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
it comes to politics--
like we're a small group.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: There was a
kind of perverse comfort zone.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.174 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have
to take part in larger

00:03:06.174 --> 00:03:07.715 align:middle line:84%
social and political
messy questions.

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't want to
see the negative news.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.535 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to,
yeah, involve myself.

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: The
truth of the matter

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%
is, we are strong in numbers.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:90%
We are strong in vigor.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And anything we touch with our
perspective tends to change.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for us
to, I believe, own

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.079 align:middle line:84%
and to claim our responsibility
as citizens as well.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation
with you before the show

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that
politics isn't my strength.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though I am on a
political radio station,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I talk about
spirituality and health.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have empowered me
back into this conversation

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that I actually do know
what I'm talking about

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a citizen,
because I'm a human being.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON:
Well, the very fact

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that you said that
makes me already,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
a few days into my campaign,
happy that I'm doing it.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:10%
President Eisenhower,
Dwight Eisenhower,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:10%
said politics should be
the part-time profession

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:10%
of every American.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Politics is something that
touches you, regardless of

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:90%
whether or not you touch it.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
What happens
politically affects us

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.647 align:middle line:84%
in issues that have to do
with our daily experience,

00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it's health
care, whether it's

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
the quality the air we
breathe, whether it's

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the
food that we eat,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the economic
disparity that ultimately

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
touches all of us,
the destruction

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.163 align:middle line:90%
of the middle class.

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so
many things that we

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.492 align:middle line:84%
can pretend have
nothing to do with us,

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
but then they absolutely
do have to do with us.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And the French say the
problem with not participating

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
in politics is you will end
up governed by your inferiors.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.397 align:middle line:90%
So those of us who are--

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yeah.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON:
--thinking the thoughts

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that we think are the most
enlightened and the most

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
cutting edge are
the ones who should

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
be the most passionate in our
discussion of political issues.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We're the last ones who should
be sitting out the process.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.593 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I've always
had this perspective

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:49.206 align:middle line:84%
that I can't possibly
permeate that structure.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, write to
my congressman--

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
how many thousands,
millions of letters

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
does that guy get,
girl get, that's not

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
going to get to her ever?

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's my perspective.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
but the problem

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.521 align:middle line:10%
is that your congressman does
not receive that many letters.

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:02.395 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that your
congressman does not

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:10%
receive that many phone calls.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:10%
But your congressman
does receive daily visits

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:10%
from highly paid
corporate lobbyists.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:10%
So that's the point.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.707 align:middle line:10%
Too many Americans
feel that way.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Think this way.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And the system is
invested in your thinking that.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:10%
But it's an erroneous thought.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:10%
There aren't that many
calls, that many letters that

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:10%
have to go into a
congressman's office in order

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:10%
for the congressman
absolutely to hear

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:10%
that the constituents in
his or her district has this

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:10%
or that to say.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.052 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they do
run for election,

00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
so it does matter to them what
the constituents are saying.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would think.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.493 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And like I said,
highly paid corporate lobbyists

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
are assigned to them
all day, every day.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we can't
complain about that,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.459 align:middle line:84%
if we ourselves aren't lifting
our voices as a counterforce.

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's their job.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're paid to do.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.531 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
would have to take away

00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
from our jobs to do to
contact a congressperson.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.525 align:middle line:90%
So interesting, yeah.

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.274 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Why do
you say it would have

00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:10%
to take away from our jobs?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, because
I think, well, it's

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:10%
going to distract me from being
a mom and being a working mom

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:10%
and so forth to
really go in and deal

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:10%
with this issue of the schools.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.872 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Could we
deconstruct that a little bit?

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:09.705 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's, yeah.

00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: OK, so as a mom,
you care what your child eats.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So this issue
of genetically modified foods

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%
probably matters to you.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.921 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: How
is that distracting

00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
from your job as
a mother to write

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
an email to your congressperson
saying, I want labeling.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:10%
I want to make
sure that the fact

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:10%
that these chemical
companies are

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:10%
able to just pour genetically
modified foods into the food

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:10%
supply--

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I'll tell you how.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's
not distracting

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:10%
from your motherhood.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:10%
It should be central
to our motherhood.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because I think
it's a waste of time

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.876 align:middle line:10%
because it's never going
to make a difference.

00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: OK, so I hope
that by this conversation,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:10%
you are open to the
possibility that, in fact, it's

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:10%
not a waste of time.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.625 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there are only about
12 letters or 12 phone calls

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:10%
that have to come
into congressperson's

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:10%
office, a constituent call,
before the congressperson is

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:10%
told about that, we got
quite a few letters today,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:10%
congressman or congresswoman--

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: --about
this or that issue.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.174 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for telling me that.

00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And by the way,
some of the most regressive--

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
what you and I might consider
the most regressive ideas

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and the people who feel
passionate about them,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:90%
they know how much it matters.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.807 align:middle line:10%
Wow, I'm learning a lot.

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: The biggest
problem in our democracy today

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:10%
is the distractedness
of the American citizen.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And it has two pieces to it.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
One, there is a
kind of a lockout.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The system, the political
class, as it were,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is invested in your being
distracted because then they

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:90%
can do whatever they want to do.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, there's
the fact that we now

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
conspire with that by not
taking part, by not calling,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
by not writing.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.722 align:middle line:90%
So it's like--

00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:40.013 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's time for a change.

00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Who
knew, and now you know

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:90%
and you'll do differently.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:90%
That's how this all works.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.092 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's been like
that for such a long time,

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
that we are numb to it.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is why
you're mixing it up.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
That is why you're
calling attention

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
with your campaign,
which I think is--

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in that way, you've already
won, Marianne, in my opinion.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
some of the issues.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.484 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes.

00:07:58.484 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are some
of the ways that--

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I know that one
of your big issues

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.951 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about is the ways

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that our rights have
been slowly taken away

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and are slowly being taken away.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Can you teach me about that?

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that sometimes
when we think of security,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
we think of armies invading
or something like that.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.594 align:middle line:84%
But there are other kinds
of threats to our security.

00:08:18.594 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:10%
And I think the biggest
threat to our security right

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:10%
now is the slow sort of chipping
away of democratic freedoms.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is this about?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we have now is a
system of legalized corruption.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:10%
We now have a situation
where those who represent

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:10%
moneyed interests, whether
it's multinational corporate

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:10%
interests or individuals
with a lot of money--

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:10%
money is now able to
wield an influence

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:10%
on the way our government
operates, very, very

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:10%
disproportionate
to the influence

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:10%
that the average
citizen is able to wage.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:10%
So that when Lincoln described
the government of the people,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:10%
by the people, and
for the people,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:10%
that has now transitioned
into a government

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:10%
of a few of the people,
by a few of the people,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:10%
and for a few of the people.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The two major
political parties are

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
both beholden to those
moneyed interests.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So if the American people
want to change this,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:84%
if the American people
want to push back

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:90%
the trend by which money--

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
especially since the Citizens
United Supreme Court case

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:90%
decision--

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
if the American people
want to say money will not

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
have an undue influence on
our political functioning

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
because it is an
undemocratic trend--

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
a Supreme Court Justice, a
late Supreme Court Justice

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
named Louis Brandeis
said you can either

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
have large amounts
of money concentrated

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of only a very
few, or you can have democracy.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
You cannot have both.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's why.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
That's too much power, money
and governmental power.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you have government
that is beholden to the money,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
you have this very
unholy alliance.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And we expect government
to be our advocates

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to be resisting the
excesses of power.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So I believe-- and this is why
I'm running as an independent--

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if the
American people are

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
going to stand up and do
an intervention, from those

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of us from our kind of
community understands, well,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:90%
you have do an intervention.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I feel
my campaign represents,

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of independent
voice rising up

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
in which we're saying to that
system, you guys take a rest.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We will take it from here.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
What we need are more
people going into Congress,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
absolutely making
our primary issue

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
this issue of building up the
kinds of interim measures,

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.996 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately, perhaps
a constitutional amendment

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to get the money
out of politics.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Because whether it's our food
supply, the mass incarceration

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
rate, the state of
the environment,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
education, or what,
no matter what it is,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
the underlying cancer
is the undue influence

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.099 align:middle line:90%
of money on our system.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you wrote a book
called "The Law of Divine

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Compensation."

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.455 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're not
talking out against money

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:90%
or saying money is bad.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.961 align:middle line:84%
You're just saying the way
that it is handled right now

00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:53.036 align:middle line:90%
is misused.

00:10:53.036 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
first of all, money

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:90%
can heal as well as harm.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
No, money is very important.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's how we put the
food on our table.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
It's how we send our
children to school.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
reciprocal system.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: No.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But what we need in
America, in order

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a free and democratic
and just society,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a circulation
of economic opportunity.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Just as the blood
needs to circulate

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
in the body for the
body to be healthy,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
access to financial opportunity,
economic opportunity

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
has to circulate
within the society.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The American, we have a
system where everybody--

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.752 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, you
have a chance--

00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
every American, if
they work hard enough,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:84%
can make something
of themselves.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We all agree on that.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful thing.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.496 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why people
come to this country, yes.

00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's right.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you continue to narrow
the economic franchise so that

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
more and more people,
because of lack of access--

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
whether it's to health care
or bank loans or educational

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
opportunity--

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.290 align:middle line:84%
find their material resources
and material opportunities

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:84%
so narrowed, then
everybody's just

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
involved in just working
harder, working harder

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
to just stay where they are.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have economic
opportunity, and that's

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
why this whole idea
of 1% when you have

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
just a few hundred
Americans controlling

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
this huge majority of
our economic opportunity,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
it creates an imbalance,
which is not healthy.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is not about, in any
way, redistributing wealth,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
but it is about
redistributing opportunity.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be
just a few Americans

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
who have the access
to quality education.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't be just a few
Americans who have access

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:90%
to economic opportunity.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
That's not just.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That's not democratic.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
That's not the American dream.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.865 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I do not believe we can
continue on this way very long.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, specifically
related to California,

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
which you are running
for, District 33 here

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
in California, I mean, the LAUSD
school system here has been--

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.084 align:middle line:84%
so many of the programs
and the opportunities

00:12:50.084 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
for these children
have been taken away.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher
salaries and everything

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
has been so severely
cut that it is

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
in such a state
right now of dismay

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's forcing people
to go to private education.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, price is
raising higher and higher too.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.149 align:middle line:84%
So it really cannot go
on like this much longer.

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And that
really is the point.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It can't go on.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
At what point do we,
the American people,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:90%
say enough is enough, and stop?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
We must be disenthralled
of the belief

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that the current system
is going to change that.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:90%
The current system--

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: --the chokehold
that the two parties

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
have on the conversation,
where they're

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.859 align:middle line:84%
both beholden to
that same money.

00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
education, you've

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
got the average American
college graduate who

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
took out a bank loan, is
saddled by $30,000 of debt.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, Lisa, as
a mom, a huge issue

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that we must really put front
and center and make sure it

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:90%
stays there is preschool.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you know, but what

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:84%
has happened in
the United States

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is that people who
can afford it send

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
their little ones to preschool.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
People who cannot afford it
are much less likely to send

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
their kids to preschool.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The child who enters
kindergarten not having

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
gone to preschool is
already behind on day one

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of kindergarten, because the
one who went to preschool

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
is already starting to read.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, listen to this
horrific statistic.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.779 align:middle line:84%
The child who did not go
to preschool, if we do not

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
make sure that that child
catches up with their reading

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
skills within two years and
they enter the second grade not

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
having caught up,
they are statistically

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
on a 50% probability track
to incarceration sometime

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh, wow.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.223 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: If we then do not
catch up within two more years

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
by the fourth grade, you can
see a direct correlation between

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
how many American children
cannot read in the fourth grade

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and how many prison beds
we will be building.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I mean, this
is morally unacceptable.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, I can see
it happening because I

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:90%
have a child that age.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.015 align:middle line:84%
And I could see how
when you're left behind,

00:14:45.015 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
it gets demoralizing
and then you start--

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.301 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And you
don't have enough teachers,

00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
so the teachers have to spend
their time helping the kids who

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.406 align:middle line:90%
do know how to read.

00:14:54.406 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you've
got parent volunteers

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.196 align:middle line:84%
in the classroom that
really aren't educators,

00:14:58.196 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and they play favorites.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult
environment, yeah.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.346 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:15:02.346 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have
people in Congress--

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.053 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: --who are saying--

00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
we can't just be complaining
from the sidelines.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: We can't just
be into, ain't it awful?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.673 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: We can't just
be-- and also, we can't just

00:15:13.673 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
be working from a position of
the nonprofit organizations

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%
or the online petitions.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.914 align:middle line:84%
None of that can compensate
for unjust policy

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
within the government.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So being on
the campaign trail

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.805 align:middle line:84%
and putting yourself
out there like you

00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
are, you are going to be
expecting some criticism,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.081 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be, of course--

00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah, last
week I was a crackpot.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else said it
was a vanity campaign.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I love a vanity campaign.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
What's vain about
doing something

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
where the worst, ugliest
pictures possible of you

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.663 align:middle line:84%
are going to be all
over the internet?

00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING]
Well, all right.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that
there will be--

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
we've seen
mudslinging, and we see

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of tricks when it
comes to political campaigns

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
What does a course
in miracles teach you

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
on how to deal with that?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
the course in miracles

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
says in my defenselessness,
my safety lies.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
If I defend myself,
I am attacked.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I spent a year or
so really thinking

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
very deeply about whether
or not to do this.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the issues
that was central

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
for me was, how will I be
able to handle those things?

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
How will I be able to
handle the humiliation

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.937 align:middle line:90%
and the embarrassment?

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:21.228 align:middle line:90%
I've been through some of that.

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:90%
People lie about you.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
People take a truth, and they
embellish it to such an extent

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that it's not at all
what really happened.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I realized what
a spiritual challenge

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that is to be non-reactive,
to have a thicker skin.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, a thin skin is
positive for me in my work,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but negative for me
in my personal life.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
My thin skin helps me
in my work because I

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:90%
sense what's going on.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.111 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But it's
been negative for me

00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
in my personal life, where
sometimes lighten up.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.104 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON:
Don't get reactive.

00:16:53.104 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't get defensive.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So I realized,
well, what could be

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
more perfect for my own personal
growth than here is a situation

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
where, Marianne, your getting
reactive will not help.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Your getting defensive
will not help.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
Your getting angry
will not help.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Keeping
your mouth shut will help.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's all perfect.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is more
than a personal growth campaign

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
This is something that is going
to seriously challenge you.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I've already seen
you take some of those opinions

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and turn it around.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
I remember someone saying, well,
what is consciousness anyway--

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
one of the political
pundits-- and not aware

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation,
which is perfectly normal.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.436 align:middle line:90%
So you said you loved that.

00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, it
reminded me of a lyric

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
from a Bob Dylan song,
"Something's happening here,

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.374 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know what
it is, do you, Mr. Jones?"

00:17:37.374 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
heard that comment,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought he honestly
doesn't know.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I had said,
he was responding

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to a remark I had made that I
don't want to just represent

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
the interests of the
people of District 33,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.207 align:middle line:84%
I want to represent
the consciousness.

00:17:50.207 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
does that even mean?

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.873 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
he honestly doesn't know.

00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
enough of us do know.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for that
knowledge and that understanding

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
to be harnessed for
political purposes.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what is that?

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
a lot of people

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
would take a line like
that and say that's naive.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
We're a bunch of
lightweight thinkers.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I love that one, that those
of us who talk about love

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is the bottom line
rather than money

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is the bottom
line, relationships

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
as the primary
organizing principle,

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
really envisioning and standing
in the possibility of a world

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.977 align:middle line:90%
that works for everyone.

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't
see love in politics

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.768 align:middle line:90%
usually in the same sentence.

00:18:26.768 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, you did
actually when I was growing up.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, during the
1960s and '70s,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.179 align:middle line:84%
we sang "All You Need Is
Love" at political rallies.

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The counterculture-- I don't
know how old you are-- but

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the counterculture
of the '60s and '70s

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:84%
was all about that--
peace sign, love

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and peace, peace and love, man.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.479 align:middle line:90%
So actually, I remember a time.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King talked
about politics and love

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.445 align:middle line:90%
in the same breath.

00:18:48.445 --> 00:18:49.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Bobby Kennedy
talked about love and politics

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:90%
in the same breath.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the politics
has been so oversecularized

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and made so dry and so
separate from human values

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:90%
is the aberration.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.327 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:19:02.327 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that people who
don't remember the other

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
might not know that.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking about a return
to a great American political

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.095 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: The
idea that some people

00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
might project onto people
like us, we're naive.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
My response to that
is that anybody

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
who thinks we can continue on
this planet and civilization

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
as we know it for
another 100 or 200 years

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and not get back to some
fundamentals of brotherhood,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
justice, and love,
they're naive.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And for the people who
would say that we're just

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of lightweight
thinkers, I

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
would say to the so-called
serious thinkers,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.775 align:middle line:84%
look at the state
of the world today.

00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If this is the state that the
so-called serious thinkers have

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
brought us to, let's let
them take a rest for a while.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's a
lot of upside down thinking

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.837 align:middle line:84%
that it's time for us to
simply realize and forge ahead.

00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's actually
perfect that I'm

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.086 align:middle line:84%
asking these questions
because it's just

00:19:56.086 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
like the environmental movement.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
You want to stick
your head in the sand

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's so daunting,
and it's not here right now.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It'll be here in 100 years.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to
worry about that.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, then actually that
gets to be 50 years.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that gets to be your
children's 50th birthday.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then that gets to--
it gets closer and closer

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:90%
and closer to home.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And then we realize we're in it.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the stage that
I've gone through, personally.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And now that I'm
talking with you,

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I realize that I have had my
head in the sand for a while

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of these issues.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not afraid to
admit that because I

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:90%
think most Americans have.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I interview them all the
time, and I speak with them

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:90%
on the radio all the time.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It's where we need to wake up.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.212 align:middle line:84%
It's you who will enlighten
us to these issues.

00:20:36.212 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get
back to that point

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
about the personal
freedoms being taken away

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
because we got sidetracked
onto money a little bit.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
What type of other freedoms
do we not know about?

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, something
that is a hot topic today

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and for good reason is this
whole idea of the NSA spying.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.997 align:middle line:84%
The president has said
that we may, we may--

00:20:54.997 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe he said this.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We may stop spying on the
leaders of allied countries.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And the president is saying
that he didn't know--

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.535 align:middle line:84%
he had assured us that the
NSA was not going that far.

00:21:06.535 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So either he knew
and he's lying,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.034 align:middle line:90%
or he honestly didn't know.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Either way, it's disturbing.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
spying on our emails,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
spying on our phone
calls, and all of that--

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people say,
well, if this is

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:90%
what it takes to keep us safe.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But I say part of my security
is some sense of privacy.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
If I know that a governmental
function is checking my emails,

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
it's going to, by
definition, make me

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:90%
more careful in what I write.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It's going to narrow--

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
this is a very, very
serious subject.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We also have things like the
National Defense Authorization

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Act, which made it possible to
arrest Americans on basically

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
just because they think you
might have done something.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.497 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of things, these
kinds of civil liberties issues

00:21:58.497 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:84%
are extremely important
because what's

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
happening is that there is a
way that the system is saying,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
we have to do this to keep
you safe from terrorism.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But then the question becomes,
when will that no longer

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:90%
be a reason?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's all about
the American citizens

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
being awake, having a
healthy skepticism so

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that the government knows
that we're watching,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
so that it will be an
appropriate balance and not

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
just what many of us feel is
an overreaching on their part.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But do you really
feel, as a congressperson,

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that you could penetrate
those systems that

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:90%
are set up by the government?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
one congressperson.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.294 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm going
to have a magic wand.

00:22:31.294 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:90%
There are 435 congresspeople.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like if I win, I
go in with a magic wand, voila,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.553 align:middle line:90%
things will be different.

00:22:36.553 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But
the conversation--

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
you and I know a
conversation matters.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
listen to your show.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
conversation in their head

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
because of the new conversation
they heard on your show.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there are
many people in Congress already

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
who would love to have
a new conversation,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
having a difficult time because
the system itself mitigates

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
against it.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we have to do is
stand in possibility thinking,

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.499 align:middle line:84%
stand within a
possibility conversation

00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:90%
in the halls of Congress.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.799 align:middle line:84%
We can't just do
it on the outside.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.173 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
have said to me,

00:23:06.173 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
are you just trying to
start a conversation?

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, I've been helping start
a conversation for 30 years.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:10%
If all I want to do is
have a conversation,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:10%
I don't need to run for office.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:10%
This is about having
that conversation

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:10%
in that city, in that
building, in those chairs.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.904 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you looked
at the big money

00:23:21.904 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:90%
interests that are in there.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
the GMO initiative.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.604 align:middle line:84%
It did not go through because
of major money influence.

00:23:27.604 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara Boxer, who is
obviously a California senator,

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
has proposed the bill in
the Senate about labeling.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
There need to be more and more
congressional voices supporting

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.410 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier, until we
get the money out of politics,

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:90%
not going to happen.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is the
biggest issue of all.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And maybe getting
the money out of politics

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%
will never happen either.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: No, no, no.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.914 align:middle line:90%
No, no, don't even say that.

00:23:48.914 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
That's like somebody
saying, well,

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.455 align:middle line:84%
maybe it won't ever happen
that we abolish slavery.

00:23:52.455 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
No, it will happen.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what I mean, it
will never completely go away.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, we want
to have an appropriate--

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what I'm saying
is that this is a stairstep

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
approach, is that
what you're doing here

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
is you're introducing
the conversation.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It's getting deeper,
it's getting deeper.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's starting
to make an impact,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
like the GMO initiative did.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
wait a minute.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We're already further
into that conversation

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.935 align:middle line:90%
than you might think.

00:24:11.935 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We had the open
primaries in California,

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.607 align:middle line:84%
that effort in California,
in Iowa, and Florida.

00:24:16.607 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.398 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: People
are facing the issue

00:24:19.398 --> 00:24:21.802 align:middle line:84%
of the politicized
gerrymandering.

00:24:21.802 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Some places like New
York City is already

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
working with one system about
public financing of campaigns.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
There is a conversation,
fair and equal,

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
a move to amend, as
well as in Congress

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
about a constitutional
amendment.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I'm going to
go in and start a conversation.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I want my voice to contribute to
a conversation that is already

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think the most sober
appraisal of this issue

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is not, well, that
will never happen.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
The sober appraisal
of that issue

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is that we must take
a move legislatively

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to get the money
out of politics,

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:90%
or we will lose our democracy.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.372 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You're the best person
to ask about this,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
because how long did it take
to end the women's suffrage

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:90%
movement?

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long did it take
to end or abolish slavery,

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:06.382 align:middle line:90%
how long?

00:25:06.382 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: These things
do not happen overnight.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They take years.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.482 align:middle line:84%
You look at someone like
Susan B. Anthony, devoted

00:25:12.482 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
her whole life to
women's suffrage.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And she herself died before the
passage of the 19th Amendment

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:90%
in 1921.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The point is that even though it
takes a while, it's not like--

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a constitutional amendment
is a long process,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but there are interim steps
to that, such as those

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned, such as the
American anti-corruption

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:90%
project that is going on.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:84%
The more of us get involved
in the conversation,

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
know what's happening
on the state levels,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
know what's happening, I believe
this is the moral challenge

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.867 align:middle line:90%
of our life.

00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the moral
challenge of our lifetime.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:84%
If we do not get the
corrupt influence

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
of money out of our politics,
we are losing democracy.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that's an overstatement.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think any
serious person sees it

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.124 align:middle line:90%
as an overstatement.

00:25:58.124 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
obviously the people

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
do not who came to the
announcement that you made.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.473 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at this short clip

00:26:03.473 --> 00:26:05.507 align:middle line:84%
that we have of 12
minutes of applause

00:26:05.507 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
when Marianne made her
announcement that she

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:90%
was running for Congress.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.047 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:10.955 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I am
officially a candidate

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
for a seat in the US House of
Representatives, California

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.340 align:middle line:90%
District 33.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.724 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so what area
does your district cover?

00:26:34.724 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:90%
What does District 33 cover?

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.931 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, you
start up north at Malibu.

00:26:37.931 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:10%
It goes all the way down
to Rancho Palos Verdes.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:10%
So that goes through Venice
and Santa Monica and Manhattan

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Beach and Redondo Beach and
all of those places like that.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:10%
Then you come east.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:10%
You've got Pacific Palisades,
Brentwood, part of Westwood,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:10%
Beverly Hills, Bel
Air, and all the way

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.160 align:middle line:10%
into a little bit in
there, all the way east,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:10%
all the way at one
point to La Brea.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.267 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big
district, but I think

00:27:00.267 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
it's an exciting district.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.237 align:middle line:84%
I think some of the most
creative people in our country

00:27:04.237 --> 00:27:05.153 align:middle line:90%
live in this district.

00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
progressive district.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah, and
it's a district that's

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
not only progressive
politically,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:90%
it's progressive spiritually.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:90%
It's progressive--

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.491 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Creatively.

00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:12.406 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:27:12.406 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Many people are involved
in the kinds of ideas,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
read the kind of books
that we talk about

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and are really interested in
marrying the two conversations.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.159 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, I know the areas.

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Calabasas--
we were talking earlier

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
about Calabasas, Topanga Canyon.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Westlake.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So how do you
choose which issues

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.737 align:middle line:84%
to highlight in your campaign
in this particular district?

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
I'm not in this

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to do anything other
than speak my heart.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not deciding
what issues to discuss

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:84%
based on some strategic
political calculation.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about what
I care about as a woman

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and as an American.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That has guided me
throughout my career.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not changing
careers here.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.535 align:middle line:90%
I'm just extending topics.

00:27:56.535 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Speaking from my heart
has worked for me,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and I don't plan to stop that.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.065 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:04.065 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I remember
reading in an Arnold Patent book

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, if you
genuinely have something to say,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:84%
there's someone out there who
genuinely needs to hear it.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So I feel strongly
the corruption of our food

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
supply is perilous.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the chemical
companies and the big ag

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:90%
has basically interrupt--

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've changed
America's food supply,

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:90%
the food chain.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Huge, that's why there's
so many food intolerances

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.315 align:middle line:90%
and allergies.

00:28:30.315 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Mass
incarceration.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: We have
2.4 million people

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:90%
in prison in the United States.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, that's the
highest incarceration

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:84%
rate of any country
in the world,

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:84%
higher than Russia,
higher than China.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We have the highest
incarceration rate.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.070 align:middle line:90%
We have 2.4 million.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, during the 1970s, we
had 300,000 people in prison.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And out of the people in prison
in the States, 500,000 of those

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:90%
are nonviolent drug offenders.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
This whole war on drugs has been
a complete, complete failure.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It was politically motivated
from the beginning.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It has actually done
more to spread drugs

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
than to limit drugs
in this country.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:90%
It is decimated neighborhoods.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It has decimated the
relationship between people

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and law enforcement.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
legalize marijuana.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
decriminalize most other drugs.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And issues like this, you've
got your environmental issues

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
where I believe that the debate
about whether or not climate

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:90%
change is real--

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:84%
not only should this
debate be declared over,

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
but I think, as many
people do, that the issue

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
of climate change and the
perils that it represents

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:84%
are a clear and present
danger to life on Earth.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.148 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But once
again, all of this

00:29:39.148 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
underneath, getting
money out of politics.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, let's go back to
the legalization of marijuana

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:10%
and the war on drugs.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:10%
Explain to me why
you feel that that's

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:10%
the root cause of the
high incarceration rate.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.722 align:middle line:10%


00:29:52.722 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: First
of all, I'm not

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:10%
saying that the war
on drugs is the reason

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:10%
for the high incarceration rate.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Although the high incarceration
rate-- there's a woman

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.376 align:middle line:84%
named Michelle Alexander
who's written a book.

00:30:02.376 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about what
she terms "the cradle

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.879 align:middle line:90%
to prison pipeline."

00:30:07.879 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned to you earlier
about the fourth graders

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
who couldn't read.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you have the
disadvantaged communities,

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:84%
children who cannot read,
it's like a pipeline,

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
the statistical trend
towards incarceration.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But the issue on drugs had
to do-- what I was mentioning

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.622 align:middle line:84%
was the 500,000 people
who are nonviolent drug

00:30:27.622 --> 00:30:28.913 align:middle line:90%
offenders in the United States.

00:30:28.913 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you
really want somebody

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.384 align:middle line:84%
in prison for marijuana
at this point, really?

00:30:34.384 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That will
completely change the course

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.594 align:middle line:90%
of their life, completely.

00:30:37.594 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They will not be
able to get jobs.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:90%
They will not be able to--

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's
exactly right.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it would
take that system

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:90%
in a different direction.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, all of
this is a new conversation.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.554 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes
even the best--

00:30:49.554 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons I believe
independent candidacies

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.479 align:middle line:84%
like mine are so important
is because even people

00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
who are fighting the good
fight within the system

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.447 align:middle line:84%
as it is, they're still locked
in a conversation which itself

00:31:01.447 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't lead to the
real breakthroughs

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
that we need here.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.317 align:middle line:84%
It's not taking on the subjects
like mass incarceration.

00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
You have a major
conversation in the country

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:84%
about mass
incarceration, but not

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
inside the halls of Congress.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.615 align:middle line:84%
You have a major conversation
about some of these issues,

00:31:14.615 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
but not yet inside
the halls of Congress.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.444 align:middle line:84%
It's bleeding through
about food, about GMOs,

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and corruption of
the food supply.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Finally.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But not
the way it needs to.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
is because this system

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.729 align:middle line:84%
as it is, there is this illusion
of a kind of political class.

00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying to
you, we conspire with that

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:90%
by seeing ourselves as separate.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.823 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But there's
a kind of lockout.

00:31:35.823 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ways that
there is a lockout is, first

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.236 align:middle line:10%
of all, how expensive it
is to run for office, which

00:31:40.236 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:10%
is why public funding is so
necessary-- how expensive it

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:10%
is to run for office and
also who the system deems

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:10%
is qualified.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me what's fascinating
in our constitution

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is often what the
founders did not say.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Do you know, even before the
election of the president,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:10%
someone to run for president
in the United States,

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:10%
they have to be
35 or older, they

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:10%
have to have been
born here, and they

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:10%
have to have lived here
for 14 consecutive years.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.370 align:middle line:10%
The founders did
not say had to have

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:10%
been in the House
of Representatives

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:10%
for four years, had to have
been a senator at least once,

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:10%
had to have been a governor.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:10%
The founders left it
to every generation

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:10%
to determine for
themselves what skill set

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:10%
they felt was most necessary.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, the system as
it is deems somebody

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.745 align:middle line:10%
who's been in finance, somebody
who's been in government--

00:32:25.745 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Military.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Whereas they would
look at someone like yourself--

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.926 align:middle line:84%
some of the people
who are saying,

00:32:31.926 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking as a mother.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking as someone who is
concerned about the children.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking as a teacher.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking as an activist.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking as a scientist.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a lockout.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the level on
which we need to challenge

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:90%
the current system.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't put new
wine in old bottles.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We can't just keep trying
to elect candidates who are

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:90%
the best within that system.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We need to start electing
candidates who are really

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
willing to have a new
conversation because what

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
we think is what then
determines our behavior.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of an
institution, as well as

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:90%
an individual.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when
you see candidate

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.585 align:middle line:84%
that has financial manager
as opposed to candidate

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:90%
that is family budget planner.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLING] You go
towards the person that

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
tends to be more credible,
I mean, with their career.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying is to
change the conversation

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and say that this person who
is the family budget planner

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.992 align:middle line:84%
might just be as qualified
as the person who's

00:33:23.992 --> 00:33:24.825 align:middle line:90%
a financial analyst.

00:33:24.825 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's
exactly what I'm saying.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:10%
What makes them less credible?

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, why would
you be less credible?

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.495 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Really?

00:33:32.495 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING] The family
budget planner does a lot.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank
you, thank you.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:10%
Mahatma Gandhi spoke about that.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:10%
Someone who knows how
to run a household

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:10%
is someone who knows
how to run a nation.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And the fact
that we'd been made to feel

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:10%
and we've been conspired.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And as women, this
is such an issue.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:84%
We're just little--
they're sweet.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a very condescending,
patronizing attitude,

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.429 align:middle line:84%
like you don't know,
from people who

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:90%
have gotten us to where we are.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Who is it who doesn't know here?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It's generational change
that you're talking about here

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.270 align:middle line:10%
that we're going through.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.275 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, we
have to speed it up now.

00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
speeding it up, yes.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.526 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's
been long enough now.

00:34:03.526 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I think women-- women, back in
1921, we got the right to vote.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And the suffragettes such
as Elizabeth Cady Stanton,

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:10%
Susan B. Anthony,
and others assumed

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.211 align:middle line:10%
we would just flood the system
as soon as we had the right.

00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
institutional change,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
just like with personal change,
sometimes the external change

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:84%
happens, but then
takes time for us

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.329 align:middle line:84%
to emotionally and
psychologically inhabit

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:90%
the space of that change.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's time
for American women

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
not just to have certain
powers, but to own those powers.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And that begins by when you said
to me earlier today something

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.366 align:middle line:84%
like, politics is
outside your element.

00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.785 align:middle line:84%
And I said, never
say that again.

00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.677 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Politics
is everybody's business.

00:34:40.677 --> 00:34:43.739 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: As I see you stepping
up in your role as a leader,

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:10%
I am able to mirror
that myself and step up.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:10%
So you are serving
as an example to many

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:10%
in stepping up outside
of their comfort zone

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.679 align:middle line:10%
into something that they
really do know about

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:10%
and are poised to do.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:90%
So you're--

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's my
hope for this campaign.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --a wonderful
representative that way.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you, Lisa.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's my hope, is that many
people will feel enrolled here.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.780 align:middle line:10%
Because this is so much
bigger than one woman getting

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:10%
elected to Congress.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:10%
This is a sea change having
to do with many people seeing

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:10%
things differently, knowing
that this is an effort all of us

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.439 align:middle line:10%
are making for really a new
politics in the United States.

00:35:16.439 --> 00:35:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you have
quite a lot of supporters,

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:90%
as we saw in that one clip.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know that in this
particular movement

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.999 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness media, I know
that you have always been very

00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:90%
well received in this movement.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've always
spoken your truth.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I've seen you many,
many different times

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:90%
over the last decade.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
In a media
conference, I saw you.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.905 align:middle line:84%
And you came up and you
said, this is all BS.

00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.457 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.457 --> 00:35:41.040 align:middle line:10%
There needs to be
more women in media.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:10%
There needs to be more
aged women in media.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:10%
It was great.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
campaign fundraising,

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:10%
and how do you plan on
funding this campaign?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.984 align:middle line:10%
It's not a small project.

00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
as I said, one

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.980 align:middle line:84%
of the ways that the average
citizen is locked out

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is through how
much money it costs

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.579 align:middle line:84%
to run for office,
which will be true

00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
until we get public
financing, which is the money

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.210 align:middle line:90%
and politics issue.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm part of
this larger community,

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping I will
receive support,

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:84%
such as what I'm
receiving from you.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:84%
If everybody who reads
the kind of books

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:84%
we read who resonates with
what we're talking about here

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:90%
sends $5, I can be competitive.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.270 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And if people go
to marianneforcongress.com--

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:10%
I think sometimes
people feel, well, I

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:10%
can't give more than 25 bucks,
or I can't give more than $5,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:10%
that's fine.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do it.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Give what
in your heart feels right.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So people from all
over the country

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
who feel this is something--

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to see a
campaign like this.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.432 align:middle line:84%
I want to see a
candidacy like this.

00:36:37.432 --> 00:36:37.995 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is a
grassroots campaign.

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody who feels
that way does send at least $5,

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I can be competitive.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And it does cost
millions of dollars.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.773 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:36:46.773 --> 00:36:48.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's how
grassroots campaigns are

00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:49.614 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:36:49.614 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
That's how the GMO
campaign was started.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
That's how many of our
grassroots campaigns have been.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're getting into
Congress, which is incredible.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
you have been very

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
popular with infusing the
conversation of politics

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
into spirituality and
vice versa, spirituality

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:90%
into politics.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
here at a clip of Marianne

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:90%
talking at--

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.120 align:middle line:84%
a recent conversation
that she had at a church.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And in the
history of the United States,

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.050 align:middle line:10%
we were born of the
notion of possibility.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, that notion of
possibility that we

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.750 align:middle line:10%
could be founded as a democracy,
that we could be founded

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.841 align:middle line:10%
on a notion which is truly an
exceptional notion, that it

00:37:28.841 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:10%
didn't matter who
your parents were.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:10%
It didn't matter what
your education was.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:10%
It didn't matter
what your money was,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:10%
that we would create a context
where from our perspective,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:10%
self-actualization
would be possible.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.760 align:middle line:10%
That is what it stood
for, novus ordo seclorum,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:10%
new order of the ages.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.527 align:middle line:10%
This was not only radical.

00:37:47.527 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:10%
It was radical then.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.470 align:middle line:10%
It's radical now.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:10%
It was not only radical
in political terms.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:10%
It's radical in philosophical
and spiritual terms.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:10%
It's truly to create
a space on Earth

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.040 align:middle line:10%
to the best of our ability where
the human soul could express

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:10%
itself however it wishes.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:10%
So democracy represents
a spiritual impulse.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, from the
beginning, as we know,

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.904 align:middle line:10%
it's not news to anyone
most of the signers

00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:10%
of the Declaration
of Independence

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:10%
were themselves slave owners.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, the irony of
this was not lost on them.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:10%
Jefferson's line, "I
tremble for my country

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.040 align:middle line:10%
when I consider God is just
and that his justice shall not

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:10%
sleep forever."

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.950 align:middle line:10%
So the political narrative, the
journey of the United States

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:10%
has been and continues to be--
in this generation as much

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:10%
as any other--

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:10%
between the forces
represented by people

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:10%
who would like to limit
the actual embodiment

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.380 align:middle line:10%
or full manifestation of the
extraordinary possibilities

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:10%
of democracy versus
those who would say, no,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:10%
let's make it real.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:10%
It's not just white people.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:10%
It's not just men.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.680 align:middle line:10%
It's not just this group.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:10%
It's everybody.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:00.976 align:middle line:10%
If God created everyone equal,
if all are created equal,

00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't just mean men.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't just mean whites.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.861 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't just mean anything.

00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:07.110 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't just mean the rich.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.890 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't just mean
straight people.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.348 align:middle line:10%
And I think one of the frontiers
for American understanding

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:10%
is that we really get clearly,
it doesn't just mean Americans

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:10%
if God created everyone equal.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:10%
And so it is a
spiritual expansion

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:10%
represented by
our fuller embrace

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:10%
of what democracy actually is.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.104 align:middle line:10%
And once again,
in our generation

00:39:26.104 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:10%
as much as any other, there
are those who would say,

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.091 align:middle line:10%
whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't
want everybody voting.

00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.260 align:middle line:10%
And things like that.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:10%
We have, as we know, over
the last few decades,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.900 align:middle line:10%
through corporate subsidies,
tax breaks, et cetera--

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.194 align:middle line:10%
we have actually accumulated--
we have systematically

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:10%
taken the majority
of the material

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:10%
resources of the
country and moved

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:10%
them very systematically into
what represents basically

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:10%
the hands of the very few so
that we now have 1% controlling

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.726 align:middle line:10%
42% of our wealth.

00:39:56.726 --> 00:39:58.850 align:middle line:10%
When we think of the first
principles of the United

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:10%
States, we think of
the Constitution.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:10%
We think of the
Declaration of Independence

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:09.580 align:middle line:10%
and also Lincoln's famous adage
in the Gettysburg Address,

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:10%
that these men at Gettysburg
had not died in vain,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:10%
but so that there could
be a rebirth of freedom,

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:10%
and then his extraordinary
phrase that government

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:10%
of the people, by the
people, and for the people

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:10%
would not perish from the earth.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think it's really
important for all of us

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.110 align:middle line:10%
to be very clear.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:10%
If we are going to change the
social agreement in the United

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:10%
States of America from
government of the people,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:10%
by the people,
and for the people

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.649 align:middle line:10%
to government of a few of the
people, by a few of the people,

00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:10%
for a few of the people, we need
to have a debate about that.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.160 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Since you are at the
forefront of infusing politics

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
together, how do you

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:84%
propose to bring that
conversation into Congress?

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
spirituality is simply the quest

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:90%
for living from the heart.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
our political system,

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
with our civilization
is that we are

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
ordered according to
economic principle rather

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:90%
than humanitarian values.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We make money rather than
love the bottom line.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.417 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
undue influence

00:41:17.417 --> 00:41:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of money on our system,
because of the flood

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of corporate lobbyists and
other wealthy individuals who

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.820 align:middle line:84%
are able to affect our
system the way they are,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to be someone--

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and there are
others, by the way.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.906 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there aren't
people in the US Congress today

00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:84%
who are standing up for
humanitarian values,

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.860 align:middle line:90%
because there are.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.340 align:middle line:10%
I want, however, to add my
voice in the most passionate way

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:10%
to those who are saying
that the moneyed interests

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.380 align:middle line:10%
of a small sector of
our society should not

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.332 align:middle line:10%
be placed over the
interests of our children

00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:46.790 align:middle line:10%
who need to go to preschool,
our children who need a better

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:10%
education, our children
who need quality food that

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:10%
is uncorrupted by GMOs, by our
children who need quality air.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an
example of something

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:90%
that I found just shocking.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We have no air quality
safety standards

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:90%
in our public schools, Lisa.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And 40% of all teachers and
students at our public schools

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:84%
are already known to
be adversely affected

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:84%
in their respiratory
systems, asthma, et cetera.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So we continue to give
subsidies and tax breaks

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to the wealthiest
Americans, which

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is sucking money and economic
resources out of our budget

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.537 align:middle line:84%
that we could be using on
taking care of our people.

00:42:31.537 --> 00:42:33.870 align:middle line:10%
That's what Lincoln meant by
a government of the people,

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.849 align:middle line:10%
by the people, and for
the people, this idea

00:42:35.849 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:10%
that if we give the
money to the very rich,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:10%
that that will create jobs.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just an illusion.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not even true.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The people who say it
know it's not true.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Because jobs come
from the middle

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.770 align:middle line:84%
class, people who are
thriving in their lives.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
jobs in America come

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:84%
from situations like yours,
where you had this television

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:90%
situation, a radio station.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
This is where jobs
are created from.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean, I
also think about OSHA,

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the environmental
organization that does go in.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know some
people who work for OSHA.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're, again,
middle class,

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:90%
working citizens, hardworking.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:84%
One particularly has
an autistic child.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a situation where
those people are trying to make

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and penetrate the systems
that they sometimes cannot get

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.980 align:middle line:90%
through to.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly right,
because a lot of these--

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.810 align:middle line:84%
it was Richard Nixon who set
up the Environmental Protection

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.578 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was a
Republican president.

00:43:25.578 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the '60s, yeah.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But the country
has gone so far to the right

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.760 align:middle line:84%
now that what used to be the
right is now the far right,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and what used to be the left
in governmental functioning

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:90%
is pretty centrist.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these agencies
that were actually set up

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.170 align:middle line:84%
with the purpose of
advocating for the people

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.930 align:middle line:84%
against the excesses
of certain industries

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.210 align:middle line:84%
now consider themselves
as having a dual role

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:84%
at best and sometimes almost
completely to advocate

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:90%
for those industries.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The government needs
to work for the people.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a change
in the basic social contract

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.216 align:middle line:84%
that every American has
the right to expect.

00:44:00.216 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's government of
the people, by the people,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and for the people.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you used
to be a Democrat.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.531 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've swung towards the
center, the Independent Party.

00:44:07.531 --> 00:44:09.488 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I've been
a Democrat all my life.

00:44:09.488 --> 00:44:11.597 align:middle line:10%
And if I win, I will
caucus with Democrats.

00:44:11.597 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:10%
I have a Democrat's heart.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.930 align:middle line:10%
But I gotta tell you something.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:10%
We have got to have
a new conversation

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.740 align:middle line:10%
now because it's
become so corrupted,

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Republican versus Democrat.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.907 align:middle line:10%
And the things that
upset me about money,

00:44:23.907 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm concerned about
some of the places

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:10%
where they're way
too much the same.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think if we have
20 independent candidates, if we

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.340 align:middle line:84%
have 20 independent congressmen
in the US House, that

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.538 align:middle line:90%
will change everything.

00:44:35.538 --> 00:44:36.746 align:middle line:90%
So I believe that right now--

00:44:36.746 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How many are there now?

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
there aren't any.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.450 align:middle line:84%
There are two independent
senators, Bernie Sanders

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and Angus King.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:84%
If we have independent
voices-- and there's

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
nothing about in our
constitution about two parties.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.570 align:middle line:90%
You know what I always say?

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
In some countries, they have
only two brands of toothpaste,

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but 14 brands of
political party.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:84%
In our country, we
have so much choice

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to toothpaste
and sneakers and T-shirts.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like we're not really--

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:10%
hello.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:10%
It's not really penetrating
that even though we

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.180 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of brands
of toothpaste,

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:10%
we only have two brands
of political voice.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, every election
you see the red states

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:10%
and blue states,
the red states--

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.486 align:middle line:10%
and you don't see
the green states.

00:45:13.486 --> 00:45:15.777 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And yet, there's
something coming up from

00:45:15.777 --> 00:45:17.380 align:middle line:10%
the bottom of things,
from our hearts,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:10%
from our subconscious that wants
to have a conversation separate

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.130 align:middle line:10%
from the one either one
of them are having--

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.900 align:middle line:10%
a new kind of synthesis,
a new kind of bottom line,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:10%
a new kind of stepping into
a vision and possibility

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:10%
that that system
does not account for.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So abolition didn't come
from a major political party.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Women's suffragettes didn't come
from a major political party.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Social security didn't even come
from a major political party.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So often in the
history of the United

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:84%
States and our major
movements forward,

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
it was movements
that did not come

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:90%
through the political parties.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Came from the people, and
then the political parties

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
came along.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.083 align:middle line:84%
For us to expect the
political parties to lead us,

00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to really deliver us to the new
conversation, is naive at best.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If anyone
could do it, you

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
could because you are
steeped in that conversation.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I don't
know if I can, but we can.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, good point.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.883 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:46:04.883 --> 00:46:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you do get
into Congress--

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and I should say when you get
into Congress-- what would

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.050 align:middle line:90%
you do?

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would
be your first step,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and where would you start
if you got into this seat?

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.276 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, as I
said, what I will be saying

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:84%
throughout this campaign and
if I have the honor of being

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.410 align:middle line:84%
elected, I will certainly
live up to what I'm saying--

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I will become involved
with everything

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.540 align:middle line:84%
possible having to do with
the interim steps, all the way

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
up to and including the move
for a constitutional amendment

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to get the influence of
money out of our politics.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:10%
And I will have a
platform that I will not

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:10%
have if I'm not elected,
both within the Congress,

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.530 align:middle line:10%
as well as throughout
the community,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:10%
in the country, the people
that I can talk to about that.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The derivative
issues, of course,

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:48.674 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
mass incarceration,

00:46:48.674 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
corruption of our food supply,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.220 align:middle line:84%
having to do with preschool,
having to do with free college.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You have one major
political party

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.955 align:middle line:84%
who just doesn't want
help these kids at all.

00:46:58.955 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
You have another major
political party trying

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:90%
to lower the interest rates.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I think there should be free
college in this country.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.266 align:middle line:84%
Oregon is already-- for
the capable students

00:47:08.266 --> 00:47:09.890 align:middle line:84%
who live up to the
standards necessary.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.855 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Isn't that what
financial aid does?

00:47:11.855 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: No, financial aid,
still you have to pay it back.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Oregon has
already created a system

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:22.550 align:middle line:10%
where we could enable
the kids who deserve it,

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:10%
who worked for it, who
are keeping up that,

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.180 align:middle line:10%
and then the system,
for instance, I

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.600 align:middle line:10%
think that Oregon is trying
has to do with a 2% or 3%

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.330 align:middle line:10%
that they would pay back, paying
it forward when they leave.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I see.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON:
Because if you really

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:10%
want to stimulate
your economy, what you

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:10%
want more than anything
is more educated people.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Education, yes, yes.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.280 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And more
people who come out of school

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.870 align:middle line:10%
ready to form their
own $6 million

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.713 align:middle line:10%
company if they
put out the effort.

00:47:44.713 --> 00:47:46.254 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
way of our future.

00:47:46.254 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I think these
are the kinds of conversations

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.306 align:middle line:90%
that I will be having.

00:47:48.306 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And now, what about
the Department of Peace?

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:10%
Is it currently in place?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, yes.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.020 align:middle line:10%
When Dennis Kucinich
was a congressman,

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:10%
he started the Department of
Peace campaign legislation.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is now taken
over by Barbara Lee.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It is now called the
Department of Peace building.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly be a
sponsor of that bill.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important bill that
I've been part of the campaign

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.630 align:middle line:90%
to support that for years now.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It would be an executive
branch department

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that articulates and
facilitates and researches

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.430 align:middle line:84%
nonviolent problem
solving options

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.880 align:middle line:84%
for both domestic and
international conflict.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we have the
Defense Department,

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.716 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
State Department.

00:48:29.716 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:10%
The Defense Department
could be likened

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.200 align:middle line:10%
to visiting your surgeon.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:10%
If you need an invasive
surgery, you go to your doctor.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:41.150 align:middle line:10%
So if we feel that invasive
military measures are the best,

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:42.980 align:middle line:10%
you would go to the
Defense Department.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.870 align:middle line:10%
But what we all know
now is you don't just

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.170 align:middle line:10%
rush to your surgeon.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You find out first, is there
any other way I could fix this?

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Preventative
medicine, yes.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:51.723 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes, preventative.

00:48:51.723 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:90%
How could nutrition help?

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.680 align:middle line:84%
How could psychological
issues help?

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.240 align:middle line:10%
We have a holistic paradigm now.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We need that in
politics as well.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So the president
should be consulted

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.600 align:middle line:84%
by those who have scoured
the country for the best

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.440 align:middle line:84%
practices, techniques having
to do with nonviolent options.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, the state
people say, what

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:08.960 align:middle line:90%
about the State Department?

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But the State
Department, first of all,

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.570 align:middle line:84%
only deals with
international conflict.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Department of Peace would
be domestic, as well as

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.430 align:middle line:90%
international.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.335 align:middle line:84%
And also, the diplomatic
efforts of the State Department

00:49:19.335 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is very important as they are,
which should be increased,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.170 align:middle line:84%
by the way, much
more well funded.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Still have to do with
government to government.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And the healing, Lisa,
is people to people.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So what are the
ways that we can dismantle--

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Franklin Roosevelt said we
need to do more than end war.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We need to end the
beginnings of all wars.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So what the holistic
paradigm and also

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.030 align:middle line:84%
the transformational
community is well versed

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:84%
in is the idea
that you can't just

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:84%
wait for a symptom to
erupt and then just try

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.500 align:middle line:90%
to eradicate it or suppress it.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:84%
You deal with causal
issues of disease,

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and we must deal with causal
issues of social disease

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.080 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.083 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: There's no reason
not to expect desperate people

00:50:00.083 --> 00:50:01.190 align:middle line:10%
to do desperate things.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Large groups of desperate people
are a national security risk.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:10%
So for us to address
desperate people,

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.385 align:middle line:10%
to address the issues
of hunger, to address

00:50:11.385 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:10%
the issues of hopelessness,
to address the issues of lack

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:10%
of financial opportunity--
this is not just

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.840 align:middle line:10%
some bleeding heart nice thing.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.660 align:middle line:84%
This is about taking care of our
own country and our own world,

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.042 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, the eruption
of violence in those situations

00:50:24.042 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more and more
reasonable to expect.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're
functioning here

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.050 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
systemic problems

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.374 align:middle line:90%
rather than the symptoms.

00:50:31.374 --> 00:50:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And that's
the new conversation.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The old conversation is
all about the symptoms.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.205 align:middle line:84%
And the new conversation
is a systemic healing.

00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Same with
medicine, absolutely.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Same thing.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely, yes.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this question.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.170 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
you don't get elected?

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:90%
How will you continue on?

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I feel a calling
in my heart to do this,

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:90%
to run this race.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running it with all
intention and commitment

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to doing what I can to winning.

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.654 align:middle line:84%
And in democracy, the
people will decide,

00:50:58.654 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it should be.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no guarantee.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you have an election
where the end is guaranteed,

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:90%
that's called totalitarian.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.200 align:middle line:90%
It's called a rigged system.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally fine that
the people will decide.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe very strongly
that if we do this well,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.400 align:middle line:84%
if enough of us who
resonate with these ideas

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:84%
are involved in this campaign
and work this campaign,

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.200 align:middle line:84%
we will create
something beautiful.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And then what we are to
do with that energy--

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:84%
if I win, we know what
we're to do with the energy.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:29.340 align:middle line:84%
If we do not win
this particular race,

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.180 align:middle line:84%
the same calling of the heart
that has directed us to do this

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:90%
will direct us what to do next.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:90%
But this thing is happening.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:84%
This revolution of thought
has already happened.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It's already saturated other
areas of our civilization,

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and it is going to saturate
politics because so many of us

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.810 align:middle line:84%
are waking up to
the need for it.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.430 align:middle line:84%
This government can't even
keep the government open.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And people know it's
time to try another way.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As I said, by just
having this conversation,

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.515 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion,
you've already won

00:51:57.515 --> 00:51:59.397 align:middle line:90%
because we have a start here.

00:51:59.397 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We have somebody who
is in this position who

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.770 align:middle line:84%
is bringing this conversation
up into a political platform,

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:84%
which usually happens
on a grassroots level.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're making grassroots
the new politics.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: The
conversation and the effort.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: The
conversation and the effort.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.879 align:middle line:84%
You've always been
really good about that,

00:52:15.879 --> 00:52:18.240 align:middle line:84%
is paying attention to the
specific things that I say

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.212 align:middle line:90%
and reforming them.

00:52:19.212 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're doing.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
I'm just saying

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.890 align:middle line:84%
if we just talk about it,
that won't win an election.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we talk about it
and then pick up the phone,

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.456 align:middle line:84%
talk about it, and then have
a house party, talk about it,

00:52:28.456 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and then send $5, talk about
it, and talk to your friends

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.460 align:middle line:90%
about it too--

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:84%
moving a little bit past
the habits that we have now.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Alexis de Tocqueville talked
about the habits of democracy.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Too many of us have lost
the habit of democracy.

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We're not putting ourselves
out there the way we might.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.362 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, we're waking
up, and we're ready to do that.

00:52:48.362 --> 00:52:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that this campaign
will be a container for that.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, this is like--

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:84%
you talk about health
from the inside out.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
This is politics
from the inside out.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's right.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because unless you are
completely firm with not having

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:01.140 align:middle line:84%
more in your own life and
more in your own household,

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.370 align:middle line:84%
you cannot go out and talk about
not having more in our country.

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's definitely something.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:84%
How do you plan on keeping up
with your own personal issues

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and physical issues
during the campaign?

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.549 align:middle line:84%
Do you plan on staying
strong and staying healthy

00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:84%
just like you're talking
about our country being?

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.048 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: As
I said, it took me

00:53:19.048 --> 00:53:21.190 align:middle line:10%
a year of deep inquiry
inside my heart.

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I hope so.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: I have a daughter.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.336 align:middle line:84%
She was very involved in
this conversation with me--

00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:27.930 align:middle line:84%
my closest friends, people
like yourself, Lisa.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:31.380 align:middle line:10%
I remember talking to you with a
group of people, really asking,

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.489 align:middle line:10%
what do you think, guys?

00:53:32.489 --> 00:53:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that there
will be the support here?

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.230 align:middle line:10%
Do you think the
energy is there?

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.257 align:middle line:90%
I explored.

00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And I feel there is.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Before we got on
here today, you were

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:45.720 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the place I
should go for herbal remedies

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:90%
for my cough.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling that.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:51.960 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Enough of us feel like, OK,
my life is together enough.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm also thinking
about those around me

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.303 align:middle line:84%
and the people who are
doing the things I support.

00:53:59.303 --> 00:54:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm taking in the love
of friends and family

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and supporters,
and doing my best

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.800 align:middle line:90%
and will continue to do so.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we will
always be here.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for being here.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.781 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is
a huge contribution.

00:54:17.781 --> 00:54:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you, Lisa.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there
anything that you

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
want to say, in
terms of parting,

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.049 align:middle line:84%
that you can direct
people to do?

00:54:23.049 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: All I
would say is that there

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.510 align:middle line:10%
was one thing you said to
me on this program, which

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.490 align:middle line:10%
was the pivotal factor.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:33.540 align:middle line:10%
You said something like, we were
in a stupor, but we're not now.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I was asleep to something,
and I'm not now.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, had
my head in the sand.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's it.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:40.858 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's just
that tweet from my head

00:54:40.858 --> 00:54:42.330 align:middle line:84%
was in the sand,
and it's not now.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I tend to
be a very aware person.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Hello.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:90%
You're aware, so.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:49.812 align:middle line:90%


00:54:49.812 --> 00:54:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Still have
politics out, no more.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: No more.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Not that one.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.789 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm just going to
talk about what I know about

00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:90%
and not branch out.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a scary conversation.

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: My mother said to
me once-- my late mother said,

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.808 align:middle line:84%
you're the only person I know
who put save democracy on her

00:55:03.808 --> 00:55:05.670 align:middle line:90%
to do list.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us need to
put save democracy on our

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.840 align:middle line:90%
to do list.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.784 align:middle line:84%
And that's
marianneforcongress.com.

00:55:11.784 --> 00:55:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right underneath

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.820 align:middle line:84%
As long as it's not underneath
mani and pedi this week.

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.994 align:middle line:90%


00:55:19.994 --> 00:55:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope you continue to
support yourself while you're

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.560 align:middle line:90%
supporting us and the country.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.713 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we will
continue to support you.

00:55:25.713 --> 00:55:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Your prayers are appreciated.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And before and
after the campaign,

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%
as this interview will
continue to last beyond,

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.030 align:middle line:84%
you have served as an
inspiration to many of us

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:37.611 align:middle line:90%
just by stepping up.

00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just by being here.

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.254 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what I'm talking
about supporting you for,

00:55:42.254 --> 00:55:45.450 align:middle line:84%
is your initiative,
your being present,

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.511 align:middle line:84%
your willing to be a leader and
step out of your comfort zone

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to be a leader, which actually
looks like your comfort zone.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.915 align:middle line:90%
So you're fine.

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, that's where
the magic happens, outside.

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, this is stepping
out of my comfort zone

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:56.330 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the
magic happens when

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.120 align:middle line:90%
you step up to be a leader.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what this show is
all about, is stepping up to be

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.050 align:middle line:90%
a leader.

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:04.951 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:06.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: God
bless you, honey.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You too.

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:08.500 align:middle line:90%
