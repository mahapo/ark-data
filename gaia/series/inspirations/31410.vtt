>> Lisa Garr: Hi I'm Lisa Garr
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.927 align:middle line:84%
Once and for all would you
like to help solve the mystery

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.597 align:middle line:84%
about the communication
between men and women?

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to know
why women just can't relax

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.702 align:middle line:84%
until certain things are
cleaned and out away?

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.038 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to know why
women multitask and men look

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.206 align:middle line:84%
at us like we're
crazy [laughter]?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.776 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to
know the top three things

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:44.645 align:middle line:84%
that women are doing
that is absolutely wrong

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.046 align:middle line:90%
with men [laughter]?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.683 align:middle line:84%
Well joining me today is Alison
Armstrong, thank God [laughter].

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:53.821 align:middle line:84%
She has spent the last 20 years
educating men and women on how

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.024 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and
master the relationships

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:90%
between each other.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.294 align:middle line:84%
Welcome. Thank you for
being here [laughter].

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Oh I'm
really happy to be here.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh we're very
grateful too because you have

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.202 align:middle line:84%
such clear communication skills
when it comes to this mystery

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.542 align:middle line:84%
How did you get started on your
path of studying men and women?

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:15.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well,

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:84%
the very short version
is I was 30-years-old.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:25.885 align:middle line:84%
I'd been married and
divorced and a friend

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.623 align:middle line:84%
of mine asked a man, "Why
is it that men are great

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:34.295 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning and then
turn into sports watching,

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.464 align:middle line:84%
beer belching, pizza eating,
couch slugs [laughter]?"

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
what she said?

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:40.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yeah [laughter].

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Nice.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.836 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Uh-huh.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And there
were about 200 of us there.

00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:48.108 align:middle line:84%
We were all really
interested in the answer

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.244 align:middle line:90%
to that and his name is Herb.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:51.378 align:middle line:90%
He answered the question.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Oh I see,
you're a frog farmer."

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: A frog farmer?

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:58.852 align:middle line:90%
Weird answer to that question.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.587 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:00.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:02.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And he went
on to explain a frog farmer.

00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:07.094 align:middle line:84%
He said some women turn
frogs into princes.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:08.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: You my
dear turn princes into frogs.

00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:12.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Frogs.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.602 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that wouldn't
make someone feel good.

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:16.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: No, no
she actually stuck her tongue

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:18.205 align:middle line:90%
out at him [laughter].

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:21.008 align:middle line:84%
After he turned around she
stuck her tongue out at him.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.711 align:middle line:84%
She completely deflected
the remark.

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.745 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame her.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.213 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty harsh.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:84%
But it bounced off
of her and hit me.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.586 align:middle line:84%
And I had this vision of
this big white farm house

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:37.458 align:middle line:84%
with a wraparound porch and I
was standing out on the front

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:41.128 align:middle line:84%
of the porch and there were rows
and rows of frogs [laughter]

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.463 align:middle line:84%
with little human
heads [laughter].

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:45.266 align:middle line:84%
And there was my
ex-husband [laughter]

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.668 align:middle line:90%
and all my ex-boyfriends.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:48.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And it struck me

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:53.139 align:middle line:90%
that I was a frog farmer.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.542 align:middle line:84%
That I was a very
successful frog farmer.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: A
very effective frog farmer.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.481 align:middle line:84%
I could -- I literally
could bring out the worst

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.549 align:middle line:90%
in men in about 10 days.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But
the thing that shifted

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:10.057 align:middle line:84%
in that moment is up till then I
was proud of it because what --

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.293 align:middle line:90%
I thought men were con-artists.

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:14.395 align:middle line:90%
And so I was going to drill in

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:18.599 align:middle line:84%
and reveal the con before I got
sucked in again, to their charm.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
be right about it.

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:20.801 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:22.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I was going to find

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:24.972 align:middle line:84%
out what jerks they were before
I fell in love with them.

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:27.007 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
in that moment is what

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.943 align:middle line:84%
if I actually was
antagonizing them?

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:33.747 align:middle line:84%
What if I was bringing
out the jerk?

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.382 align:middle line:84%
That it wasn't so
close to the surface.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.351 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't who they
naturally were.

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:38.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh, it was...

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
that's when I discovered it.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.488 align:middle line:90%
I started studying men.

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:44.824 align:middle line:84%
That men are both princes and
frogs and we have a lot to do

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:47.127 align:middle line:90%
with which one we get.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And so you
have an amazing amount

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.999 align:middle line:90%
of compassion for men don't you.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: I do.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.868 align:middle line:90%
I went from -- I hated them.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I
mean just to be frank.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:58.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
A lot of women do.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.673 align:middle line:90%
A lot of women don't.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:01.742 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women are merely
frustrated with them,

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.277 align:middle line:90%
or disappointed, or hurt.

00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a lot of that and I
hated them but didn't know it.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.519 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would
take two or three months

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.655 align:middle line:84%
to learn everything that was
worth knowing about them,

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:18.392 align:middle line:84%
because I -- like a lot of women
I thought men were shallow.

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:21.195 align:middle line:84%
And so I started out with
very little commitment.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:23.464 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know what
was I doing that was bringing

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
out the worst and maybe I could
learn a couple little tricks

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.535 align:middle line:90%
that would bring out the best.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.538 align:middle line:84%
And it was very much from the
point of view of manipulation.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
How could I -- if I could
understand them better I could

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.641 align:middle line:90%
manipulate them better.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.311 align:middle line:90%
It was all adversarial.

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:40.814 align:middle line:84%
All know thy enemy to get
a better result [laughter].

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:44.218 align:middle line:90%
And now -- that was 1991.

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:48.622 align:middle line:84%
Right? So now all these years
later I am still studying them.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.458 align:middle line:90%
I'm fascinated by them.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.562 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised when -- even
this weekend I was surprised

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.532 align:middle line:84%
by something I learned
new about men.

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:84%
And I've become their
biggest fan.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I adore them.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
I'm in awe, absolute
awe of who men are.

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:08.876 align:middle line:84%
I think men are God's
gift to women.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.179 align:middle line:84%
We just need to understand
how they work.

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: And...

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:17.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And they -- men
want more women like you saying,

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.855 align:middle line:84%
"Yes [laughter] we are and
can somebody just appreciate

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.223 align:middle line:90%
it [laughter]."

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah, we
actually have men who go --

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:27.694 align:middle line:84%
who will only date the
graduates of our workshops.

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh
[laughter] that makes sense.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And this
is a requirement for them.

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.799 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to do anything else?

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: The
distinctions are so clear.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.169 align:middle line:90%
So what is the biggest complaint

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.705 align:middle line:84%
that you hear from
women about men?

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:39.807 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what you
were just saying.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.208 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
there's several of them.

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:49.983 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to see men as being
slow, or clueless, or stupid.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.919 align:middle line:84%
Like they don't catch
on to what's needed.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.888 align:middle line:90%
They don't act fast enough.

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:90%
They complain that they have

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.926 align:middle line:84%
to do everything while
he's sitting on the couch.

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:01.728 align:middle line:84%
So there's problems -- they
complain about accountability.

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:04.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Just doing
a single thing at a time?

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
they do one thing at a time.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.534 align:middle line:90%
Yes. For good reason.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.838 align:middle line:84%
But to a woman that seems
stupid and slow and inefficient.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:11.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, right.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:12.673 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:13.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
They complain

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.476 align:middle line:90%
that men won't communicate.

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:18.479 align:middle line:84%
That it's hard to get more
than one word out of them.

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.349 align:middle line:84%
They -- you know, the term
emotionally unavailable.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.453 align:middle line:84%
So women have trouble
connecting with men

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:29.289 align:middle line:84%
at a real heartfelt
level and they struggle

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.124 align:middle line:90%
with that and they feel hurt.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.993 align:middle line:84%
Like they think that
men either can't connect

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.261 align:middle line:84%
or don't want to
connect with them.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:36.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
they're not able to.

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:36.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: What about men?

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:41.969 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest complaint
you hear men saying about women?

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Well thanks?

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.138 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, represent that
side too [laughter].

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:52.212 align:middle line:84%
So men complain that women
expect them to read their minds.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.883 align:middle line:84%
And that women -- well
the way they say it is

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:57.484 align:middle line:90%
that you can't win.

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.686 align:middle line:90%
They can't win with women.

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Hmm-mm.

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: If they
don't do something absolutely

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:84%
perfectly they get
no points at all.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So
the way women said it,

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:08.428 align:middle line:84%
"How can I get 100
points or no points?

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.398 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I just get 80 points?"

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:12.065 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Right?

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So they
complain about how we focus

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.503 align:middle line:84%
on what was wrong
instead of what was right.

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:19.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Or we do over what
they did thinking it was fine

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.608 align:middle line:90%
and we had to have it perfect.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:23.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:26.413 align:middle line:84%
And their biggest
complaint really would boil

00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:30.417 align:middle line:84%
down to all the ways
that we emasculate them.

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't let them be the man.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.522 align:middle line:90%
We try to be the man

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:37.491 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship
while expecting them

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:39.092 align:middle line:90%
to act like a girlfriend.

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.395 align:middle line:84%
We want them to listen to
us like a girlfriend would

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:45.065 align:middle line:84%
but then we want them to be
accountable and be a provider...

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:46.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...ambitious and all

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:47.568 align:middle line:90%
that stuff like a man would.

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yup.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So that's
one of their complaints.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.038 align:middle line:84%
That they -- that we try
to have them be everything.

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:52.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well
there's a video

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.875 align:middle line:84%
that really [laughter] shows
a beautiful demonstration

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.045 align:middle line:84%
on how men and women don't
communicate very well.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: After
years of studying men

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:84%
and women I've come to realize
that a key to happy relationship

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle line:84%
with the opposite
sex is to recognize

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.657 align:middle line:90%
that we have two natures.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:14.261 align:middle line:84%
One I call human/animal,
the other human/spirit.

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:17.497 align:middle line:84%
[Background Music] Human/spirit
in the elevated part of us.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.233 align:middle line:84%
It enables us to
be our best selves.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.703 align:middle line:84%
Human/animal is the
more primitive part.

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:25.973 align:middle line:84%
The instinctive part that
lashes out often in response

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:30.344 align:middle line:84%
to a primal fear of
scarcity, or competition.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:33.614 align:middle line:84%
When that happens I call it
an attack of human/animal.

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:37.818 align:middle line:84%
It's a cavewoman
or caveman attack.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.053 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is there
is literally an eclipse

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:41.755 align:middle line:90%
of human/spirit.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:43.857 align:middle line:84%
So human/spirit is
still there but it's

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.394 align:middle line:84%
in the background overshadowed
by the animal reaction

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:52.633 align:middle line:84%
that is driven by a perception
of a threat to one's survival.

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:84%
So when men and women
perceive a threat

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:59.973 align:middle line:84%
to their survival they react by
instinct and instinct is defined

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:03.944 align:middle line:84%
as a primal, biological
urge compelling a response

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:06.246 align:middle line:90%
that brings relief of tension.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.682 align:middle line:84%
Now I bring that up because
it's a good place to look.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:13.053 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're experiencing
tension there's a very good

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.823 align:middle line:84%
chance that you're reacting
instinctively from your caveman

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
or cavewoman and not
from human/spirit.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.297 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're going to bring
out the best in ourselves

00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:25.032 align:middle line:90%
and each other we have

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:30.237 align:middle line:84%
to understand what causes
an attack of human/animal.

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.006 align:middle line:84%
And what does that is
any time that we perceive

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.042 align:middle line:84%
that our survival
is in jeopardy.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:38.445 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a threat
to our physical safety.

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:41.281 align:middle line:84%
It could be a threat to
property we're attached to.

00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:84%
It could be a threat to our
identity or our sense of self.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.055 align:middle line:84%
[Background Music] Now if we're
going to bring out the best

00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:51.992 align:middle line:84%
of each other we have to
understand that the masculine

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:55.862 align:middle line:84%
and feminine aspects of our
natures experience survival

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:59.933 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, safety and
security in different ways.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.869 align:middle line:84%
For the masculine
survival depends

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:05.338 align:middle line:84%
on one's ability
to produce results.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:09.409 align:middle line:84%
So the masculine will
feel safe and secure

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:12.446 align:middle line:84%
when they have the greatest
opportunity to produce results.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:16.616 align:middle line:84%
And that comes when they're
respected and trusted

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.218 align:middle line:90%
by the people that they work,

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
with and the people
that they care for.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.892 align:middle line:84%
The feminine on the other hand
experiences safety and security

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.562 align:middle line:90%
when she feels connected.

00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:32.866 align:middle line:84%
When she's getting the attention
and the interest she needs

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:37.871 align:middle line:84%
from the people around her that
give her a nearly constant sense

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:41.708 align:middle line:84%
of feeling connected and
therefore safe and secure.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the problems is that
men and women have instincts

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:51.184 align:middle line:84%
that literally antagonize the
others caveman or cavewoman.

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:54.387 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the way
that a man thinks --

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:58.158 align:middle line:84%
which we call single focus
will cause him to pay attention

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:90%
to one thing at a time.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.529 align:middle line:90%
So if he's watching television,

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:84%
the woman in his
life may feel ignored

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:09.302 align:middle line:84%
and she'll get this incredible
sense of tension in her body

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:11.605 align:middle line:84%
and she'll try to do
things to connect with him,

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:84%
connect with him,
connect with him,

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:16.176 align:middle line:84%
which is a single focus person
he is going to experience it

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.545 align:middle line:84%
as an interruption
and be annoyed by it

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:19.913 align:middle line:90%
and cause a downward spiral.

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:25.252 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, woman have
an instinct that causes them

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:29.523 align:middle line:84%
to want to be scrupulously
accurate in their details.

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:84%
So if a man is telling a story
and he says something happened

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.061 align:middle line:84%
on a Tuesday that
she thinks happened

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.199 align:middle line:84%
on a Wednesday she'll interrupt
him and correct that story.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
If this is in front of
other people it's going

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.604 align:middle line:90%
to cause a problem.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.741 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's someone whose
respect and trust he needs

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:50.043 align:middle line:84%
and she's now intimated
that he lies

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.513 align:middle line:84%
or exaggerates that's
going to be a problem.

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:56.783 align:middle line:84%
Now on the other hand
understanding these ways

00:11:56.783 --> 00:12:00.453 align:middle line:84%
that we antagonize each other's
instincts we can behave in a way

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.989 align:middle line:84%
that instead brings out
the best in each other.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:07.494 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for a man to
overcome his natural respect

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.497 align:middle line:84%
for privacy and instead
ask questions that show

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:14.835 align:middle line:84%
that he's interested in her
he can even ask her what her

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:17.003 align:middle line:84%
favorite questions
are to be asked.

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:21.374 align:middle line:84%
And for a woman to recognize
the tension she feels

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:24.578 align:middle line:84%
about the accuracy of
details and realize

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:26.513 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this isn't
so important,

00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:90%
just let him tell the story.

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
correct him on that

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.886 align:middle line:84%
and then he can maintain the
respect and trust that he needs.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:36.356 align:middle line:84%
By understanding the
differences in the way that men

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:40.694 align:middle line:84%
and women think,
communicate, process information

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:44.431 align:middle line:84%
and solve problems man and women
can learn to bring out the best

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:50.003 align:middle line:84%
in each other instead of causing
an attack of human/animal.

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:53.139 align:middle line:84%
I'm Alison Armstrong
for Pryor University.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It is
amazing we get along

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:59.913 align:middle line:84%
at all [laughter] based on the
facts of what we just watched.

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.449 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.819 align:middle line:84%
I mean we take this complexity
that we are as females.

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:06.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
we are complex.

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: We are.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:11.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: And we --

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:15.962 align:middle line:84%
how do you relate without
feeling overbearing, dominating,

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:20.066 align:middle line:84%
and feel that the messages
are being heard both ways?

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:21.334 align:middle line:90%
Taking care of both ways.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean how do you take
a complex being and...

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And a [laughter]...

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:29.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: ...and make it
feel like we're not overbearing?

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:33.413 align:middle line:84%
Because it can overbearing
to be so complex.

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Absolutely.

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:39.553 align:middle line:84%
Well I think the opposite of
that that you're referring

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:42.188 align:middle line:84%
to men describe themselves
as simple.

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:45.859 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
I've heard a lot when they find

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:48.261 align:middle line:84%
out I've been studying
them for 20 years...

00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:49.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...or more.

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:50.997 align:middle line:90%
Its 22 years now.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.934 align:middle line:84%
They'll look at me and go,
"Are you slow [laughter]?"

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.302 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers].

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:59.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But men
think for me to be studying them

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.941 align:middle line:90%
for this long I must be slow.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh [laughter].

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Because
they even think they're simple.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.781 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is men are
not actually that simple.

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:09.649 align:middle line:90%
They're very direct.

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:12.252 align:middle line:84%
But what we're discovered
is like you have

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to do nine things right
to successfully ask a man

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.525 align:middle line:90%
for something you need.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.593 align:middle line:84%
Nine things you have
to do right.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: We women do?

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:22.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:25.532 align:middle line:84%
To get what you need from a man
there's nine things you have

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:90%
to do right?

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: What [laughter]?

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.101 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:28.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:29.703 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter]
Okay, we can handle this.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:34.074 align:middle line:90%
But to me that's not simple.

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.141 align:middle line:90%
If you have to do nine things

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.077 align:middle line:84%
to get what you need,
that's not simple.

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:39.579 align:middle line:84%
But to a man they're simple
because they're very direct.

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:42.282 align:middle line:84%
The point that this
video is making --

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:45.986 align:middle line:84%
which I love what they did
at [inaudible] U. Is that men

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:50.323 align:middle line:84%
and women literally
have opposing instincts.

00:14:50.323 --> 00:14:53.593 align:middle line:84%
So this term opposite
sexes, opposite, opposing;

00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:55.795 align:middle line:90%
we have opposing instincts.

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:59.332 align:middle line:84%
So what testosterone does to a
brain, and what estrogen does

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:01.768 align:middle line:90%
to a brain causes opposing.

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:06.806 align:middle line:84%
So for example, testosterone
makes a brain focus

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
which has it commit to a
result and the brain screens

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.113 align:middle line:84%
out everything irrelevant
to the result.

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:13.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Ah.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:14.848 align:middle line:90%
Keeps it focused.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:15.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Screens out everything.

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:17.384 align:middle line:90%
It keeps it focused so that --

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.286 align:middle line:84%
so vision is affected,
hearing is affected.

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:84%
If it's not considered relevant
to the result it's not heard

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.827 align:middle line:84%
and it may be seen like as
something to walk around

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:29.195 align:middle line:90%
but it's not seen as actionable.

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So
you put a box in front

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.867 align:middle line:84%
of the back doors hoping
your husband will pick it

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.168 align:middle line:90%
up and take it out.

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:37.971 align:middle line:84%
No, he just walks around it
because it's not processed

00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.841 align:middle line:84%
in the brain as relevant to what
he's committed to at the time.

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:42.909 align:middle line:90%
The -- right?

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:43.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Absolutely.

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:44.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:45.378 align:middle line:84%
The estrogen soaked brain
on the other hand...

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:46.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:84%
In the estrogen soaked
brain everything is

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.549 align:middle line:90%
relevant [laughter].

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:84%
There's no commitment,
there's just an awareness...

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:54.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Of everything.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...of everything.

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:58.691 align:middle line:84%
Everything's relevant,
everything needs to be done.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.359 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:01.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It needs to be done.

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.429 align:middle line:90%
Which then also conflicts.

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:04.998 align:middle line:84%
Right? So to a woman
everything is worth doing

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.466 align:middle line:84%
because then it's
done [laughter]

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:09.002 align:middle line:90%
and it stops calling out to her.

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But to a man he calculates
what's worth doing.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.475 align:middle line:84%
What would be the benefit
of getting that done?

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
How much energy will
it take to do it?

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: No.

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And if
that equation doesn't work

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:21.848 align:middle line:90%
out right it's not worth doing.

00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:23.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I did
that the other day.

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:25.318 align:middle line:84%
I walked around the house and
I picked up the nail polish,

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.188 align:middle line:84%
then a napkin, then I picked up
a few more things then I went

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:29.889 align:middle line:84%
into the hallway and
distributed the things

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:31.523 align:middle line:84%
in the bedroom they needed
to be distributed in.

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:33.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And I
didn't do the initial thing

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:84%
that I planned on
doing [laughter].

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:35.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:36.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Because I --

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:37.697 align:middle line:84%
like all these other
things were distracting me

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:39.032 align:middle line:84%
until I could go back
to the kitchen going,

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.333 align:middle line:90%
"What was I going to do?"

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: You
were probably going to eat.

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.302 align:middle line:90%
Right [laughter]?

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:44.204 align:middle line:90%
That's a thing we forget to do.

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.573 align:middle line:84%
We're as likely to
clean the refrigerator

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.575 align:middle line:84%
as to take something out of
it and put it in our mouths.

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter] Yes.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
I did that Monday.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.013 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so wait you mentioned nine
things we need to do in order

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.215 align:middle line:90%
to get a man to do something.

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:90%
You have to address...

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:57.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I
can't just leave it there?

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:59.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You cannot
just hang that one out there.

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:01.521 align:middle line:90%
What [laughter]?

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: All right.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.057 align:middle line:84%
Well let me see if
I can do this...

00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Just a few words.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I
just had it [laughter].

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:07.527 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.794 align:middle line:84%
Okay. First you have
to pay attention

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.196 align:middle line:90%
to when you're telling him.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: That what
he's focused on is finding

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.268 align:middle line:90%
out what you need from him.

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:16.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:16.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Not driving.

00:17:16.903 --> 00:17:18.638 align:middle line:90%
Not eating.

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.073 align:middle line:90%
Not getting ready for work.

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:22.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Or bed.

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Not
just getting home from work.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.879 align:middle line:84%
Like all these things; he
can't be doing any of those.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.581 align:middle line:84%
He has to be focused on finding
out what you need and that's

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:30.617 align:middle line:84%
when you have to tell
him what you need.

00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And he has to be focused on
finding out what you need

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:90%
by not thinking he's in trouble.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.691 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
attitude, like I need to talk

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.559 align:middle line:90%
to you about something.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:41.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Now he's focused

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:42.529 align:middle line:90%
on staying out of trouble.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:43.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So can
I ask you a question?

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.431 align:middle line:84%
I need help with
something would work.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:49.736 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the right
time window.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Can I ask
for your help with something?

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:55.742 align:middle line:84%
Yes. That's an excellent
word to use.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.211 align:middle line:90%
Men want to be helpful.

00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask for your
help for something;

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't give him
enough information.

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:04.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And women
specialize in vague [laughter].

00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So, we're like, you know,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.589 align:middle line:84%
trying to get this
long runway [laughter].

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.256 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:12.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
So a typical thing

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.593 align:middle line:84%
that drives men crazy
is a woman says,

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.328 align:middle line:84%
"Can I ask you a
quick question?"

00:18:15.328 --> 00:18:16.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And he's
like focused on something.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:19.098 align:middle line:84%
She's like, "Can I ask
you a quick question?"

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:23.269 align:middle line:84%
And he'll nod his head and
she'll wait for him to look

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.072 align:middle line:84%
at her because as women that's
how we know someone's paying

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:90%
attention; we look.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Or
they're still doing thing

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:29.943 align:middle line:90%
and say, "I'm listening."

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.145 align:middle line:90%
Right? But he's waiting for her

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:35.582 align:middle line:84%
to ask the question before
he shifts his attention.

00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Because he needs to
know what is he going

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.185 align:middle line:90%
to shift his attention to.

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:41.955 align:middle line:90%
He's going to shift his focus.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:45.558 align:middle line:84%
He can't shift his focus
to a potential question.

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:84%
He can only shift his
focus to a real question.

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yes [laughter].

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:52.332 align:middle line:90%
So when you say, "Can I ask...

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:53.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Can I ask...

00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:54.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...your help for something?"

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:55.768 align:middle line:84%
Well of course you can ask
your help for something?

00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:56.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
just did [laughter].

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:57.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yeah, it's like,

00:18:57.704 --> 00:18:58.972 align:middle line:84%
"Can I ask your help
for something?"

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't give him anything
to focus on [laughter].

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.543 align:middle line:84%
Right? If you said,
"I need your help.

00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:07.313 align:middle line:84%
Can I tell you what it is and
find out when you can do it?"

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.816 align:middle line:90%
That is concrete.

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And then he'll --

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.554 align:middle line:84%
then he'll let you know if --
when you can tell him what it is

00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:15.722 align:middle line:84%
and he'll tell you
when he can do it.

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
He'll say, "I can't
hear it right now."

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.525 align:middle line:84%
Or, "When I'm done with
this I'll come find out."

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.995 align:middle line:84%
And then you actually
have to wait

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.297 align:middle line:90%
and tell him when he can hear.

00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:28.768 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you have to do
is describe what it looks like.

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:31.738 align:middle line:90%
Because men and women assume

00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:34.474 align:middle line:84%
that they use language
the same way.

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:39.779 align:middle line:84%
So for a man -- for example if a
man says, "I need your support."

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
To a woman support is either
do something [laughter]

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.219 align:middle line:90%
because there's so much to do.

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:46.919 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:47.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:19:47.954 --> 00:19:50.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Or leave me alone

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:51.691 align:middle line:90%
so I can get it done myself.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.193 align:middle line:84%
Quit standing there
stomping your foot.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:58.231 align:middle line:84%
Or sit on the other side of the
counter and be pleasant company.

00:19:58.231 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:19:58.765 --> 00:19:59.966 align:middle line:90%
Right, okay.

00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:01.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: That
is important to a woman.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Those
are supports, yeah.

00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:03.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Do something.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:05.471 align:middle line:84%
Leave me alone to do something,
or be pleasant company.

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:08.341 align:middle line:84%
So when a man says, you
know, "I need more support."

00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:09.309 align:middle line:84%
We're like what do
you want me to do?

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:10.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:10.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right?

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, yeah.

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:15.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: To a
man support is appreciation.

00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:17.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Ah, thank you.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Thank you.

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:22.522 align:middle line:84%
You know, that really mattered,
that really made a difference,

00:20:22.522 --> 00:20:24.457 align:middle line:90%
this is what it provided for me.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:25.992 align:middle line:90%
You're so great, you're amazing.

00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:27.126 align:middle line:84%
That all makes him
feel supported.

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:84%
Appreciation makes
him feel supported.

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:30.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:31.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And the second form

00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:34.701 align:middle line:84%
of support is get
behind the plan.

00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:37.937 align:middle line:84%
We don't even usually know
there is a plan [laughter].

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It just happens.

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:40.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:41.974 align:middle line:90%
Get behind the plan.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:43.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, okay.

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:46.979 align:middle line:84%
So create a to-do list
or a plan [laughter]?

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.315 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a good look
on your face [laughter].

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:50.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: What
are you talking about?

00:20:50.516 --> 00:20:51.918 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:57.123 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've explained to men the
extent of a gather's planning.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:58.758 align:middle line:90%
You know, how we plan would be,

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.094 align:middle line:84%
are you looking for
anything special?

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.963 align:middle line:84%
What meadow do you
want to go to?

00:21:03.963 --> 00:21:05.865 align:middle line:84%
Right? And which end do
you want to start at?

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:07.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So
the hunter gather...

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:09.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: That's
how a hunter gather plans.

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:11.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Men,
their planning is huge

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:13.706 align:middle line:84%
or the masculine, if a
woman's in the masculine.

00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:17.243 align:middle line:84%
It involves commitment, and
strategy, and resources,

00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:21.447 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses, and
strengths, and then timelines,

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and then collecting your
power and getting underway.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.652 align:middle line:84%
And then if it was really
cool we tell a story

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:27.754 align:middle line:90%
about it afterwards.

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That would
describe a lion hunt

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:29.922 align:middle line:90%
in the caveman days.

00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes, yes.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:32.325 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm, so it's got
a lot behind it.

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:33.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:34.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So it's got
a got a lot behind it.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.862 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if we go out
to the meadow we infuse

00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:37.063 align:middle line:84%
with the berries and
[laughter] we chose what we want

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:84%
and there's no structure
around it.

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:40.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: As long
as the kids are okay.

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:41.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.236 align:middle line:84%
We see all these
possibilities and we keep an eye

00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:45.204 align:middle line:84%
on the kids meanwhile because
that's what our diffuse

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:46.205 align:middle line:90%
awareness does.

00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:48.241 align:middle line:84%
Make sure we're safe,
they're safe,

00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:50.176 align:middle line:84%
sees all the possibilities
at the same time.

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:51.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.981 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Well as wonderful as
these techniques are we need

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.916 align:middle line:84%
to apply them of
course to our sex life

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:58.785 align:middle line:84%
because that gets
very confusing.

00:21:58.785 --> 00:21:59.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Especially,
as you get into decades

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.022 align:middle line:90%
and decades of a relationship.

00:22:03.022 --> 00:22:03.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:04.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:06.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: We're going to
take a look at a video just

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:08.628 align:middle line:84%
to start us off [laughter]
on some of Alison's tips

00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:10.997 align:middle line:90%
around communication about sex.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.098 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:22:12.098 --> 00:22:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Oh, this should be good.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we have
to ask questions?

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
because men and women generally

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:22.742 align:middle line:84%
like everything else we've
talked about before assume

00:22:22.742 --> 00:22:25.144 align:middle line:84%
that sex is the same
for their partner...

00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:26.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right.

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:26.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...as it is for them.

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:27.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And it's a huge mistake.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.784 align:middle line:90%
And the first question that...

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:32.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:33.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...we need to ask.

00:22:33.653 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the first question we need

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.758 align:middle line:84%
to ask is what does
sex provide for you?

00:22:38.758 --> 00:22:39.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:40.359 align:middle line:90%
You mean literally...

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Personally.

00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:42.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I mean literally...

00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:90%
>> ...ask that question.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:44.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...ask your
partner and tell your partner.

00:22:44.664 --> 00:22:45.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: What
-- and be very specific.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.803 align:middle line:84%
Like for example for instance
between in the morning

00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
or at night, or drive
by, or smorgasbord.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:58.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I mean
you have to be really specific.

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:84%
If we kiss a lot then this
is what happens for me.

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:02.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:03.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
This is what it provides.

00:23:03.516 --> 00:23:05.551 align:middle line:90%
If we, you know, dress

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.286 align:middle line:84%
up in monkey suits [laughter]
this is what it provides.

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:09.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Whatever
the different situations

00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:09.889 align:middle line:90%
are [laughter].

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly yeah.

00:23:11.023 --> 00:23:12.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: On
vacation versus at home.

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Children at home,
children out of the house.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Right, always
keep a clean monkey suit just

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:17.396 align:middle line:90%
in case [laughter].

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah that's all -- there's
a lot of questions to ask.

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:21.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: I'm sorry.

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:22.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
there's a lot to tell

00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:26.005 align:middle line:84%
because we assume that
it's the same now.

00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:90%
Like for example....

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:29.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...Spencer
will assume that we'll assume

00:23:29.342 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that sex is the same
for you now as it was

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.378 align:middle line:90%
when you were 18 years old.

00:23:32.378 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: No.

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:33.646 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Absolutely
different.

00:23:35.548 --> 00:23:36.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Not even close.

00:23:36.616 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Yeah,
completely different.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Not
even close [laughter].

00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:39.185 align:middle line:90%
Men get much more emotional.

00:23:39.185 --> 00:23:40.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:40.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Spiritual.

00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:41.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:41.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Connected.

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:45.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: It's deeply
important in a relationship...

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...for
reasons that aren't physical

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.531 align:middle line:84%
and women believe as if it still
is and then they're out of sync.

00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: When I was very,

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.401 align:middle line:84%
very young like you know
late teens early 20's I was

00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.335 align:middle line:90%
in a hurry.

00:23:56.335 --> 00:23:59.038 align:middle line:84%
And [laughter] as
time passed I --

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:02.475 align:middle line:84%
my desires and my needs
changed and I slowed

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:05.278 align:middle line:84%
down which is obviously a
great thing for my wife.

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how she wanted
[laughter] things to transpire.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:10.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right.

00:24:10.483 --> 00:24:11.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you ask her?

00:24:11.184 --> 00:24:13.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yes I did.

00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:14.287 align:middle line:90%
>> [Inaudible] [laughter].

00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:14.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Unlike most men
I've always like to talk

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:16.088 align:middle line:90%
about intimate things.

00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:18.691 align:middle line:84%
>> It's embarrassing or
sometimes awkward for couples

00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:19.458 align:middle line:90%
to talk about because...

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:21.327 align:middle line:90%
>> ...they don't want to feel

00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:22.128 align:middle line:84%
like they're hurting
anybody's feelings

00:24:22.128 --> 00:24:23.329 align:middle line:90%
or that you're accusing them

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:24.864 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
doing something right.

00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:28.868 align:middle line:84%
Or I mean, what's a gentle
way to broach the subject?

00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:30.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:32.538 align:middle line:84%
Well I would recommend
taking the long view.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.074 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a committed
relationship we're going

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:36.509 align:middle line:90%
to be doing this for decades.

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:37.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: A long time.

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:38.678 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [laughter].

00:24:38.678 --> 00:24:39.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness [laughter].

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:42.014 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
information we could exchange

00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:44.383 align:middle line:90%
so we could be better at it.

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:45.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:47.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And I've
learned this the hard way.

00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:51.691 align:middle line:84%
I've been married for 17 years
and most of what I teach now

00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:54.527 align:middle line:84%
that couples should exchange
in terms of information;

00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle line:84%
Greg and I didn't start talking
about until five years ago.

00:24:57.563 --> 00:24:58.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Wow.

00:24:58.064 --> 00:24:58.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:58.831 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Let me
ask you this Alison.

00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:02.902 align:middle line:84%
if you sense that your
partner may be uncomfortable

00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:05.738 align:middle line:84%
with certain points
of conversation...

00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:06.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:07.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: ...is
it okay just to ask

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:08.975 align:middle line:90%
if it's okay to talk about it?

00:25:08.975 --> 00:25:11.377 align:middle line:84%
You say, "Are you comfortable
if I ask you some questions

00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:90%
about our intimate sexual life?"

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You can do that.

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
You could also say, "How would
you best like to do this?"

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right.

00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:19.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: I mean

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning I always called
Greg on the phone [laughter].

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: [Laughter] Yeah.

00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:23.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I
couldn't talk to him in person.

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter] Oh, okay.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.792 align:middle line:84%
I thought you like had
sex over the phone.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:27.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
No, I would call him

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:28.894 align:middle line:84%
on the phone [laughter]
could we talk about sex.

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I
was too embarrassed...

00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:31.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:32.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...to talk in person.

00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. I'm embarrassed
right now.

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:90%
I feel like itchy or something.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.368 align:middle line:90%
I'm awkward.

00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's very understandable.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
A lot of people are.

00:25:38.604 --> 00:25:39.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:40.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. We just
touched on one question

00:25:40.306 --> 00:25:41.407 align:middle line:90%
and there are many more.

00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:42.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Many more.

00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:43.809 align:middle line:84%
>> So more with Alison
Armstrong.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:45.378 align:middle line:84%
We're going to tell you about
this workshop that's free

00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:46.345 align:middle line:84%
that she is holding
tonight [applause].

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:47.913 align:middle line:90%
So stay with us.

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.982 align:middle line:84%
[Music] We're back with
Alison Armstrong creator

00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:53.319 align:middle line:84%
of Celebrating Men, Satisfying
Women [laughter] and we're going

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:56.088 align:middle line:84%
to talk about satisfying
each other.

00:25:56.088 --> 00:25:58.257 align:middle line:90%
We've been talking about sex

00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's seven questions
we should ask ourselves

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.164 align:middle line:84%
and our partner, before we
-- to improve our love life.

00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:06.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Relationship.

00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:06.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Our relationships.

00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So we did one already

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.037 align:middle line:84%
and that was what does
sex provide for you.

00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:13.906 align:middle line:84%
The next question;
your pumpkin hours.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.641 align:middle line:90%
What are you pumpkin hours?

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Your pumpkin hours.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.979 align:middle line:84%
Pumpkin hours -- well this
goes back to Cinderella.

00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:23.949 align:middle line:84%
So pumpkin hours, the time
in which the coach turns

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.319 align:middle line:84%
into a pumpkin and can't
give anybody a ride.

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:27.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Right
[laughter], right.

00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:30.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Write that down for me.

00:26:30.022 --> 00:26:31.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: And...

00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:33.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
there is a time in the day...

00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:35.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:36.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: For women
it will be a clock kind of time.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:37.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:26:37.697 --> 00:26:39.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Often

00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:40.566 align:middle line:84%
for men it's the what are
they focused on kind of time.

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:42.902 align:middle line:84%
But for women usually there's
a time in the day usually

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:46.672 align:middle line:84%
after which a request for
sex will create resentment

00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:48.874 align:middle line:84%
because she's going to
lose much needed sleep.

00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:49.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Or too early in the day

00:26:51.377 --> 00:26:54.714 align:middle line:84%
where she's going to be upset
she's losing much needed sleep.

00:26:54.714 --> 00:26:58.384 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that our
partners don't know what are

00:26:58.384 --> 00:26:59.285 align:middle line:90%
the times.

00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm a yes up until 10:30.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: After
that it's just mean to ask.

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:04.757 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a pumpkin.

00:27:04.757 --> 00:27:05.391 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:06.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:07.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You know, please,

00:27:07.393 --> 00:27:07.827 align:middle line:84%
please because it's
mean after then.

00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:08.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:10.763 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a
really weird dynamic...

00:27:10.763 --> 00:27:11.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Tension and...

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:12.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...and tension...

00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:13.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:13.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: You know,

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.434 align:middle line:84%
most women will keep
multitasking

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:17.103 align:middle line:90%
until they're exhausted.

00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:18.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
so the time they come

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:20.806 align:middle line:84%
to bed they're too
tired for that.

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:21.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Sure.

00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:21.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:22.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:23.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's too late

00:27:23.843 --> 00:27:24.276 align:middle line:84%
and you got to catch
her earlier.

00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:25.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:26.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And if you
tell your partner what are the

00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:27.546 align:middle line:90%
hours or the circumstances.

00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:29.215 align:middle line:84%
If my mother's in
town forget it.

00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:29.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:30.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right, right.

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:31.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: You know?

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:32.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:33.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Whatever
your pumpkin hours are.

00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:34.387 align:middle line:84%
Whenever, you're not
available it's important

00:27:34.387 --> 00:27:34.887 align:middle line:90%
to actually tell them.

00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:36.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:36.222 --> 00:27:36.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Those hours will
differ from woman to woman.

00:27:36.956 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:39.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Absolutely.

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely they will.

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. What about signals?

00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:43.429 align:middle line:90%
What are the signals?

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Oh boy.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.565 align:middle line:84%
Another one I learned
the hard way.

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:50.035 align:middle line:84%
So in -- we have a course
called Celebrating Men and Sex,

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.805 align:middle line:84%
and one of the questions we
always ask our panel of men is;

00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:55.708 align:middle line:84%
do you like for your
woman to initiate?

00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:57.243 align:middle line:90%
And they always say, "Yes."

00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:58.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yes.

00:27:58.611 --> 00:27:59.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And all
the women are shaking their head

00:27:59.378 --> 00:28:00.212 align:middle line:90%
going this can't be true.

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:01.781 align:middle line:90%
I've been turned down so often.

00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:03.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:03.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: How can
you possibly say you want me

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:04.216 align:middle line:90%
to initiate?

00:28:04.216 --> 00:28:05.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:06.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: So we
missed the signal?

00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:07.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
That's what it is.

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: We missed
the signals.

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:08.854 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:09.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: The
way that women initiate...

00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:10.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: [Whistling]
[laughter].

00:28:10.589 --> 00:28:11.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:16.829 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea they were
being invited to something.

00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:18.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
They had no idea.

00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:19.865 align:middle line:84%
So she thought she
was being turned

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:22.535 align:middle line:84%
down when he didn't
know he was invited.

00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:23.169 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh [laughter].

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
the opposite happens too.

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.574 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend; her boyfriend
would kiss her on her neck

00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:32.511 align:middle line:84%
as a signal and she would
giggle and go, "Stop that."

00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:33.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:34.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And then
get in the cab and drive off

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.115 align:middle line:84%
and he would be [laughter]
upset.

00:28:36.115 --> 00:28:38.384 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know he was
saying, "Take me with you".

00:28:38.384 --> 00:28:39.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right.

00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:39.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Invite me home.

00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:40.286 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:40.286 --> 00:28:41.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:42.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right, exactly.

00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:43.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
so it can go both ways

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
also the problem

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.926 align:middle line:84%
of if your partner doesn't know
what your signals are they can

00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:49.228 align:middle line:90%
think everything is a signal.

00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:50.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And so when --

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.997 align:middle line:90%
like if her husband just wants

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:53.465 align:middle line:84%
to snuggle they think
he's asking

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.568 align:middle line:84%
for something she's too tired
to give and she'll freeze up.

00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:57.503 --> 00:28:58.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
then he'll feel rejected...

00:28:58.137 --> 00:28:59.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Yeah.

00:28:59.538 --> 00:29:00.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...when he
really just wanted to hold her.

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:00.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:02.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right, right.

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:03.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So you
have to be very specific.

00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
If I say this or if
I touch you here...

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right.

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...I'm asking.

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Everything
else I'm just being friendly.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:11.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Do [laughter] people do
code words like, you know,

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:12.184 align:middle line:90%
like code words like...

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:14.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Some couples
probably do I bet.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:15.721 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:18.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Code words work.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:18.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Salami [laughter].

00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
As long -- yes.

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:20.493 align:middle line:90%
>> It the first...

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:21.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: Yeah
that might work.

00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:23.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Probably not that word but...

00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:25.598 align:middle line:84%
>> You know or -- you know
there's -- do people do that?

00:29:25.598 --> 00:29:26.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Well I knew a couple.

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.334 align:middle line:84%
I knew a couple who says, "I'd
like to have dinner tonight."

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:30.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh. And that means that.

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:31.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
That means that.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.404 align:middle line:84%
And she knows because
they talked

00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:33.973 align:middle line:90%
about this is his, signal.

00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:34.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:35.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right.

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:35.841 align:middle line:90%
And I want four courses.

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:36.675 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:37.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Spencer: Right [laughter].

00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:39.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:40.012 align:middle line:90%
Exactly and she's...

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:40.779 align:middle line:90%
>> And I don't have time.

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.815 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] I can do two.

00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:43.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I can do two.

00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:44.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Spencer: There
we go [laughter].

00:29:44.917 --> 00:29:45.818 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, see.

00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:47.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:84%
So often if you have a code
about it, it can be playful.

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:52.191 align:middle line:90%
The embarrassment can go down.

00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:53.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But
it's really important

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:55.694 align:middle line:84%
because we miss each
other's signals all the time

00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:59.198 align:middle line:84%
and it starts this
cycle of rejection

00:29:59.198 --> 00:30:04.069 align:middle line:84%
that just kills the connection,
and the closeness, and the love.

00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:06.272 align:middle line:84%
And something -- I
mean you're a newlywed,

00:30:06.272 --> 00:30:07.506 align:middle line:90%
I should tell you this.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:09.141 align:middle line:90%
Something women don't know is

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:11.944 align:middle line:84%
that the more emotionally
invested a man is

00:30:11.944 --> 00:30:15.881 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship the harder
it is for him to initiate

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:18.684 align:middle line:84%
because rejection
is felt so keenly.

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:19.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:20.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
So he's waiting

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:22.855 align:middle line:84%
for this giant signal
for -- on her part.

00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:23.989 align:middle line:90%
I want you.

00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:25.925 align:middle line:84%
Before he even indicates
and interest.

00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's
great because yeah,

00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.899 align:middle line:84%
we have some communication
needs especially if you are

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:37.336 align:middle line:84%
into a marriage for the
long haul of a marriage.

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:40.873 align:middle line:84%
And if you are -- you know sex
is different than to be in --

00:30:40.873 --> 00:30:43.175 align:middle line:84%
when you're teenagers,
when you're 20 something,

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.711 align:middle line:84%
when you're courting
a relationship.

00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:49.581 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're 10, 15,
20 years into a relationship.

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:50.683 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yes, I'm 20 years in.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: 20 years in.

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:56.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So how do
you look at that view

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.957 align:middle line:90%
and even talk about it?

00:30:57.957 --> 00:30:58.891 align:middle line:90%
Because it happens.

00:30:58.891 --> 00:31:00.392 align:middle line:90%
It sneaks up on you.

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.227 align:middle line:90%
15 years sneaks up on you.

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:03.629 align:middle line:90%
10 years sneaks up on you.

00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:06.332 align:middle line:84%
How does -- how do you even
establish the communication

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:10.135 align:middle line:84%
about sex in a long
term marriage?

00:31:10.135 --> 00:31:14.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
like you're intimating,

00:31:14.106 --> 00:31:15.407 align:middle line:90%
presumably the commitment

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
of a marriage is you know
till death do us part.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.877 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Presumably.

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:21.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
presumably there's a commitment

00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:24.383 align:middle line:90%
that now it's just us.

00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:25.784 align:middle line:84%
This is it for the
rest of our lives.

00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:27.886 align:middle line:90%
We're out only partners.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:33.292 align:middle line:84%
And both men and
women need variety.

00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:36.295 align:middle line:84%
They need variety, they need
excitement, they need a sense

00:31:36.295 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:90%
of aliveness, engagement...

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Adventure.

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:40.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...newness, adventure.

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:41.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Like you
said [inaudible]...

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:42.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: The
monkey suits [laughter].

00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:46.839 align:middle line:84%
Right? They -- so
we need to have fun.

00:31:46.839 --> 00:31:50.376 align:middle line:84%
Sex is something that men
think is extraordinarily fun.

00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:51.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:53.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Women can
have fun if they stop worrying

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:55.381 align:middle line:84%
about do I need to
suck in my stomach?

00:31:55.381 --> 00:31:56.048 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] You know?

00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:57.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And so there's --

00:31:58.884 --> 00:32:02.187 align:middle line:90%
I mean you have to understand.

00:32:02.187 --> 00:32:05.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this from someone
who could not talk to my husband

00:32:05.858 --> 00:32:09.628 align:middle line:84%
in person about sex for the
first two years of our marriage.

00:32:09.628 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to call him on the
phone to talk to him.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.197 align:middle line:90%
I was two embarrassed.

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:13.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Call
him on the phone?

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:14.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I had
to call him on the phone

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:14.933 align:middle line:90%
to talk to him about sex.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:15.934 align:middle line:90%
I was too embarrassed.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter]
Where was he?

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:17.336 align:middle line:90%
At work?

00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:18.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yeah [laughter].

00:32:18.003 --> 00:32:19.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Great.

00:32:19.371 --> 00:32:20.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I would
call him on the phone at work.

00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
Yes. That's the best I could do
and it's better than nothing.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:26.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Writing
letters is better than nothing.

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
But if you [laughter] --

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.882 align:middle line:84%
you just have to -- whatever
shyness you have you just have

00:32:29.882 --> 00:32:32.117 align:middle line:84%
to get over it, and know
the only thing that's going

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:35.254 align:middle line:84%
to keep this alive
for half a century is

00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:38.724 align:middle line:84%
if we keep communicating
and as it says in the video,

00:32:38.724 --> 00:32:39.792 align:middle line:90%
one of the first things

00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:42.528 align:middle line:84%
to communicate is
what does sex provide.

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:44.963 align:middle line:84%
Because that's another
way that men

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:48.333 align:middle line:84%
and women do -- it
doesn't connect.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:49.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And women
tend to have been imprinted

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:58.243 align:middle line:84%
by teenage men who were pawing
them, being very demanding,

00:32:58.243 --> 00:32:59.978 align:middle line:84%
manipulative, desperate
[laughter].

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:00.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes, yes.

00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:02.181 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Their levels

00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:03.749 align:middle line:84%
of testosterone make them
very desperate for sex.

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
so we get imprinted by that

00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:10.022 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know how to come
at it from being a partner.

00:33:10.022 --> 00:33:12.458 align:middle line:84%
We're sort of defensive
to begin with.

00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:13.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:14.526 align:middle line:90%
It becomes confusing.

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:17.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
then we don't understand

00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:22.134 align:middle line:84%
that the more emotionally
involved a man is with a woman,

00:33:22.134 --> 00:33:25.537 align:middle line:84%
the more it hurts
him to be rejected.

00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:29.541 align:middle line:84%
So the more a man cares for
a woman the harder it's going

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.177 align:middle line:90%
to be for him to ask for sex.

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: When you
see those differences,

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.514 align:middle line:84%
those innate differences
between what men need

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.049 align:middle line:84%
and what women need
what are they?

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean what are the innate --

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.552 align:middle line:84%
what does a man need
in terms of sex?

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:43.355 align:middle line:84%
What does a woman
need in terms of sex?

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:44.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well...

00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:45.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Traditionally.

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:46.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...that's
a really long conversation.

00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
But I'm going to go

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.794 align:middle line:90%
for the simplest thing.

00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:52.598 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with connection.

00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:54.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: For women?

00:33:54.433 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
it actually has to do

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.668 align:middle line:90%
with connection for men too.

00:33:56.668 --> 00:33:58.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Cool.

00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But the
problem [laughter] is women need

00:34:00.172 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to feel connected in order
to be available for sex.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Men need to have sex...

00:34:07.813 --> 00:34:09.014 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: In order to be...

00:34:09.014 --> 00:34:09.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...in
order to be connected.

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Got it.

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:11.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So
that they're available

00:34:11.984 --> 00:34:14.452 align:middle line:90%
for everything else.

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I can
feel a lot of men

00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:17.523 align:middle line:84%
and women nodding
their heads right now.

00:34:17.523 --> 00:34:18.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:18.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:22.928 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately a woman
not knowing that her need

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:28.200 align:middle line:84%
for connection is
specific to her will expect

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.603 align:middle line:84%
that he already knows he
needs to feel connected.

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:37.676 align:middle line:84%
It's rude of him to just start
pawing at her or just, you know,

00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:39.811 align:middle line:90%
men spring sex on us [laughter].

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:40.946 align:middle line:90%
Just out of nowhere.

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:42.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Because
that's the way it is.

00:34:42.014 --> 00:34:42.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Because they're men.

00:34:42.648 --> 00:34:43.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:44.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Exactly, they're ready.

00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:48.954 align:middle line:84%
Let's go. And they don't
know that we need this sense

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.622 align:middle line:84%
of connection and
then we're available.

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So since we don't know
that they're trying

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.095 align:middle line:90%
to have sex to get connected...

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Like that's
literally how they connect

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:00.732 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:35:00.732 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We think it's their job to get
us connected before we have sex.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.371 align:middle line:90%
We blame them for it.

00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We're mad at them like
they're misbehaving.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They're being rude,
they're being inconsiderate.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, because ever woman
knows we should make sure

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.781 align:middle line:90%
that we're all...

00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:16.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That happens.

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...tuned in and...

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:19.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Touchy
feely [laughter].

00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:20.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:90%
And then we can be intimate.

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:23.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: But
so that happens --

00:35:23.689 --> 00:35:26.458 align:middle line:84%
if that conflict happens
and then a woman says no

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:30.495 align:middle line:84%
or turns her back or rejects
that's got to be the worst.

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:32.764 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Crushing
is the word that they use.

00:35:32.764 --> 00:35:33.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Crushing.

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Crushing.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.236 align:middle line:84%
And it imprints them
for a very long time.

00:35:37.236 --> 00:35:41.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And if it happens
over and over its damaging.

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:43.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Oh worse than damaging.

00:35:43.876 --> 00:35:49.581 align:middle line:90%
[ Pause ]

00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:54.319 align:middle line:84%
If he isn't healed from
that he will never be able

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.855 align:middle line:84%
to participate in that
relationship the way he

00:35:56.855 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:90%
could have.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.426 align:middle line:84%
With his whole open heart and
everything he has to give.

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: How do
you heal from that?

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.431 align:middle line:90%
Conversation?

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:08.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Well it starts with --

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.002 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some women
are doing it now --

00:36:10.002 --> 00:36:14.139 align:middle line:84%
recognizing how vulnerable
our husbands are

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:16.141 align:middle line:90%
when they ask for sex.

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:22.814 align:middle line:84%
And so that no, that knee jerk
no, or don't be ridiculous no,

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:26.285 align:middle line:90%
would be the equivalent of like

00:36:26.285 --> 00:36:30.522 align:middle line:84%
if you were sharing this
deep feeling that you had

00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:33.558 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "Why are
you talking about that?"

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Or, "That's stupid."

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Or,

00:36:36.495 --> 00:36:37.963 align:middle line:84%
"Why would I want
to know about that?"

00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:40.432 align:middle line:90%
Right? You would be devastated.

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:41.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And what heals is

00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:47.472 align:middle line:90%
when the other person realizes

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:51.143 align:middle line:84%
that what they did was
devastating and apologizes.

00:36:51.143 --> 00:36:53.412 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good start.

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:54.813 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good start.

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:58.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And on top of that
you have great, great techniques

00:36:58.684 --> 00:37:03.188 align:middle line:84%
on how to mend that divide
[laughter] between how men

00:37:03.188 --> 00:37:07.025 align:middle line:84%
and women need sex
in a different way.

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So first we have to
talk about focus.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:11.196 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Focus
is huge [laughter].

00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:11.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:13.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: For women.

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.567 align:middle line:84%
Because we will do everything
including clean the house

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.403 align:middle line:84%
and pick up all the things
that are screaming at us...

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:19.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:37:19.538 --> 00:37:20.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: ...like I
did with the nail polish

00:37:20.372 --> 00:37:22.107 align:middle line:90%
and the napkin and the socks.

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:24.476 align:middle line:84%
They create -- they
have voices right.

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:25.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: They do.

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter].

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:27.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: They --
the voices are not in our head.

00:37:27.646 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:90%
The pillow has a voice.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
The pillow's saying,
"I'm crooked."

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:32.918 align:middle line:84%
The nail polish is saying,
"Why'd you leave me here?"

00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:34.386 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] I don't belong here.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:35.454 align:middle line:90%
I don't belong here.

00:37:35.454 --> 00:37:37.055 align:middle line:90%
I don't belong here [laughter].

00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:37.856 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:39.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It's so true.

00:37:39.024 --> 00:37:40.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Everything dirty is like,

00:37:40.359 --> 00:37:41.493 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, I'm so gross.

00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:44.162 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe that you
left me here so gross.

00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:45.664 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you take care of me."

00:37:45.664 --> 00:37:49.568 align:middle line:84%
Or to me I have screaming
crumbs at my house.

00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:50.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:37:50.402 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: [Laughter].

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I have
screaming shoes.

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:53.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Screaming shoes.

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:54.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Hmm-mm.

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: You
have screaming shoes,

00:37:56.975 --> 00:37:57.642 align:middle line:90%
I have screaming crumbs.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers].

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: They
actually do [laughter].

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.445 align:middle line:90%
They say things.

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:05.317 align:middle line:84%
But it is very challenging
for a woman to focus

00:38:05.317 --> 00:38:09.421 align:middle line:84%
when those things are around the
house or the kitchen at night.

00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.288 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.123 align:middle line:90%
Is it just me?

00:38:11.123 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Is...

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:12.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's anytime.

00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:13.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Anytime.

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.493 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:15.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Women
-- okay, not just women.

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:18.063 align:middle line:90%
I -- it's related to estrogen.

00:38:18.063 --> 00:38:18.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:38:18.497 --> 00:38:19.598 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:38:19.598 --> 00:38:20.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
So I'm post-menopausal

00:38:20.832 --> 00:38:24.236 align:middle line:84%
so I have less estrogen
so I'm getting focused.

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:25.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:38:25.604 --> 00:38:27.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And it's
a whole new set of problems

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:30.709 align:middle line:84%
and I have a whole new
kind of compassion for men.

00:38:30.709 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But for most women, for most
of our lives, that awareness

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.616 align:middle line:90%
that the estrogen creates;

00:38:37.616 --> 00:38:40.052 align:middle line:84%
it has that stuff talk
to us all the time.

00:38:40.052 --> 00:38:41.386 align:middle line:90%
So now this is talking to me.

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:42.087 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:42.087 --> 00:38:43.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: It has
it talk to us all the time

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:49.227 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately since we don't
know that when we need to focus,

00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:51.196 align:middle line:84%
like when we need to
work on something.

00:38:51.196 --> 00:38:52.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:38:52.464 --> 00:38:56.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Our
impulse is to clean the area.

00:38:56.802 --> 00:39:00.539 align:middle line:84%
Put everything away, take
all the distractions away.

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:02.674 align:middle line:84%
And since we don't know
that that's in order

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:05.911 align:middle line:84%
to allow our brain to focus we
think we're procrastinating.

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:09.614 align:middle line:84%
So the whole time we're
cleaning so we can focus,

00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:12.918 align:middle line:84%
we're mad at ourselves for
not just getting to work.

00:39:12.918 --> 00:39:13.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:39:13.452 --> 00:39:14.519 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:15.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
So we beat ourselves

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:18.757 align:middle line:84%
up while we're doing what we
need to do to allow our brain

00:39:18.757 --> 00:39:20.092 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention to something.

00:39:20.092 --> 00:39:21.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You have
a really great piece

00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:90%
about this [laughter].

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.662 align:middle line:90%
I want you to just take a look.

00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Alison's really a stand-up
comic in my opinion [laughter].

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.765 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
this video [laughter].

00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:30.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
All right guys.

00:39:30.669 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
a stretch for you

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.706 align:middle line:84%
because the easiest
thing to do will be

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:40.378 align:middle line:84%
to think this is a version
of how you think [laughter].

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not [laughter].

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:49.488 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Diffuse means to
pour in every direction.

00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:57.829 align:middle line:84%
As a man you are what
we call single focused.

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:01.666 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You're single
focused [laughter].

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:04.402 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention to
one result at a time.

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:08.073 align:middle line:90%
Single focus.

00:40:08.073 --> 00:40:11.543 align:middle line:90%
We have diffuse awareness.

00:40:11.543 --> 00:40:14.479 align:middle line:84%
Most men will interpret that,
"Oh, so you pay attention

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to three or four
things at a time?"

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.484 align:middle line:90%
No [laughter]!

00:40:19.484 --> 00:40:24.189 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, you focus on two or
three things at a time."

00:40:24.189 --> 00:40:24.890 align:middle line:90%
No [laughter]!

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:29.161 align:middle line:90%
It means we don't focus.

00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:38.236 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.107 align:middle line:90%
We don't focus.

00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean we
can't focus because we can.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.646 align:middle line:84%
For short period of
time and it's like --

00:40:47.646 --> 00:40:51.449 align:middle line:84%
you know how much energy it
takes to get the shuttle free

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.186 align:middle line:84%
from the force of
gravity [laughter]?

00:40:54.186 --> 00:40:57.122 align:middle line:84%
Right? You know, all the fuels
burned up getting it free

00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:58.623 align:middle line:90%
from the force of gravity?

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.225 align:middle line:84%
That's what it takes for
us to focus [laughter].

00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:04.796 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll sit down to write
something which requires focus.

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:08.266 align:middle line:84%
Right? And I'll -- oh but
look at this -- focus.

00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:10.101 align:middle line:84%
Oh but this is --
focus [laughter].

00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Focus Alison, focus!

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.572 align:middle line:90%
Focus [laughter], focus!

00:41:13.572 --> 00:41:14.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter].

00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.309 align:middle line:84%
How do you -- I mean do
you get yourself to focus

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:19.978 align:middle line:90%
by telling yourself focus?

00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:22.347 align:middle line:90%
You're conscious of it?

00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:23.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I'll do that

00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:26.184 align:middle line:90%
or I've gotten even smarter.

00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:28.753 align:middle line:84%
Which this -- the next
clip I know you're going

00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:29.955 align:middle line:90%
to show will talk about.

00:41:29.955 --> 00:41:30.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh yeah.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But I
actually make appointments

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:38.296 align:middle line:90%
with other people to focus.

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:39.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: What do you mean?

00:41:39.631 --> 00:41:40.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: [Laughter]

00:41:40.732 --> 00:41:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the feminine
-- right, connection.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.168 align:middle line:90%
Connection.

00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:44.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:44.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Will have us focus.

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:45.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Being connected.

00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:50.709 align:middle line:84%
So I'll make an appointment
and one of my coworkers will be

00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:52.077 align:middle line:90%
on the other end of the phone.

00:41:52.077 --> 00:41:55.981 align:middle line:84%
They mute their side, they
work on whatever they work on.

00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:58.817 align:middle line:84%
I've got my headset
on so I am tethered.

00:41:58.817 --> 00:41:59.517 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:00.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes, yes.

00:42:00.652 --> 00:42:01.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
I'll write an article.

00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:02.053 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:02.053 --> 00:42:03.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Brilliant.

00:42:03.154 --> 00:42:03.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I'll write an article.

00:42:03.822 --> 00:42:04.956 align:middle line:90%
I'll edit something.

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:07.459 align:middle line:84%
I'll focus because
they're holding me there.

00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps me
from wandering off...

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: To
check the email,

00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:12.063 align:middle line:90%
whatever else would come up.

00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:12.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:13.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Absolutely.

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:90%
Wow. All right [laughter].

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:17.936 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to -- this is
going to be such a key piece

00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
for you men right now -- when
it comes to getting a woman

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.677 align:middle line:84%
to focus on your needs before
bed take a look at this video.

00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:27.545 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: [Laughter]
As a woman doing eight

00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:33.718 align:middle line:84%
to 10 things at the
same time is easy.

00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:38.356 align:middle line:84%
It's doing one thing
that's almost impossible.

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:40.425 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really, really,

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:43.395 align:middle line:84%
really hard for us
to just do one thing.

00:42:43.395 --> 00:42:52.203 align:middle line:84%
And a very common place for
this to hurt other people,

00:42:52.203 --> 00:42:57.942 align:middle line:84%
especially to hurt men
is when you're talking.

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:01.946 align:middle line:84%
And because you're single
focused it's natural

00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:10.355 align:middle line:84%
to assume I'm talking,
therefore [laughter] you listen.

00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:12.957 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't work that way.

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:17.062 align:middle line:84%
For one reason because as
men you have a particular

00:43:17.062 --> 00:43:21.099 align:middle line:84%
relationship to your needs that
we call critical and urgent.

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:24.936 align:middle line:84%
So when you need to talk
you just start talking.

00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:26.404 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what we're doing.

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:28.106 align:middle line:90%
You just start talking.

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.474 align:middle line:90%
And you expect us to listen.

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:84%
And we've got this environment
screaming for our attention

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:38.016 align:middle line:90%
and you expect us to listen.

00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:41.453 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll try
to listen [laughter]

00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:44.689 align:middle line:90%
but then something will happen.

00:43:44.689 --> 00:43:47.325 align:middle line:84%
And like a child will come
up and ask for something

00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:49.594 align:middle line:84%
or they water's boiling
over on the stove,

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:52.497 align:middle line:84%
or we suddenly remember, "Oh
shoot I didn't get out the blank

00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:53.965 align:middle line:90%
from the refrigerator."

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:57.669 align:middle line:84%
You know, something in
our awareness will come up

00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:03.641 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to men that a woman
is choosing to do that thing,

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.444 align:middle line:90%
instead of listening to him.

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:07.746 align:middle line:90%
Like she choose it.

00:44:07.746 --> 00:44:10.081 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, the water boiling
over is way more important

00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:11.483 align:middle line:84%
than what Eli's got
to say [laughter].

00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:16.621 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that way and
then your feelings get hurt

00:44:16.621 --> 00:44:18.456 align:middle line:84%
and you get upset
and you shut down.

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:20.792 align:middle line:84%
And then we don't know
why you're shut down.

00:44:20.792 --> 00:44:24.095 align:middle line:84%
But we can tell you're
shut down and we get tense.

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:26.498 align:middle line:84%
And then the tension has us
start doing all these behaviors

00:44:26.498 --> 00:44:32.704 align:middle line:84%
to try to please you, which
I'll explain in a little while.

00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:34.139 align:middle line:90%
And it just evolves from there.

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:36.875 align:middle line:84%
It gets worse, and worse,
and worse, and worse.

00:44:36.875 --> 00:44:38.109 align:middle line:90%
What would really help --

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:39.844 align:middle line:84%
there's two things
that would really help.

00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:43.081 align:middle line:84%
One is recognizing
that we didn't choose

00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.517 align:middle line:90%
to not listen to you.

00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:46.851 align:middle line:90%
We really didn't.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.754 align:middle line:84%
We didn't decide that
something was more important

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:51.723 align:middle line:90%
than listening to you.

00:44:51.723 --> 00:44:53.625 align:middle line:84%
So it really -- it's
not personal [laughter].

00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:54.826 align:middle line:90%
We just got pulled.

00:44:54.826 --> 00:44:57.796 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that can
really help is set us up.

00:44:57.796 --> 00:45:03.568 align:middle line:84%
The way that it works for Greg
and I it's like a code word.

00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:06.838 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Can I tell
you something?"

00:45:06.838 --> 00:45:09.674 align:middle line:84%
Now I know when he says,
"Can I tell you something?"

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:11.442 align:middle line:90%
This is important to him.

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:15.079 align:middle line:84%
It's his way of asking for
my undivided attention.

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.548 align:middle line:90%
Or the closest thing

00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:20.151 align:middle line:84%
to my undivided attention
[laughter] that I can give him.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:24.255 align:middle line:84%
Which the way that it works is
listening, listening, listening,

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.924 align:middle line:84%
oh listen [noises]
listen, listen.

00:45:25.924 --> 00:45:27.091 align:middle line:90%
Listen he's talking.

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.993 align:middle line:90%
Listen [laughter].

00:45:28.993 --> 00:45:36.034 align:middle line:84%
And often what I'll do is
I'll take him to the quietest;

00:45:36.034 --> 00:45:39.737 align:middle line:84%
translation, cleanest, neatest,
part of my house [laughter].

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.472 align:middle line:84%
I'll take him there
to listen to him

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.575 align:middle line:84%
because there's the fewest
things talking to me.

00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:47.345 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's on the phone I'll go
to the quietest part of my house

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:49.013 align:middle line:90%
and I'll often close my eyes.

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.082 align:middle line:90%
Just so -- like, "Okay honey.

00:45:51.082 --> 00:45:57.889 align:middle line:84%
What did you want to
tell me [laughter]?"

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:00.058 align:middle line:90%
A couple days after this course

00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:02.193 align:middle line:84%
when Greg did it
the first time he --

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:06.731 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
diffuse awareness and he said,

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:11.603 align:middle line:90%
"It's different during sex.

00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:17.075 align:middle line:90%
Right [laughter]?"

00:46:17.075 --> 00:46:22.413 align:middle line:84%
And the look on his face
was so hopeful [laughter]

00:46:26.351 --> 00:46:29.654 align:middle line:84%
that it was -- it was
one of those moments

00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:32.023 align:middle line:84%
in our relationship when
I was really tempted

00:46:32.023 --> 00:46:33.424 align:middle line:90%
to lie [laughter].

00:46:34.592 --> 00:46:37.395 align:middle line:90%
Just to make him feel better.

00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:41.599 align:middle line:84%
You know? But we don't do
that in our relationship

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:50.675 align:middle line:90%
and so I [laughter], "No honey.

00:46:51.743 --> 00:46:54.379 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry [laughter]
it's not different."

00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:58.383 align:middle line:84%
"The voices don't
go away [laughter]?"

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.686 align:middle line:90%
"No they don't [laughter]."

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:06.658 align:middle line:84%
But it helped me
to see something

00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:09.060 align:middle line:84%
about women that's
really important

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.897 align:middle line:84%
and that is while
the other voices,

00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:16.901 align:middle line:84%
while the other things don't
go away there is something

00:47:16.901 --> 00:47:24.275 align:middle line:84%
that you can do with a
woman that has you be by far

00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:30.281 align:middle line:84%
and away the loudest thing
happening in the environment.

00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:34.385 align:middle line:90%
The loudest.

00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Like whoa [laughter].

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.355 align:middle line:90%
You know like [laughter].

00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:38.423 align:middle line:84%
Leslie can you come up
for a second [laughter]?

00:47:38.423 --> 00:47:46.531 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to demonstrate
what you can do.

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:47.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Oh.

00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:47.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Hi.

00:47:47.899 --> 00:47:48.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Hi.

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:57.675 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:47:58.776 --> 00:47:59.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Touch her [laughter].

00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:00.511 align:middle line:90%
Just touch her.

00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.748 align:middle line:84%
Touch is the loudest
thing in our environment.

00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:04.716 align:middle line:90%
It grounds us.

00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:08.786 align:middle line:84%
It kind of like has
us come here.

00:48:08.786 --> 00:48:14.425 align:middle line:84%
So if you've ever been to
a really great masseuse

00:48:14.425 --> 00:48:18.162 align:middle line:84%
who once they put their hands
on you they never let go,

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:20.231 align:middle line:84%
they never -- like if they're
getting lotion they have one

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:22.066 align:middle line:84%
hand on your back and
they're getting it with --

00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:23.768 align:middle line:90%
they never ever let go.

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:24.936 align:middle line:84%
That's how you want
to be with a woman.

00:48:24.936 --> 00:48:27.839 align:middle line:84%
Once you get ahold
of her don't let go.

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:31.609 align:middle line:84%
If you're making love to her,
never not be touching her.

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:33.911 align:middle line:84%
That's how you keep
her focused there.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.813 align:middle line:84%
Or the closest thing she
has to it [laughter].

00:48:35.813 --> 00:48:37.248 align:middle line:84%
That's how you keep
her attention.

00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:39.984 align:middle line:90%
Never not be touching her.

00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:42.754 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to -- see one
of the things that happens

00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:45.656 align:middle line:84%
to a woman is we're
-- we get tired.

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:48.226 align:middle line:90%
Right? But we're not like a man.

00:48:48.226 --> 00:48:51.763 align:middle line:84%
When you're tired you
fall asleep [laughter].

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:90%
Wherever you are [laughter].

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:03.508 align:middle line:84%
As a woman we're tired but our
environment is still talking

00:49:03.508 --> 00:49:05.743 align:middle line:84%
and saying how we -- this needs
to be and this needs to be done,

00:49:05.743 --> 00:49:07.045 align:middle line:84%
this needs to be done,
and this needs to be done.

00:49:07.045 --> 00:49:10.481 align:middle line:84%
And this needs to be done,
and this needs to be done.

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:13.684 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest complaints
in couples is you'll want

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to make love and she
never comes to bed.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.322 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
she does come

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.825 align:middle line:84%
to bed she's exhausted
[laughter].

00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:23.728 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the
most nightmares

00:49:23.728 --> 00:49:27.565 align:middle line:84%
in a woman's life
is crawling into bed

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:29.967 align:middle line:90%
and you're awake [laughter].

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:36.774 align:middle line:84%
Because there's only one reason
you're still awake [laughter].

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:45.283 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that we don't
want to make love with you.

00:49:45.283 --> 00:49:49.087 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we wouldn't have
loved to make love with you.

00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:53.391 align:middle line:84%
You just should've invited me a
couple of hours ago [laughter].

00:49:53.391 --> 00:49:56.661 align:middle line:90%
When I still had something left.

00:49:56.661 --> 00:50:01.332 align:middle line:84%
Because all the multi-tasking
took it out of me.

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:05.002 align:middle line:84%
So I mean one of the biggest
things that could happen

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:10.141 align:middle line:84%
for couples love lives is
you got to invite her to bed.

00:50:10.141 --> 00:50:14.412 align:middle line:84%
You got to become the loudest
thing in the environment.

00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:19.217 align:middle line:84%
And you'll think oh she's too
busy, she's not interested.

00:50:19.217 --> 00:50:21.586 align:middle line:84%
You're always a better
offer [laughter].

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.288 align:middle line:90%
Always, always a better offer.

00:50:24.288 --> 00:50:26.524 align:middle line:84%
So you got to go
[inaudible], Honey.

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:27.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Hmm-mm.

00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:29.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I'd really
like to make love to you now.

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:30.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Oh [laughter].

00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:31.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Come with me [laughter].

00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:32.663 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
brush your teeth?

00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:33.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Yes [laughter].

00:50:33.631 --> 00:50:34.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Okay [laughter].

00:50:34.332 --> 00:50:40.905 align:middle line:90%
Don't let go [laughter].

00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:49.981 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you'd
like to do first?

00:50:53.484 --> 00:50:54.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: No.

00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:56.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Can I run
a shower for you or anything?

00:50:56.521 --> 00:50:59.891 align:middle line:84%
Will help you feel
fresh and lovely?

00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:00.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: No [laughter].

00:51:00.925 --> 00:51:01.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You're ready now?

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie: Yes.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.661 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:51:03.661 --> 00:51:06.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay so now
we've both learned a little bit

00:51:06.097 --> 00:51:09.867 align:middle line:84%
about how to gently ease into
that place where no happens

00:51:09.867 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and where everybody's
needs get met.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.372 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, for the interim.

00:51:14.372 --> 00:51:19.544 align:middle line:84%
Now what about -- gosh, so many
questions for you [laughter].

00:51:19.544 --> 00:51:22.880 align:middle line:84%
When my husband's talking to
me and he's telling me a story

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.382 align:middle line:90%
about something that happened.

00:51:24.382 --> 00:51:25.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:27.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I constantly am
either interrupting him during

00:51:27.952 --> 00:51:33.057 align:middle line:84%
the story or I do the dishes,
or I'll finish his sentence

00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:35.793 align:middle line:90%
or the story for him, or I'll...

00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:37.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Why -- do other
women -- is this common?

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's very common.

00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:41.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It drives men crazy.

00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:42.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It does?

00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:44.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It
drives them nuts?

00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:45.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So what is that?

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.406 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just not sit
and listen to the story?

00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:51.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well,
there's several things going on.

00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay?

00:51:53.578 --> 00:51:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And listening to a story is
different than waiting for them

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
to answer a question,
which is a different kind

00:51:58.015 --> 00:51:59.283 align:middle line:90%
of excruciating [laughter].

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.352 align:middle line:84%
Okay? You want me
to talk about both?

00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: God,
yeah [laughter].

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:52:03.588 --> 00:52:04.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:52:04.689 --> 00:52:07.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
So first of all it's --

00:52:07.525 --> 00:52:11.295 align:middle line:84%
with this diffuse
awareness pulling us

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.464 align:middle line:90%
to do all these things.

00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:14.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
There's no sense of priority.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.402 align:middle line:84%
There's no level
of importance's.

00:52:18.402 --> 00:52:19.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:52:19.604 --> 00:52:21.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
this is very hard for men

00:52:21.172 --> 00:52:24.041 align:middle line:84%
because they're constantly
prioritizing.

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:27.511 align:middle line:84%
Not only is that worth
doing or not worth doing,

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:30.948 align:middle line:84%
but if it is worth doing is
this the right time to do it?

00:52:30.948 --> 00:52:32.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: They're
asking that of us

00:52:32.016 --> 00:52:33.050 align:middle line:90%
as we're doing all these things?

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:33.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
They do it all...

00:52:33.718 --> 00:52:35.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well they
ask it of themselves constantly.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, okay.

00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:37.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And
they'll try to ask it of us

00:52:37.855 --> 00:52:39.090 align:middle line:90%
when we're overwhelmed.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:84%
They'll be like, "Honey just
do one thing at a time."

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:41.993 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:41.993 --> 00:52:43.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:44.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And we'll be like,

00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:44.862 align:middle line:84%
then do you know how
far behind I'll be

00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:45.730 align:middle line:90%
if I do one thing at a time?

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:46.397 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:47.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So
men are always weighing;

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.704 align:middle line:84%
they're weighing the energy
expenditure against the benefit

00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and is this the right
time given everything else

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.174 align:middle line:90%
that is happening.

00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:58.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

00:52:58.209 --> 00:52:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And since they do

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that they think we're
doing that.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.416 align:middle line:84%
And this has horrible
consequences

00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:09.387 align:middle line:84%
because they'll be
telling us something

00:53:09.387 --> 00:53:12.823 align:middle line:90%
and we'll, you know, wander off.

00:53:12.823 --> 00:53:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll -- something will catch
our eye that's out of place.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:18.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And we'll
go pick it up and put it away,

00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.464 align:middle line:84%
or a child will come in
and ask us for something

00:53:20.464 --> 00:53:22.466 align:middle line:84%
and we'll respond
to that request.

00:53:22.466 --> 00:53:24.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes and he
said, "I was talking to you."

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:25.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:28.005 align:middle line:90%
And he thinks that in

00:53:28.005 --> 00:53:32.443 align:middle line:84%
that moment we consciously made
the decision putting this away

00:53:32.443 --> 00:53:34.445 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
to listening to him.

00:53:34.445 --> 00:53:36.213 align:middle line:84%
Taking care of this
child is more important

00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:36.947 align:middle line:90%
than listening to him.

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:37.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:53:37.882 --> 00:53:38.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Getting this

00:53:38.883 --> 00:53:39.650 align:middle line:84%
out of the refrigerator
[laughter]...

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Your friend.

00:53:41.052 --> 00:53:42.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: My friend
[laughter], there's my friend --

00:53:42.687 --> 00:53:44.689 align:middle line:84%
is more important
than listening to him.

00:53:44.689 --> 00:53:46.557 align:middle line:90%
They think we chose that

00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:51.329 align:middle line:84%
and that's what has him feel
disrespected, dishonored.

00:53:51.329 --> 00:53:52.797 align:middle line:90%
You don't care about me.

00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:54.398 align:middle line:90%
That -- it can be crushing.

00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:55.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:56.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Anywhere

00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.601 align:middle line:84%
from irritating to
crushing to men.

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Because
they think we consciously chose

00:54:00.638 --> 00:54:02.873 align:middle line:84%
the way they would
have consciously chose.

00:54:02.873 --> 00:54:04.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Something
else instead of them.

00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:05.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:10.047 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we encourage to
hold a woman's hold attention,

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:12.350 align:middle line:90%
literally hold her hand.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.985 align:middle line:84%
Because that touch will
make you the loudest thing

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:16.087 align:middle line:90%
in her environment.

00:54:16.087 --> 00:54:17.988 align:middle line:84%
So that's a place
that you start.

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, "Honey can
I tell you something.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.258 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you something.

00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:24.695 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you need
to put away so you can listen

00:54:24.695 --> 00:54:25.763 align:middle line:90%
to what I have to tell you?"

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:26.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh,
you're kidding me right?

00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:27.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I'm not kidding.

00:54:27.798 --> 00:54:28.899 align:middle line:84%
He should definitely
do this [laughter].

00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:30.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well what
if I'm making dinner

00:54:30.401 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:84%
and he just wants
to tell me a story.

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:33.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Then you should say,

00:54:33.671 --> 00:54:35.973 align:middle line:84%
"Honey if you really
want me to...

00:54:35.973 --> 00:54:37.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:40.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...this is not a good time."

00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:41.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:41.912 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh [laughter].

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:42.813 align:middle line:90%
You can say that.

00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:43.581 align:middle line:90%
I can huh?

00:54:43.581 --> 00:54:44.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:47.151 align:middle line:84%
"If you really want me to
listen this is not a good time."

00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:47.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:49.019 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers].

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:49.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Or do
you just want me to kind

00:54:49.987 --> 00:54:51.489 align:middle line:84%
of listen while I'm
cooking dinner?

00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:52.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Right or
else dinner will burn.

00:54:52.857 --> 00:54:54.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:54:54.258 --> 00:54:55.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And if you're okay
with burnt dinner then I'll sit.

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:54:56.427 --> 00:54:57.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: If not then I'll
finish dinner and then we'll sit

00:54:57.495 --> 00:54:59.163 align:middle line:90%
and talk about it during dinner.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:00.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:02.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Or after dinner.

00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:04.135 align:middle line:84%
But can you see how that
would be a partnership?

00:55:04.135 --> 00:55:05.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:07.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: He
gets to choose, do you know,

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:08.639 align:middle line:90%
how important is this.

00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:09.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:55:09.974 --> 00:55:10.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Is it
more important to say it now?

00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:12.176 align:middle line:84%
Is it more important
than dinner?

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:14.111 align:middle line:84%
Because he is naturally
going to prioritize.

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:15.513 align:middle line:90%
Right [laughter]?

00:55:15.513 --> 00:55:18.649 align:middle line:84%
But I asked one -- I asked one
to Greg, [laughter] I was like,

00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:22.319 align:middle line:84%
"Okay, so when you start
talking you expect me

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.521 align:middle line:90%
to start listening."

00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Just to
stop everything I'm doing.

00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:25.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yeah.

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.457 align:middle line:90%
And he was so funny.

00:55:26.457 --> 00:55:27.491 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Yeah.

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:28.559 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking [laughter]."

00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: But
how is that possible?

00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:31.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
[Laughter] It's not possible.

00:55:31.362 --> 00:55:32.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It's not.

00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:33.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: But
from his point of view...

00:55:33.898 --> 00:55:34.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It is.

00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...it's time to talk.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.036 align:middle line:84%
Right? So he has to learn
partnership, as well.

00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:40.871 align:middle line:84%
Men have to learn how
to partner with us

00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:42.773 align:middle line:84%
in when would be a good
time to talk to you

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:44.108 align:middle line:90%
about something important.

00:55:44.108 --> 00:55:45.109 align:middle line:90%
When can I have your attention?

00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:46.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:55:46.477 --> 00:55:47.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Is there
anything in the environment

00:55:47.878 --> 00:55:49.847 align:middle line:84%
that you need to take care of
so I can have your attention?

00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:52.316 align:middle line:84%
Right? So that would
be the first step.

00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:53.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:55.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Then the
second thing that you have

00:55:55.152 --> 00:56:02.827 align:middle line:84%
to know is if he's telling you a
story there's a very good chance

00:56:02.827 --> 00:56:05.329 align:middle line:90%
he's told you this story before.

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:08.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Why is that?

00:56:08.933 --> 00:56:09.967 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:11.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
[Laughter] I know.

00:56:11.168 --> 00:56:13.070 align:middle line:84%
This offends every female
sensibility [laughter].

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.072 align:middle line:90%
And we need the men to know why.

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:15.739 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:16.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay?

00:56:16.507 --> 00:56:17.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:23.013 align:middle line:84%
Because when a woman conveys
information she does that only

00:56:23.013 --> 00:56:25.316 align:middle line:84%
with her tribe, with
her team members.

00:56:25.316 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Right? Because otherwise
she's not going

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.419 align:middle line:84%
to tell people where
he berries are.

00:56:28.419 --> 00:56:29.086 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:29.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:56:29.787 --> 00:56:30.254 align:middle line:90%
She's got to trust it.

00:56:30.254 --> 00:56:31.388 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:32.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: She
conveys the information

00:56:32.156 --> 00:56:33.424 align:middle line:90%
to the person she trusts.

00:56:33.424 --> 00:56:35.960 align:middle line:84%
She expects that they have
the same kind of database

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.263 align:middle line:84%
that she does and that they're
storing that information

00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:40.764 align:middle line:90%
and they'll remember it.

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:84%
That they've got the kind
of memory that she does.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:47.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:56:47.505 --> 00:56:48.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And they're going

00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:51.876 align:middle line:84%
to be meticulously accurate
because that's how you get back

00:56:51.876 --> 00:56:53.777 align:middle line:84%
to the berries at
the right time.

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The right time.

00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Maybe
another time we'll get to talk

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.981 align:middle line:90%
about that in even more detail.

00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:56:58.249 --> 00:57:00.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So
there's a commitment to accuracy

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:03.687 align:middle line:84%
and there's a commitment
to remembering who we told.

00:57:03.687 --> 00:57:08.025 align:middle line:84%
And an assumption that
they'll remember it.

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:11.829 align:middle line:84%
So much so that a
woman will apologize

00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:13.964 align:middle line:84%
if she can't remember
if she told someone.

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:17.334 align:middle line:84%
She'll say, "Forgive me if
I've told you this already.

00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:18.302 align:middle line:84%
Did I already tell
you about that?"

00:57:18.302 --> 00:57:18.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:19.937 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:21.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
She'll check and see

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:22.139 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't want
to insult the other person.

00:57:22.139 --> 00:57:23.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:57:23.207 --> 00:57:24.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Insult their memory.

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Or they'll say,

00:57:25.476 --> 00:57:26.911 align:middle line:84%
"I know I already told you
this before but I just want

00:57:26.911 --> 00:57:28.913 align:middle line:84%
to tell you this is the
right time [laughter]."

00:57:28.913 --> 00:57:30.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:57:30.047 --> 00:57:31.715 align:middle line:84%
We'll acknowledge that
we've told them before.

00:57:31.715 --> 00:57:32.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:33.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right?

00:57:33.918 --> 00:57:38.455 align:middle line:84%
So when a man is telling us a
story we think that the purpose

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.791 align:middle line:84%
of telling us that
story is to convey

00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:43.294 align:middle line:84%
to us the facts within
the story.

00:57:43.294 --> 00:57:44.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: That's
what we think he's doing

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:50.367 align:middle line:84%
because that's -- would have
been the purpose of our story.

00:57:50.367 --> 00:57:55.573 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that him telling
a story again and again,

00:57:55.573 --> 00:58:00.377 align:middle line:84%
is what a man does
to refuel himself.

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:01.412 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, look on your face.

00:58:01.412 --> 00:58:03.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I am
so confused by that.

00:58:03.047 --> 00:58:03.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's perfect.

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:07.017 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Men empower themselves.

00:58:07.017 --> 00:58:11.522 align:middle line:84%
They give themselves juice
by telling the stories

00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:13.057 align:middle line:90%
of the best adventures,

00:58:13.057 --> 00:58:15.693 align:middle line:84%
of the most challenging
problems they've solved.

00:58:15.693 --> 00:58:17.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

00:58:17.061 --> 00:58:18.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Of the
biggest hunts, of when they took

00:58:18.295 --> 00:58:19.496 align:middle line:90%
down the wooly mammoth.

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: The
obstacles that were overcome.

00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:22.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:22.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes, yes.

00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:24.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong:

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So as they're reliving the story
they're empowering themselves,

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.206 align:middle line:84%
they're juicing themselves up
for the next accomplishment

00:58:29.206 --> 00:58:31.075 align:middle line:84%
so it's a very important
part of the process.

00:58:31.075 --> 00:58:32.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:58:32.443 --> 00:58:34.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: They may
also be establishing status

00:58:34.778 --> 00:58:36.947 align:middle line:90%
for themselves amongst...

00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:37.982 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers].

00:58:37.982 --> 00:58:39.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Respect they need.

00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:40.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I did
this so you can too.

00:58:40.551 --> 00:58:41.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
then there's a lesson;

00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:43.220 align:middle line:90%
they may be encouraging someone

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.189 align:middle line:84%
or they may be teaching
a method.

00:58:45.189 --> 00:58:46.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Teaching moment.

00:58:46.557 --> 00:58:48.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Giving
lessons to the younger hunts...

00:58:48.993 --> 00:58:50.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Sure.

00:58:50.094 --> 00:58:51.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...hunters and warriors.

00:58:51.328 --> 00:58:53.364 align:middle line:84%
Right? So there's these
different purposes going on,

00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:55.466 align:middle line:84%
but the most important
one to know

00:58:55.466 --> 00:58:57.835 align:middle line:90%
about is that he's refueling.

00:58:57.835 --> 00:59:01.505 align:middle line:84%
He's empowering himself and
so to him the point is not

00:59:01.505 --> 00:59:02.940 align:middle line:90%
that he's told you before.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, that will
change the way I hear stories

00:59:05.009 --> 00:59:06.010 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] forever.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:07.311 align:middle line:90%
It will.

00:59:07.311 --> 00:59:08.512 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes and
if you want to be amazing;

00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:10.214 align:middle line:90%
this is what I do with Greg.

00:59:10.214 --> 00:59:13.283 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So if he's going
around like this.

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.886 align:middle line:84%
Right? He's like
all like, bummed...

00:59:15.886 --> 00:59:17.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:59:17.087 --> 00:59:18.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...discouraged, not himself.

00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:25.663 align:middle line:84%
Right? I have been known to
say to him, "How old were you

00:59:25.663 --> 00:59:29.800 align:middle line:84%
when your dad asked you
about the paper route?"

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.201 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:59:31.201 --> 00:59:32.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And I'll
-- and I know how old he was.

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:37.107 align:middle line:84%
He's told me this story I can't
even tell you how many times

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:38.509 align:middle line:90%
since I met him 21 years ago.

00:59:38.509 --> 00:59:40.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay, but
that isn't placating?

00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:41.512 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
No, no, no, no.

00:59:41.512 --> 00:59:43.580 align:middle line:90%
That's play grounding.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.518 align:middle line:84%
That's -- I mean I'll ask
him, "So how old were you?"

00:59:47.518 --> 00:59:51.221 align:middle line:84%
And since he doesn't
think it's a reflection

00:59:51.221 --> 00:59:53.657 align:middle line:84%
of me having a faulty
memory that I don't remember

00:59:53.657 --> 00:59:57.394 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't go, "I've told
you a thousand times I was 13."

00:59:57.394 --> 00:59:59.296 align:middle line:90%
Right? He doesn't say that.

00:59:59.296 --> 01:00:02.599 align:middle line:84%
Right? He just launches
into the story and he starts

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.235 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning about
where he was and his father came

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:08.272 align:middle line:84%
in and said, "How'd you
like to earn $30 a month?"

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.874 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] And he
tells this story

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:13.377 align:middle line:90%
which is key to his identity.

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.779 align:middle line:84%
It's key to his sense
of himself as someone

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.414 align:middle line:90%
who earns money and saves money.

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Spends it very frugally...

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:22.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Bought one
candy bar and one metal car.

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:23.821 align:middle line:84%
Saved the rest and
that's how he had a $1,000

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:24.988 align:middle line:90%
by the time he was [laughter]...

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.391 align:middle line:84%
No, we have a little
bit of an opposite thing

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.792 align:middle line:90%
with my husband and I.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.862 align:middle line:84%
Is that I think I asked him if
he likes crunch peanut butter

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:34.698 align:middle line:84%
or creamy peanut butter
at least 20 times.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:35.766 align:middle line:90%
But I...

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:36.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You can't remember.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: ...I can't
remember because probably

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.105 align:middle line:84%
when he would answer me I
would be completely diffused

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.741 align:middle line:90%
and not record the answer.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So we get to
the market the next going,

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.311 align:middle line:84%
"Do you like crunchy
or creamy [laughter]?"

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's now a running joke
in our relationship.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
That's really funny.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter]
But I don't know

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.119 align:middle line:84%
if I'm the only person
that happens to.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You might have an issue

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:59.056 align:middle line:90%
with peanut butter.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:01.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter]
It's now a fun joke though.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
[Inaudible] issue

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.962 align:middle line:90%
with peanut butter [laughter].

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:08.132 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there are things that
our memories just won't hold

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:09.299 align:middle line:90%
for one reason or another.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:13.337 align:middle line:84%
Or especially, you know,
we both had children.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:14.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:15.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
That wipes out who parts

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:16.640 align:middle line:90%
of the brain [laughter].

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It does.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.442 align:middle line:90%
Really? It really does?

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:19.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Oh it really does.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:20.244 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It really does.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:21.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Yeah, just shew.

01:01:21.612 --> 01:01:25.382 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into
peri-menopause and the --

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:26.950 align:middle line:90%
enter the delete button.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh [laughter].

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Which just
[noises] [laughter] takes things

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:31.321 align:middle line:90%
right out of your brain.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:32.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It's just gone.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:33.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's just gone.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.959 align:middle line:84%
You don't even remember the
conversation [laughter].

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.361 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So that's normal?

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: It's a
function of estrogen levels.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.098 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:42.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's normal.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So when the
estrogen starts to exit

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:46.136 align:middle line:90%
so do a lot of memories?

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:46.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Oh my gosh.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:49.139 align:middle line:90%
Memories and especially --

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:52.009 align:middle line:84%
we're a magnet for
remembering commitments,

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.477 align:middle line:84%
and then we can't
remember them anymore

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:54.912 align:middle line:90%
and that's really frightening.

01:01:54.912 --> 01:02:00.784 align:middle line:84%
Or another thing that goes with
the estrogen is the compulsion

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:04.388 align:middle line:84%
to take care of other
people disappears.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.291 align:middle line:84%
And things that we used to love
to do, and want to be compelled

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.593 align:middle line:84%
to do, now are like, I don't
want to do that [laughter].

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.261 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I don't need that anymore.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.999 align:middle line:84%
As the kids go off to college,
which you're in that phase now,

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:20.437 align:middle line:84%
you start to lengthen the
leash of caring for the world.

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:21.771 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happens?

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well it --

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:25.142 align:middle line:84%
Louann Brizendine who
wrote  The Female Brain ;

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:26.410 align:middle line:90%
one of my favorite people.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: The
Neuroscientist.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.378 align:middle line:90%
She's brilliant.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:29.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
She's brilliant.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.047 align:middle line:90%
People should just read it.

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:31.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:31.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
She actually told me

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:32.916 align:middle line:90%
about the delete button

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.752 align:middle line:84%
which like I was like,
ah thank you Louann.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:39.389 align:middle line:84%
And but in her book  The Female
Brain  she talk about the care

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.459 align:middle line:84%
and tend part of the
brain turning off.

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:43.293 align:middle line:90%
And...

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The care and what?

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:45.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: It's
called care and tend.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:46.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh okay.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:47.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
And it's a part --

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.333 align:middle line:84%
the part of the brain that
compels a woman to care

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.901 align:middle line:84%
for others and tend
to their needs.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:51.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: And that

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:56.273 align:middle line:84%
as the estrogen falls
that part turns off.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the cool thing is, it can
be reactivated and activated

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.551 align:middle line:84%
for the first time by the
pheromones that babies emit.

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:10.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Ah, so that's why
grandchildren are so fabulous.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.021 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that.

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:14.391 align:middle line:90%
Grandchildren are the best.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: Well
they can be but what I love

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:18.962 align:middle line:84%
because I love choice; is
you can decide what kind

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.131 align:middle line:90%
of grandmother you want to be.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.433 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
be a, you know,

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.904 align:middle line:84%
birthday cards only grandmother
do not sniff the fumes.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.972 align:middle line:90%
Stay away [laughter].

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.742 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be a
drop them off anytime.

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
You know? Start sniffing
the fumes.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.314 align:middle line:84%
And after we learned this I
purposely [laughter] started

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.750 align:middle line:84%
holding babies and going
[sniffing] Greg needs me

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:40.617 align:middle line:90%
to cook.

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:41.551 align:middle line:84%
Greg needs me to
cook [laughter].

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:42.586 align:middle line:84%
Come on, come on
wake up, up there.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.088 align:middle line:84%
Greg needs me to
cook [laughter].

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That's great.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:47.691 align:middle line:90%
That is great.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:48.759 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if the same thing
would work with just a bottle

01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:49.426 align:middle line:90%
of baby powder [laughter].

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.761 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers].

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Why are you
sniffing the baby powder honey?

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:55.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: I don't
think it has the pheromones.

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Darn it.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:58.468 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be
great [laughter]?

01:03:58.468 --> 01:03:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: I love it.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So do these
conversations also --

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.806 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, did you finish that?

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:03.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
I didn't finish.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:04.508 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to hear the rest?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:05.976 align:middle line:90%
Go, go. Yes, yes, yes.

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:06.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Okay.

01:04:06.743 --> 01:04:08.011 align:middle line:90%
So we did the story thing.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:08.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.548 align:middle line:84%
So don't tell his
story for him to prove

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that you got the facts
straight [laughter].

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Listen.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.386 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, "Hello,
I'm your wife.

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:18.155 align:middle line:84%
You don't remember
telling me this story?

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.823 align:middle line:90%
I'm that not memorable."

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:21.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: No.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Know that it's
serving a greater purpose then.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:22.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Exactly.

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:23.961 align:middle line:90%
A greater purpose.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.896 align:middle line:84%
He's probably going to go
hunt something down for you.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:26.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Something
will happen.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:28.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:31.568 align:middle line:84%
Then the other thing which
is how hard it is to wait

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.971 align:middle line:90%
for them to answer a question.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:35.839 align:middle line:84%
So a woman will ask a man
a question [laughter].

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:38.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I think I'm
the only one this happens to.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:39.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Oh no.

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:40.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: This
is so refreshing.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:40.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: It's not.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:41.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:42.312 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:42.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
It's not you.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: So again --

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.751 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the biggest
mistakes that women make --

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%
is we think we're talking...

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: To another woman.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:51.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...to someone like us.

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:52.521 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
A kind of woman.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:55.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
A hairy woman,

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.061 align:middle line:84%
a muscly woman, a
smelly woman...

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...that we all know.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:01.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
We're not and so we tend

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:04.668 align:middle line:84%
to answer questions right
off the top of our heads.

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:07.137 align:middle line:84%
Do you know -- what do
you think about Spain?

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:07.938 align:middle line:90%
Hot [laughter].

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:09.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, right.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:10.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Right.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:11.641 align:middle line:84%
Colorful. [Laughter] Like we
just pop things off the top

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:12.976 align:middle line:90%
of our head.

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:17.381 align:middle line:84%
A man when you ask him
a question he assumes

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:20.484 align:middle line:84%
that you're committed to
the question, that you care

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:23.387 align:middle line:84%
about the answer,
and so he's going

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:26.556 align:middle line:84%
to look really what does
he think about that.

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:29.159 align:middle line:90%
So what do I think about Spain?

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:30.927 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.231 align:middle line:84%
And we call it going
to the well.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:35.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, okay.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: So he'll go
to the well, you know and reach

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.336 align:middle line:84%
down deep and pull up
his thoughts of that.

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:40.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: The
well of memories.

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:42.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: The well of
memories, the well of knowledge,

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:47.277 align:middle line:84%
information, values,
past experiences.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The well that he is
from a lifetime...

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Uh-huh.

01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...of everything he is.

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:57.621 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to the
well to pull this up,

01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:00.724 align:middle line:84%
and we're already
wandering off [laughter].

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:01.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: We're --

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.495 align:middle line:84%
I mean since he doesn't answer
right away, we either wander off

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.697 align:middle line:90%
or forget we asked a question.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:08.331 align:middle line:90%
Or...

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:10.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: ...we'll
think he didn't understand the

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:13.603 align:middle line:84%
question and we'll
rephrase it not realizing

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:17.007 align:middle line:84%
that the rephrasing is a
totally different question.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So we ask
another question completely.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:19.976 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Well like the difference

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.814 align:middle line:84%
between where do you
want to go on vacation

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and where should
we go on vacation.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Those questions are not
remotely close to each other

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.122 align:middle line:90%
but to a woman they are.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.790 align:middle line:90%
To a man they're not.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.625 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want is
purely what do I want.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:37.127 align:middle line:90%
Where do we -- where should we;

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:39.762 align:middle line:84%
well that involves
currencies, safety...

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:40.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, right.

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:42.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
...travel time, benefits.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: It
is totally different;

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.803 align:middle line:84%
where should we go, from
where do I want to go.

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:48.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Do you ever
do where do you want to go

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:51.141 align:middle line:84%
on vacation and I was
thinking about [laughter].

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:53.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
Well that's what happens.

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.378 align:middle line:84%
We say where do you
want to go on vacation?

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:58.582 align:middle line:84%
And before he can answer we go,
where should we go on vacation?

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And before we can
answer he says,

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.351 align:middle line:84%
"Should we go to
Hawaii or Spain?"

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.254 align:middle line:84%
And then he realizes he
didn't really get to vote.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:05.387 align:middle line:90%
You already [laughter] decided.

01:07:05.387 --> 01:07:09.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's just
this is so refreshing

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.962 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes I think
oh -- my husband says,

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:13.063 align:middle line:90%
"Well why did you ask me

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:14.998 align:middle line:84%
if you already know
the answer [laughter]?"

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:15.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Alison Armstrong: Yes.

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:16.333 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:17.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes,
so it's normal.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong:
You're completely normal.

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:20.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: He's
completely normal.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: His
reactions are completely normal.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We have opposite ways of
speaking and listening,

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.913 align:middle line:84%
and because we don't understand
them we end up like this

01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:33.483 align:middle line:84%
and we end up crushed
and hurt and divorced.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.584 align:middle line:90%
And all you have to do is

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
if you understand you
can just like shift.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.623 align:middle line:84%
You just shift a little and
then you can have partnership.

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Like okay, so he knows -- if
can know that you're going

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.428 align:middle line:84%
to answer off the top of
your head with no commitment

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.597 align:middle line:84%
and he may want to
check in tomorrow

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:48.798 align:middle line:84%
to see what's your
answer today [laughter].

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison Armstrong: And you
know he's really going to think

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.371 align:middle line:84%
about it you can either wait for
him to think about it and say,

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:57.240 align:middle line:84%
"I want to give you a
question for you to think about

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.576 align:middle line:84%
and let me know when you
have an answer [laughter]."

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: This is
so enormously helpful.

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember at the beginning of
the show I said if you want

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.049 align:middle line:84%
to solve the communication
issues between men

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:09.653 align:middle line:84%
and women Alison Armstrong
has so much more information.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:12.889 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have her back
again but this has just been

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.324 align:middle line:90%
so enormously helpful for me.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:15.592 align:middle line:84%
I hope [laughter] it
has for you, as well.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.662 align:middle line:84%
