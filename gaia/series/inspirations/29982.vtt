00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.504 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:10%
If you were to
tell my guest today

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:10%
when he was a boy, that he would
be the visionary leader of one

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
of the world's largest
spiritual organizations,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
with a congregation of
hundreds of thousands

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:10%
worldwide, multiple
community outreach programs

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:10%
that range from feeding
the homeless to supporting

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
human rights in
foreign countries,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:10%
he would not have
believed you back then.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, today I am
honored to be joined

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:10%
by one of the most
well-respected visionaries

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:10%
of our time, the founder of,
and the spiritual director,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Agape International
Spiritual Center,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:10%
Michael Bernard Beckwith.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.571 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say hi.

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL BECKWITH: Thank you.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.153 align:middle line:90%
It's my joy to be here with you.

00:00:57.153 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is my honor
and I am grateful.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for a long
time, and it's just so great

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.182 align:middle line:90%
to have you here with me.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So, what if somebody were
to tell you that, as a boy?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.932 align:middle line:84%
What would you
have said to them?

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: As you
said, I probably

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.473 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have believed it.

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even know
what that even was.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Even though, as a boy, you
know, there are intuitions

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:10%
and there are openings.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:10%
But from that
particular context,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:10%
you don't know what that is.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, you created it
from something that wasn't,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:10%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
You created it
from the ground up.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.568 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so, what
gave you that impetus

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to create something that
we all know now as Agape?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, for me,
I had a spiritual awakening

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:90%
back in the '70s.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I was attending USC as
a psychobiology major.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was on my path at the
time to go to medical school.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And something began
to happen to me.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I began to have these
interesting dreams

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and interesting openings.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I was
killed in a lucid dream,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and the pain was
quite excruciating.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up
from that, I could

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:84%
see that we were surrounded
by this universal presence

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
of such love and such beauty,
that loved me to my core

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
and loves everyone to its core.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And that sent me on
a path to discover

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:90%
what had happened to me.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I could never
get back in that box.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.684 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, you remember
that so vividly now?

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Oh absolutely.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Oh no,
it's like yesterday.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Gives me chills
when you said that.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: In the verb
and the feeling tone

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and the enthusiasm that
happened at that moment,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
for me to discover and
rediscover my real self,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is still there
when I wake up now.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, one thing led to
another--study, meditation,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
prayer, study,
meditation, prayer,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
ultimately becoming a
spiritual therapist.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And then answering a
call to do a larger work,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
going through the resistance
within myself to do that,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
wanting to stay where
I was, and then.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To be safe.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Be safe, secure.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, the energy

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that wants to evolve
through you becomes

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:84%
stronger than the
resistance in you.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And, Agape was born
from that vision.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From your living room.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember the stories of you
in your living room, talking

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and having these meetings,
just prayer groups,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.915 align:middle line:90%
just as many have.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But it kept growing
and growing because it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
was, I mean if you think,
this is your purpose.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.542 align:middle line:90%
This is you living your destiny.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.637 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a destiny, and
a dimension of my destiny

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
was to call a group
of people together

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
to start a vision
group, in which we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.605 align:middle line:90%
asked a very powerful question.

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, what
would we have to become,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to manifest
this community

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love?

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So the question helped us grow
and unfold and actually evolve

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to become the vehicles
through which this idea could

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for people
that may not know Agape,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the philosophy,
the nondenominational

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
philosophy that you
created basically.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well,
basically we call

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
it a transdenominational
spiritual community, which

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
means it goes
beyond denomination,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
cuts across beyond
denominations,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and embraces the spiritual
truths of all the sacred paths.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're keenly aware that
this presence that we call God,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
love, intelligence is
everywhere in its fullness.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And that we are its image.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
We are its likeness.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And that we have the capacity
to reflect and to reveal it.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We have the capacity to
reflect and reveal the cosmos

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
in a way that has
never happened before.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, through affirmative
prayer, meditation, life

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
visioning, we seek
to open ourselves up

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.802 align:middle line:84%
to the infinite
possibilities within us

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to make a mighty
difference on the planet

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.969 align:middle line:84%
during our time of
our incarnation.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.134 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because those things
that you just mentioned

00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
are universal, truly with
all religions, aren't they?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Through affirmative
prayer, and visioning.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.385 align:middle line:84%
That's really what all religion
does in some form or another,

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.431 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well,
ultimately religion

00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to take us
to a spiritual encounter,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
an existential encounter,
with the Absolute,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:90%
with the Presence.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not to keep us in
a dogmatic believing

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:90%
of a particular religion.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a vehicle
to the transcendent.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, we wanted to develop
a community of individuals

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that would come and participate
in their own unfolding,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
discover their gifts,
give them to the world,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
be a beneficial
presence on the planet.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And kind of make a
vow that the world

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
would be better
before we left it.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's
statistics out there that

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
say 90 something
percent of people

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
believe in God, a
God of some type.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But yet people are moving
away from organized religion,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.934 align:middle line:90%
statistically.

00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the US, at least.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.764 align:middle line:84%
Have you found that
amongst your congregation?

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
those people are

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the ones that seem to
find you online, as well?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Here there's an online
presence, as well.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, we
have the survivors

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of traditional religion, people
who walked away from religion.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have individuals who
used to call themselves atheist.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We have individuals who
would check the box, none,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
if, in fact, they say, what
religion do you belong to?

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But they did believe
in a higher power.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They believe that there
was some cosmic force that

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:90%
was behind everything.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have all those
people in one room.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Plus we have the Buddhists,
the Sikhs, the Christians,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the Muslims--all there
in the same room,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
celebrating the Divine Presence
that's within all of us.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And developing a
spiritual practice

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that allows them,
on a daily basis,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to be a candidate for
what I call an existential

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.072 align:middle line:84%
encounter with the
Divine, with the Presence.

00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.717 align:middle line:84%
And being in the community
there, it is so spirit-raising,

00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and the music ministry and
everything that comes with it

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
is great.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You've had the opportunity to
have audiences with several

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
of the leaders of our
country, because they've

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.309 align:middle line:84%
caught on to what you're
doing as being something that

00:06:55.309 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is, not only progressive, but
has made a mark in this world.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.635 align:middle line:84%
You had a meeting with Obama,
before he was President

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
or was it the end of his so

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: No, that was when
he was running the first time.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: First time, OK.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: There
was a private meeting

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of certain spiritual
leaders, it was

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.926 align:middle line:90%
about a block from my house.

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was convenient.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And so, he
had a private meeting

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
with some of the ministers
and spiritual leaders there.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And then he had a larger meeting
with about 100 people speaking

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
about his particular plan,
his particular decorations,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:90%
his particular vision.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
when I heard him speak

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things he
said that really got me,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.495 align:middle line:84%
I told Rickie, I
said, OK I'm in.

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, uh huh.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:90%
See, I remember that.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:90%
That was a very important time.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have a photo
of that, of you,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and that is your wife,
Rickie Byars Beckwith, who

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
is also the musical
director at the

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.705 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Music and
Arts Director at Agape.

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:54.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At Agape.

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: The musical
genius of our time.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a look at her

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and hear some of
her music later.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.486 align:middle line:84%
And then, we also have a
picture of you with Rosa Parks.

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:90%
This is a little while ago.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Little while ago.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Oh yeah,
my hair was short.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
She came to Agape
a couple of times,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.914 align:middle line:84%
and also Coretta Scott
King came and Yolanda King,

00:08:11.914 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the eldest daughter of
Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and Coretta Scott.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.419 align:middle line:90%
She was a member of Agape.

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I remember.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: So, she was there.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:10%
We've had the privilege of
hosting and being with people

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:10%
who got us, who understood that,
though our spiritual community

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:10%
was so-called off
the beaten path,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:10%
once they came and
they heard the message,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:10%
they felt the music,
they felt our desire

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:10%
to make a difference
on the planet,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:10%
they got what we were about.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And we were highly endorsed
by some very powerful people.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you are making
a difference on the planet.

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:45.482 align:middle line:84%
This is another picture of
you with a past President.

00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You
know when that was?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
That was, that was his
last term in office.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And he called a special
meeting of ministers,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
basically saying
what would happen

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:84%
if the wrong regime
got in office.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He basically said, we will
be in a war within a year,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and that the country
would be bankrupt.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: And he was correct.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.402 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that at
the end of this term?

00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what was
he asking of you?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.215 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: He was asking us to
make sure that we got the vote

00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:16.805 align:middle line:84%
out and make sure that
people really stood up and--

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There was nothing
we could have done.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, you know,
that's other dialogue because

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:21.563 --> 00:09:23.769 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: The Supreme
Court picked a President,

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.269 align:middle line:84%
so at that particular time we
didn't really have democracy.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now, it's interesting.

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
That was an interesting time.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.195 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side of
the political spectrum,

00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
you have a meeting with His
Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: I've
had the privilege,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.875 align:middle line:84%
I'm the president of the
Association for Global New

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Thought.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And for a couple
of years in a row,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
we had something called the
Synthesis Dialogues that

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.995 align:middle line:84%
was partly hosted by His
Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So, we would meet
every couple of years

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.904 align:middle line:84%
and I had the privilege
to facilitate meetings

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
with spiritual leaders,
and the world leaders,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:90%
with His Holiness.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What has
come out of that?

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think that
we can truly change wars

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
with congregations of
thought and intentionality?

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, what is
happening is that as every

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
individual has an intention
to touch into the realm

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:84%
of peace--and peace is not
the absence of war--peace is

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:90%
a quality all of its own.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I call it the dynamic, the
dynamic of harmonizing good.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And as people evolve into
that particular space,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
you see an evolution moving from
warmongering, tribalism, hate,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
moving from the reptilian
brain into a much more

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
peaceful co-existence.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It is happening, but
like anything, it

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen overnight.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking
me, do I believe

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that is someone
holding a vision,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.176 align:middle line:84%
someone praying, someone
changing themselves

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
from within out, does
that make a difference?

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely it does.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We look at Dr.
Martin Luther King,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Jr. Dr. King did not
say, ladies and gentlemen

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I have a complaint.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, I have a dream.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.067 align:middle line:84%
And because of that dream,
people galvanized around it

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and differences were made.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:90%
So, in that same sense,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over time.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: As more
and more people

00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:11.219 align:middle line:84%
have a dream, a vision
about the possibility of us,

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
we have to talk about it.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to walk
in that direction.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Changes are being made.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
the power is in numbers?

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that some of
the intention experiments

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:90%
are actually working?

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing with
Agape and bringing it

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.032 align:middle line:84%
to an online audience, is
that making a difference?

00:11:27.032 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I think it's yes and yes.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:90%
The numbers, here's the deal.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
All thoughts aren't
created equal.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
A thought that's emerging from
a field of unity, of love,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
connectedness, that
thought is way more

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful than a thought that's
emerging from a field of fear,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
doubt, and worry.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not equal.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
When you do biofeedback on
someone, and they're anxious

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and they feel fear, the thought
forms have a lower amplitude.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.232 align:middle line:90%
They are in the beta range.

00:11:57.232 --> 00:11:59.065 align:middle line:84%
An individual that's
in meditation or prayer

00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and having a sense of peace, the
thought is a higher frequency.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It's way more powerful.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can have less people,
vibrating at a higher level,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
making a bigger difference
than a lot of people

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:90%
vibrating at a lower level.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
So, it does make a difference.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about, there is
a tipping point in numbers,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's not as much
as people think.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain percentage
of the population,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:84%
if a certain percentage
of the population

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
go out of time, meaning they're
in meditation, they're singing,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
they're in chant, they're
in prayer, they're in study,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
they're in fellowship, it
affects the larger community.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Because a small group of
people in a field of unity

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
are way more powerful than
a large group of people

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
in a field of separation.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it would create,
I'm sure, a vibrational match,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.101 align:middle line:84%
because that would go beyond
just the amount of people

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
praying.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure if the amplitude
is high, it would--

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.576 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Create a
higher vibration.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.074 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Nothing
can separate,

00:12:53.074 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:90%
it goes through walls.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.948 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's non-local,

00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:55.722 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:55.722 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: So us
sitting here right now,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and talking about peace, and
having an awareness of peace

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
is affecting somebody in another
part of this city, that's

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:90%
not even tuning in to us.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
They're having a thought
about forgiveness.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They're having a thought
about making a better choice.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
They're having a thought
about being more patient.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:90%
But where's that coming from?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from people who are
sitting in prayer, meditation,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
people having a conversation,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.332 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:21.332 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And it's
affecting the neurosphere,

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the mental atmosphere,
of the planet.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And then also, when you
get involved with music,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
it kind of, I know when
you add emotion to anything

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:90%
it intensifies it.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
If it's positive and uplifting
and uprising emotion,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
like you create with the
ministry, the music ministry,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:90%
at Agape.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the highlights
for me in going--that you can

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:84%
also experience that it's just
to get that vibration of music

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a
huge fan of music.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.681 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I'm a huge fan?

00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:90%
You're a huge fan of music.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.323 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I'm the biggest fan.

00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you are.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yes, have
the privilege and honor

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that love to have the
Rickie BB, who's I dare say,

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the musical
geniuses of our time.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
In terms of composition,
arrangement, and she

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
catches sound,
and the vibration,

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and turns them into songs.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing
thing, and I always

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
try to remind the Agape
Nation that we can't take this

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:90%
for granted.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.422 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when you see
a genius at work, it looks easy.

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, she
makes it look easy.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: But in fact,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.283 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's part
of the reason why.

00:14:29.283 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, but
that facility is, everyone

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:90%
can't do that.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.389 align:middle line:84%
Some people sit down for hours
and years, trying to do a song.

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying she
doesn't have songs

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that she's worked on for
long periods of time,

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
but often it's kind of an
eruption of the spirit.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So, it is.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It's infused.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:90%
It's channeled, if you will.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I see the same
thing happen to you

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
when you are in the
congregation and talking.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.354 align:middle line:84%
If a vibration happens,
the tonality changes.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've
heard this before,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
but what happens to you when you
feel that elevation of spirit

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:90%
coming through you?

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's like, it's
like, I become very blank.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm filled with
this presence of love.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I love everyone in
the congregation.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:90%
The information is flowing.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have the privilege
to articulate it,

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
to be as available
as I can to give it

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
some fluency, some
articulation, some power.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's Michael,
it's using Michael,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and so it has my Michael-isms
and my personality

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and everything that Michael is.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But I'm keenly aware
that something,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm touching something,
transcended to the personality.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not based
on memorization,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:90%
it's not based on practice.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on things I've
studied, even though I have

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
studied, and things of
that particular nature.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a moment of being
available to the energy that

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
wants to use us all.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.125 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a
capacity for genius

00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
in some area of their life.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a powerful destiny.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we
tap into a little,

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.589 align:middle line:84%
an ounce of what you have
become so well-gifted

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and practiced with doing?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we tap into
an ounce of that?

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
How do we make ourselves
that open and available?

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That
spiritual practice, there

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.997 align:middle line:90%
has to be an intentionality.

00:16:25.997 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to want it.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.363 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: You see.

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And generally
speaking, I sometimes

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
will tell people that
the nation and the world

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.477 align:middle line:84%
suffers from intention
deficit disorder.

00:16:37.477 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
People don't have any intention.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they've
inherited their intention

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
from the society
in which they live,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
which is primarily an
acquisition, consumption,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
consumer society.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And often times people
don't have the intention

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:90%
to activate their genius.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.783 align:middle line:84%
They don't have an
intention for creativity.

00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
intention to let

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
their life be a work of art.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way they think.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So it begins with intention.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And then from
intention, you have

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:84%
to develop a level
of spiritual practice

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:84%
where you become a
candidate for an insight.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And an insight is an event that
takes place in consciousness,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly you
are aware of something

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:90%
you didn't know before.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And I say everyone
has that capacity.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The presence, whatever
name you want to call it,

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:90%
the Presence of God.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Love, Intelligence has
not made one mistake,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.829 align:middle line:84%
does not do do-overs,
does not repeat itself,

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and everyone is fully
endowed with the capacity

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.405 align:middle line:84%
to have insight, to allow
for their soul to evolve

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and their oversoul to unfold.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So though,
not necessarily

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're in a place of
fear and survival so much,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is what do you hear
as the biggest angst

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that people have in
your congregation?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%
That source of fear?

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.042 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, at
Agape they don't have any.

00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I think as it's a low-level
fear that people live from,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
some of it's manufactured
by mass media.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a fear of
survive, a fear of dying,

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
a fear of lack,
loss, limitation.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a low-level fear that
people are hypnotized in.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You turn on corporate
media, and you'll

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.286 align:middle line:84%
notice there's always
something to be afraid of.

00:18:15.286 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
There's some new disease coming,
there's a terrorist happening,

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
there's always
something going on.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.812 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that may be true.

00:18:20.812 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, those do exist.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.311 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah,
those things exist.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
However, more
important than that,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
the capacity within us to
deal with whatever issue

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than what
we may be facing.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
The power within us is
bigger than anything

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that we may be
facing in the world.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
If there's a problem
in the world,

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
the answer has
already been created.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
within us, but you

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:90%
can't get to it through fear.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
You can only get to it through
revelation and inspiration.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
transcend the fear

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:84%
or walk in the
direction of your faith

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.582 align:middle line:84%
and take the fear with
you, until it translates,

00:18:56.582 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
transmutes itself into
excitement and then ultimately

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:90%
enthusiasm.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So whatever
we have inside of us

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is much larger
than the fear that

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
is being touted to us all over.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And people see
themselves as victims.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves
as unresourceful.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:90%
They see themselves as lacking.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And holding that particular
vision of themselves,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
they develop compulsive
behaviors, defense mechanisms,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and coping mechanisms to live
with that idea of themselves

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and then try to go out
and make themselves happy.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.662 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:19:30.662 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
your idea of yourself.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to catch
that you really

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
are a magnificent, luminous
being, full to overflowing

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:90%
with life and brilliance.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.204 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to fall
in love with that,

00:19:44.204 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:90%
then something else happens.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.087 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel and hear
the guidance that's there.

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.885 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: But as you
used the word earlier,

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a
vibrational match.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And so as you begin to
fall in love with yourself,

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
suddenly your intuition
starts to work.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:84%
You start to hear things, not
audibly, guidance, wisdom.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
That starts to generate
the gifts within you,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.742 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly openings
are happening,

00:20:07.742 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
opportunities are
taking place, you

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
are meeting different
people, and suddenly

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
the issue that was so big,
an answer is showing up.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's how it happens.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Out of you.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.203 align:middle line:84%
That is pretty much the formula
right there for how it happens

00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
is you have to be the
vibrational match for it.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.158 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:20:23.158 --> 00:20:26.564 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually have a video
of Agape and the experience

00:20:26.564 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
just because we've been
talking about it here.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get a chance
to take a look at what

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the experience is
for people when they

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:90%
come to this vibrational match.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.284 align:middle line:90%

>>NARRATOR: Michael
Beckwith's life

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
is a living testament to
building spiritual community.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Having journeyed through
teachings of East and West,

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
he evoked a vision of a
transdenominational spiritual

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Based upon his faith
and that vision,

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:84%
he founded the Agape
International Spiritual Center.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Dedicated to the end
of human suffering,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Agape is a global community
that recognizes, honors,

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and nurtures the dignity and
uniqueness of all peoples.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They embrace the
transformational and

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary impulse
of our planet

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
through spiritual
practice, sacred service,

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.794 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:21:22.794 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Thousands gather weekly
to receive inspiration

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
at the Agape International
Spiritual Center

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
as Doctor Beckwith aspires
to cultivate a heart of love

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:90%
as wide as the world.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
He shares this aspiration
with communities abroad,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
participating on international
panels with some of the most

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
advanced spiritual thinkers
alive, including His Holiness,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama of Tibet, Dr.

Lanka, and Aurn Gandhi,
grandson of Mohandas K. Gandhi.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Beckwith has received
numerous humanitarian awards,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
including the 2004 Africa Peace

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.213 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Beckwith, his mission,
and the world of evolve,

GlobalWorks develops
and furthers

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the Agape's international
outreach programs.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
GlobalWorks bridges gaps
between continents and cultures,

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
building affiliations with
organizations that share

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
its compassionate vision in
generating international unity.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.153 align:middle line:84%
Agape- a community, a

00:22:40.153 --> 00:22:41.236 align:middle line:90%
of evolving consciousness.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've created quite an
incredible organization there.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.362 align:middle line:84%
So what you teach
and what you have

00:22:48.362 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:84%
through all of the different
ministries-- and I did mention

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
there's many
different ministries

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.503 align:middle line:84%
from the music to
feeding the homeless

00:22:53.503 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:90%
to helping foreign countries.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
There's even a children's
ministry there.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can bring
your kids, and they

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.864 align:middle line:84%
can do things that are related
towards goodness as well.

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.321 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you had
mentioned something key

00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:90%
before is that answer is in us.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:90%
It is within you.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Where do we forget that?

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
At what point does that
get programmed out?

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.055 align:middle line:84%
Because it definitely
isn't the norm.

00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: No.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that when, as a child,
most children their imagination

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:90%
is unfettered.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have what we
call the beginner's mind.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And they dream big.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
They have gigantic possibilities
that are in front of them.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And little by little, we
teach them to be serious

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:84%
about the world and
about their survival.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
shrink their dream.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what happens
is, not only does their dream

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:84%
shrink and fear is injected
about their future,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
but then they, somewhere
along the line,

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
we pick up the idea that our
good is outside of ourselves.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And that the answers are
outside of ourselves,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
even the educational
system, if we

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
want to call it that, it's
the form of kind of a banking

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
education where we try to
put things into children,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying
to pull them out.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they have to spit
them out on test and so forth.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: So it's
an antiquated system

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:90%
that we're living under.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So you put all that
together, and you end up

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
having adults that are living
life looking for the answers

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:90%
outside of themselves.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:84%
They have-- their vision is not
bigger than their television

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:90%
screen.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeking
mainly to survive.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, fortunately,
what the universe

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
has for them is an existential
crisis, midlife crises which

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
generally is the evolutionary
impulse trying to break them

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:84%
through the small vision that
they have about themselves.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if they
don't anesthetize--

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anesthetize
themselves against it.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH:
--against the crisis.

00:24:53.655 --> 00:24:56.355 align:middle line:84%
They can wake up,
and say, oh, my God.

00:24:56.355 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been sleeping
my whole life.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.354 align:middle line:84%

00:24:58.854 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's
time to wake up.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so when
people become adults,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.108 align:middle line:84%
they come to an organization
like yours, and they say, wow.

00:25:04.108 --> 00:25:05.051 align:middle line:90%
I have forgotten this.

00:25:05.051 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:90%

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Did that happen
to you as a child?

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Did you forget that
you were the answer.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I think we all do.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I can remember when
I was very young

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.576 align:middle line:84%
having certain experiences
and then seeking to be normal.

00:25:19.576 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I can remember at
the age of 11, having

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
a very transcended experience
around my 11th birthday.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware that
something was happening in me.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to shrink it
to make sure I was still--

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fit in.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.631 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Fit in.

00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I can remember at 16 I was
on radio program called

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
"Teens Stay in School."

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And when that red light
went on going live,

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.757 align:middle line:84%
I remember this energy
flowing through me.

00:25:46.757 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was articulating all
these wonderful things.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:90%
And I learn how to normalize it.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But then when I had
the awakening when

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I was in college, I could never
get back in the box again.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The box shattered, and
the rest of my life

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
was spent discovering this
gift that's within us all.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.024 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I think we all forget.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
We all forget.

there's trauma that

great piece that you did.

of challenge and change,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
there are key
questions many share.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:90%
How could we prosper and grow?

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Do research for meaning
or grasp for survival?

>>BECKWITH: Something
within you knows

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that there are answers to
those profound question.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to evolve.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.265 align:middle line:90%

was there on this particular--

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Oh, you were there?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I was there.

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I was in the balcony,
and I watched.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And will.i.am
performed, and that

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
was-- that was an
amazing experience.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you have gone on
to teach many people.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And your message has been
well-received by millions

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
across the country
which I'm so glad to see

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:90%
that people are waking up.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And do you get a good
response from that?

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Oh, yeah.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:84%
That continues to show,
as a matter of fact.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: It's still playing.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, we needed that.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I want to also talk
to a lot more about what

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
is going on with our
state of affairs in terms

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
of the prophecies we're
hearing out there about 2012

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and what types of
fears that we are going

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:90%
to be anticipating in the news.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel that
we can be prepared

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to work against those or not
even against is maybe the word.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It's to--

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: I think people,
traditionally, are always

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
preparing themselves
for worst case

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
scenarios, the rainy
day, the negative.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.099 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
now have to learn

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to lift their vibration
and prepare for something

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
bigger than their
imagination, something greater

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:84%
than they've ever
thought of before.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.690 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the last
30 years on our planet,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.400 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, you would have to
go into a little small occult

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.734 align:middle line:90%
bookstore to find this teaching.

00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:25.108 align:middle line:84%
And then, you
would hide the book

00:28:25.108 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't want
people to think you're crazy.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
If people said, if you
said you meditated,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:90%
people would say what's that?

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say,
you don't meditate?

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.071 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:34.071 --> 00:28:34.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:34.653 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And
metaphysical and mystical

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.791 align:middle line:84%
teachings, it's a
billion dollar industry.

00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So within the last
30 years, there's

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:84%
been a great shift
that hasn't come

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
with tremendous celebration.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.887 align:middle line:84%
It's just come very,
very naturally.

00:28:49.887 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hold that's
thought one quick second

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
hear more about that.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go onto a
whole life visioning process.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.703 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
take a quick break.

00:28:56.703 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we'll be back
with Reverend Michael Bernard

I'm Lisa Garr.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.203 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:29:03.203 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is Michael
Bernard Beckwith

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.599 align:middle line:84%
from the Agape International
Spiritual Center.

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about-- before the break,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I asked Michael about
what do you expect

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.062 align:middle line:84%
to come in all the prophecies
that are set for 2012

00:29:35.062 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the fear
that we're hearing

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
in the media and the
movies and all that.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth?

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:10%
>>BECKWITH: Well,
as I was saying,

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:10%
you've seen a sweet shift
happened over the last 30

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.615 align:middle line:10%
years, and that's
going to continue.

00:29:45.615 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:10%
It's just going to
be the heightened.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.649 align:middle line:10%
Whenever an
individual-- I'll deal

00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:10%
with it on an
individual level first.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:10%
Whenever an
individual meditates,

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:10%
a moment of meditation means
you've gone out of time.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:10%
So when people are talking
about the end of time,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:10%
they're talking about
a group of people--

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.284 align:middle line:10%
there's enough
people because you

00:30:04.284 --> 00:30:05.724 align:middle line:10%
asked this earlier
about numbers.

00:30:05.724 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
That means is enough
people on the planet that

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
are going out of
the phase of time.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you go out
of the phase of time,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:84%
inspiration happens and the
next stage of evolution occurs.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So this end of the
Mayan calendar,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:84%
this particular time
in human history,

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is a moment in which you have
a number of people going out

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
of time that allows
for the next stage

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to be birthed in a very
powerful and wonderful way.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, things won't
happen overnight,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
but you'll see the subtle
shifts, particularly

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
people who have eyes to
see and ears to hear.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You'll see subtle
shifts on the planet.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The destruction and the
dissolution of systems

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that don't work
and in the emerging

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:84%
of systems that are more
sustainable and more blissful.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the stage
we're in right now.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.477 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:30:50.477 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is the stage.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.324 align:middle line:90%
How long does that stage last?

00:30:53.324 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: We're
talking about hundreds

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:90%
of years of unfoldment.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But major-- you think right now
things that are anathema to us,

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.665 align:middle line:90%
slavery, child abuse.

00:31:05.665 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:84%
A number of years
ago, they were normal.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.904 align:middle line:90%
It was normal to work a kid.

00:31:09.904 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It was normal for
people to have slaves.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It was normal for
women to not vote.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
That's changed within
a short period of time.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, the next stretch, you
have the rise of the feminine.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
You have the women now rising up
in their power and their love.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.357 align:middle line:84%
You have the masculine
and feminine energy

00:31:26.357 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:90%
being more balanced.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking
at a whole new world

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:90%
in a very short period of time.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
we'll see a female president

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:90%
at some point?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I hope so.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just a random question.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I really never
heard the meditation

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
described as going
into a different time.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: There's no time.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Time is
a mental construct

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%
that bends back upon itself.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the measure of experience.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.304 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't really
exist as an absolute.

00:31:52.304 --> 00:31:53.845 align:middle line:84%
The past, the present,
and the future

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.542 align:middle line:90%
are happening simultaneously.

00:31:55.542 --> 00:31:57.875 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a moment of
meditation, you not in time

00:31:57.875 --> 00:31:58.375 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.475 align:middle line:90%
You're in eternity.

00:31:59.475 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
And eternity is not a long time.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Eternity simply is.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've been really
working on creating

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.584 align:middle line:90%
in that space of timelessness.

00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because when you create
where there is no linear time,

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%
it's boundless.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Nonlinear dynamics
show that there's

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
a time-- the eternal
now is right here.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.959 align:middle line:90%
It's right now.

00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment of
insight, a moment of prayer,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
moment of meditation,
really, you're not in time.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And great artists,
great composers,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
great choreographers, great
architects, great healers

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
catch the eternal and then
bring the eternal into time.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see a masterpiece
that brings awe to you.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you're seeing the
eternal, breaking into time.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a great athlete,
going into the zone.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the eternal,
breaking into time.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, now,
you have Gaiam TV.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
You have all these other books
and artists and people teaching

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
in their own particular
way, bringing people

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:90%
into this sweet space.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is going
to break into time

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:90%
at an exponentially greater way.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And so life will change.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities that lie
within us, the Genius Code that

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
lies within us
will be activated.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see art,
beauty, right education,

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:90%
the unfoldment of the soul.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's beginning to happen.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You paint such a
beautiful vision of the future.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:10%
And I do believe
it is also here.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:10%
>>BECKWITH: It's here and now.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
the program by saying,

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that years ago I
caught a vision that

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
led me to be a point of
founding of this Agape

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Center for that vision.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what I saw.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I see.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So I don't hold the doom
and gloom vibration.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying the birth
is going to be pretty.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying birth is
not going to be intense.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying birth is
not going to be messy.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.021 align:middle line:84%
But there will be
a beautiful birth.

00:33:58.021 --> 00:33:59.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Birth of this
new civilization.

00:33:59.645 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This new--

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Ageless.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But we have to consciously
participate in it.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.922 align:middle line:90%
That's the caveat.

00:34:05.922 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to consciously
participate.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to just happen.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.232 align:middle line:84%
Because 2012 happens, and
December 21 takes place--

00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're not
going to wake up,

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and it will be
the angel singing.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: No.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.983 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
the practicality of it

00:34:16.983 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
because you bring that into--
when you talk about the light

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.920 align:middle line:84%
visioning process, and you talk
about how to really take us

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of on a stair step to the
next level, to that unfoldment

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:90%
What is the basis of the book?

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And you have a whole
video that you've done,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:90%
a DVD on spiritual--

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: There's
a set of six CDs

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and another set of two
CDs with a workbook.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And the book is called
"Life Visioning."

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The film is actually,
the DVD's also on Gaiam TV.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That's
"Spiritual Liberation."

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's "Spiritual-- OK.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.723 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah.

00:34:49.723 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all good.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's a
lot of good work.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:90%
It

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is a lot of good work.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: But in the
life visioning process,

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:84%
which is how I founded
Agape, I used the life

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:90%
visioning process.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you establish a
field of unconditional love.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:90%
We've all tasted it to a degree.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's loved us
without any conditions.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whatever condition
we were in, they loved us,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe a grandparent.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:90%
It may have been friend.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
If we've never felt that,
we have to imagine it.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But we establish a field
of unconditional love.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And then, we ask a question.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:84%
What is God's idea of
itself as our life?

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of asking it
is, what is it that within me

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.492 align:middle line:84%
that's seeking to
emerge by means of me?

00:35:32.492 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing is that the universe

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.410 align:middle line:84%
answers any questions
that you ask.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.004 align:middle line:10%
However, many people ask
disempowering questions.

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Such as?

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BECKWITH: Why me?

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:10%
What's wrong?

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.840 align:middle line:10%
Who's to blame?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:10%
People stay at that level.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:10%
But if you raise it
up and say, what's

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:10%
trying to emerge through me?

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:84%
You start to get
into intuitive hits

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
about your own soul
that's seeking to unfold.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So in the life
visioning process,

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to ask that
question and be still enough

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and develop the
listening capacity

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.460 align:middle line:90%
to hear with the inner ear.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Then, once we're able
to articulate the vision

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to a degree, that's
just stage one and two.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Third stage is, we
have to ask, what

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is it that I must
become in order

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the vision that
I'm now learning to articulate.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's our growing edge.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
That means, we're starting to
see where we need to change,

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
where we need to take
personal self-responsibility

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:90%
for our own life.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Habits we need to drop.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Habits we need to develop.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Gifts we need to cultivate.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Where must I grow?

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever
noticed that people

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
come into the community,
and they act a certain way.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And they believe.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And they love the
messages, but there's

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:84%
a disconnect when life
happens, when they go back

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:90%
to the job and the stress.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.362 align:middle line:90%
How do you bridge that gap?

00:36:56.362 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's like
an Olympic athlete.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:90%
You have to practice.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't just suddenly
one day wake up

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and run the 100-yard
dash in under 10 seconds.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a day by day practice
that allows for the potential

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:09.917 align:middle line:90%
to come forward.

00:37:09.917 --> 00:37:11.666 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're an
artist or whether you're

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
a singer, a piano
player, whatever it is,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:90%
you have to practice.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:90%
So you have the theory.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.300 align:middle line:90%
You have a belief.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the belief is what I call
an operational placeholder

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.342 align:middle line:90%
for practice and insight.

00:37:23.342 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You believe that all
things are possible.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
You believe there's
a vision within you.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.086 align:middle line:84%
But now, you have to
have a level of practice.

00:37:29.086 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So a life visioning
process helps

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
you practice so
that you're provided

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:90%
with ultimately an insight.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, you start to
embody that insight.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%
You start to grow.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
there's people that come.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And they get excited about it.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But when they realize
that you're not

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:84%
going to ride to heaven on the
coattails of someone else--

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And there's
not magical thinking.

00:37:55.085 --> 00:37:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not wishful thinking.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have
to do some inner work.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's a group
that drops off there.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to stop
the conversations also.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:90%
The chatter.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.038 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The negative chatter.

00:38:07.038 --> 00:38:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And the surrounding
yourself with people

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that support the
negative chatter

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.042 align:middle line:84%
and being a part of that
conversation as well.

00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I notice that as
I grew spiritually that

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:84%
my set of friends
completely changed.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: As you change,
the vibrational match changes.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So then you have
another group of people

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
that match who you are today.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.451 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I was
a part of that conversation

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
in the past because that
was where I was resonating,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.087 align:middle line:90%
in complaint or in victimhood.

00:38:35.087 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
poverty consciousness

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I was creating within
my spirit at the time.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that set of friends

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:84%
was that vibrational match,
and as I grew spiritually,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have this
conversation with those people.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And it hurt because I was
losing friends and having

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:90%
confrontations.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was uncomfortable.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And that's
part of the messy birth

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:90%
on an individual level.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:84%
What you're describing
there is the transformation

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
takes place individually.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So going back to your previous
question on the global sense,

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.100 align:middle line:90%
that's what happens globally.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.890 align:middle line:84%
That as more and more people
are coming into an intention

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to grow, develop,
and unfold, then,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
the world changes and things,
systems that used to work,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.440 align:middle line:90%
no longer work.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Things that used
to be sustainable,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.571 align:middle line:90%
no longer sustainable.

00:39:20.571 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.581 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: So in that
third stage, we're saying,

00:39:23.581 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:90%
what must we become.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, we ask what gifts
do we already have to share.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, we ask,
what must I let

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:84%
go of that no longer
serves where I'm going?

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
questions that allow

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:84%
us to take the responsibility
for our own life.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you've indicated, when
people realize, oh, my God.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.846 align:middle line:90%
I've got to change.

00:39:43.846 --> 00:39:44.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:44.346 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.283 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Or when
an issue comes up,

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and they think, oh, it was a lot
better when I had problems when

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I could anesthetize myself with
shopping, happy hour, whatever

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:90%
the drug of choice is.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you could
never told me at that time

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that I was attracting the bad
situations I was in because

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.480 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I was attracting
the wrong business partner,

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:08.709 align:middle line:84%
or I was attracting the
wrong set of circumstances.

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You could have never
told me that was

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:90%
me that was attracting that.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.338 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah.

00:40:11.338 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Because you weren't to blame.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Ignorance is always to blame.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
It's never the individual.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just that an
individual doesn't know.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at those
particular things

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:84%
as initiation, rather than
you made a horrible mistake.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Or if something bad
happened to you as a kid.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Those are points of initiations
where you get to learn

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and activate certain
gifts within you,

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
certain talents,
certain strengths

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that that particular condition
is bringing out of you.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love
that, initiations.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:84%
That's a good way
of looking back.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm able to look back now.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
perspective on all of it now.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this space
I'm in now is what

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.790 align:middle line:90%
you call spiritual liberation.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
call that place where

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I have freedom to be really
truly authentically who I am.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And not afraid of it,
not preachy about it,

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:90%
but just to be it.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- when you start
to touch spiritual liberation,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
free from something.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.600 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
people are just

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.016 align:middle line:84%
trying to get free
from something.

00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I want to get free from hate.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to get free from fear.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.860 align:middle line:90%
I want to get free from lack.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But as you begin
to grow, it's more

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:90%
of a freedom to be something.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a freedom to be
rather than freedom from.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And in spiritual liberation,
now your pulled by a vision.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
teach in spiritual liberation

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and in life visioning
is that we're pulled.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:84%
We're pushed by pain until
we're pulled by a vision.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And so once liberation
starts to happen within you,

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:84%
you start to be more
pulled by a vision

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.836 align:middle line:90%
rather than pushed by pain.

00:41:49.836 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So even though there still
maybe pain in your life,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the world of phenomena
is still doing its thing,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you're vision is what
wakes you up every morning.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
where I see we are

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:84%
at the culture is that there's
still the push by paint.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
There's civil unrest
in the Middle East.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.470 align:middle line:90%
There's natural disasters.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:84%
There's devastation
all around us.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But there's a vision that is
calling, that is in the future.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's here, and we get
glimpses of it now.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But then, how do you
suggest that we do deal

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.549 align:middle line:84%
with that civil unrest
and the bombings and--

00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well,
first of all, there

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is-- that type of cantankerous
behavior is in the Middle East,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's also in other
parts of the world.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We focus-- that's where we
on focus all the time, what's

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.635 align:middle line:84%
happening with Palestine and
Israel and the Middle East.

00:42:37.635 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
But we can go to
parts of Africa.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:90%
We can go to the Congo.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We can go all around
the world and find

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:84%
very similar kind
of civil unrest.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's happening.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:84%
However, if you look back at
the arc of human civilization,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
we have less wars on the planet
now than any time in history,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:84%
less war than any
time in human history.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%
So something has shifted.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're putting
a magnifying glass

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:90%
on where the negativity is.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting that this
is the greatest time we've ever

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.240 align:middle line:90%
experience as a human race.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have greater technology,
so we can see the negativity.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're asking, how
do we deal with that?

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that
perspective though.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.348 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with it?

00:43:18.348 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: So first of all,
from the individual level,

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask ourselves,
where is the Middle East

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:90%
raging in my mind?

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Where are the land mines
of hate, unforgiveness?

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Where am I holding grudges?

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Where am I lacking
compassion and not

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:84%
seeing the other's perspective
and other's perception?

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Where am I totally right,
and the other person

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.080 align:middle line:90%
is totally wrong?

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And so it begins individually.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, from the
individual level,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:90%
it goes to the family level.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:84%
From family level, it
goes to our neighborhood,

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:84%
moves to our community,
moves to our city,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:90%
our state, our nations.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So that ultimately
there's a vibration

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:90%
where dialogue can take place.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
If you take individuals that
are in conflict-- whether it's

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Middle East, whether it's
Congo, wherever it was,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.450 align:middle line:84%
the devastation that occurred
in Rwanda few years ago.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:84%
--and you put people on
so-called either sides

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in a circle, and
you let one side

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:84%
listen to the inner
circle, talk about how

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:84%
they've been abused
and victimized

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and the people they've lost
and the deaths, this group

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:84%
would resonate and
start to have compassion

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.490 align:middle line:84%
about hearing their stories,
if they would listen.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Then, you put this
group on the other side

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.934 align:middle line:90%
and have them listen.

00:44:31.934 --> 00:44:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, they would
start to have compassion.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:10%
They would start to walk in,
as our Native American brothers

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:10%
say, they would walk a mile in
the other person's moccasins.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.759 align:middle line:10%
And when you're in tight
conflict, you don't do that.

00:44:43.759 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you look at the
things around the world, even

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.440 align:middle line:10%
the Middle East,
there are people

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:10%
on the ground that
are very peacekeeping,

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:10%
peace-loving beings.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.240 align:middle line:90%
You won't see that in the news.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's true.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You see the staunch
conservative individuals

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that are in leadership,
basically maintaining

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:05.610 align:middle line:90%
their particular point of view.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the individuals
that are on the ground,

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.790 align:middle line:84%
working with each other,
building community, providing

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:17.480 align:middle line:84%
the context for the unfoldment
of a way to work through this.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, as in
any cases such as this,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.449 align:middle line:84%
there are forces that like
to keep people separated.

00:45:24.449 --> 00:45:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you know of
those organizations?

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Are you part of them?

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Have you spoken to them?

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a
few of them but--

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: At sometime,
some of the individuals who

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.861 align:middle line:84%
have these really wonderful
schools have come to Agape,

00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and we've hosted them.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some of
them on my radio program.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.015 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about the
wonderful gatherings

00:45:41.015 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and the powerful
celebrations that occur.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.572 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The stuff we don't see.

00:45:44.572 --> 00:45:46.196 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That
should be on the news.

00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That should
be on the news every week.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.880 align:middle line:84%
This celebration occurred
right in the middle of Israel.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
This celebration occurred right
in the middle of Palestine.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.909 align:middle line:90%
And these people got together.

00:45:55.909 --> 00:45:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
people they healed.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
forgiveness that took place.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that was
focused on more,

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.730 align:middle line:84%
then the hate and unforgiveness
would be magnified.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If there was a news
program called,

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.250 align:middle line:84%
"The Greatest Way
to Self-healing

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.025 align:middle line:90%
Is to Help Others."

00:46:13.025 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then see what it
created, is created from that.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It's-- absolutely we have--

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You
create possibilities

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:middle line:84%
where there seems to be no way,
where things are intractable,

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way this
is going to change.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:84%
When we start to see the
field the possibilities then,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.250 align:middle line:84%
out of nothing
something happens.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's every great
invention, every great work

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.980 align:middle line:84%
of art, every great
song has come out

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:90%
of nothing, out of no thing.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So every great social movement
has come from an idea.

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:46.495 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:46:46.495 --> 00:46:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have the
perspective of seeing

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
social movements

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of different
organizations

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.920 align:middle line:90%
out there doing the good work.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.886 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever see
in the future all

00:46:54.886 --> 00:46:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of those organizations
coming together?

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Or are they already on a
different plane really?

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.394 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, I think
that's the next stage.

00:47:02.394 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The next stage of
our evolution is

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:09.410 align:middle line:84%
collaboration and
evolutionary alignments.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.844 align:middle line:84%
So that the organizations
that are strong

00:47:11.844 --> 00:47:13.260 align:middle line:84%
in and of themselves--
because you

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:84%
have to be strong in
and of yourself first

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate
with other strong.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
next evolutionary arc.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So individuals that are
about peacemaking instead

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of seeing each
other as competitors

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.700 align:middle line:84%
for nonprofit
dollars, they start

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate more on
the major issues of life.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Or those who are
serving the homeless.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Instead of seeing each
other as competitors

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.430 align:middle line:84%
for nonprofit dollars, they
start to work closer together.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And so spiritual organizations,
instead of seeing competitors

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.306 align:middle line:84%
for followers and things
of that particular nature,

00:47:47.306 --> 00:47:49.680 align:middle line:84%
they see themselves coming
together and working together.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:84%
You see this a lot with
different conferences now.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.088 align:middle line:84%
Where you have all
the spiritual teachers

00:47:53.088 --> 00:47:57.099 align:middle line:84%
in one room celebrating each
other and cross-pollination.

00:47:57.099 --> 00:47:59.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just as we saw
the mergers in the 80s,

00:47:59.015 --> 00:48:01.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe we'll see the mergers
of the nonprofits now to start

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
to grow and make themselves
bigger and have a bigger--

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And not like cancer where
it just becomes amorphous.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But everyone maintaining
their identity

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:84%
but supporting and
loving each other

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and celebrating each
other and positively

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.527 align:middle line:90%
gossiping about each other.

00:48:15.527 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A supporting each other.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of the
film, the DVD that's

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.480 align:middle line:90%
also available on Gaiam TV.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.610 align:middle line:90%
"Spiritual Liberation."

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.710 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Just
think about this.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:84%
That, what if you
becoming awake?

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:90%
What if you become involved?

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What if you, what if the world
depended upon you waking up?

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And I say, it does.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Agape.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a Greek word that
means unconditional love.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. described agape

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:84%
as the love of God operating
in the human heart.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.611 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we're here
to wake up to our true nature

00:48:56.611 --> 00:48:57.110 align:middle line:90%
in being.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, participate fully in
the society in which we live.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.670 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for over 21 years,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and it feels as though that
we're just getting started.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:10%
By the title, you're
aware that the book

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.530 align:middle line:10%
is about spiritual liberation.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:10%
Not religiosity but liberation.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about unlocking the
gifts and the beauty,

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence, the
capacity within us,

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:23.330 align:middle line:84%
along with spiritual
practices, that

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:26.920 align:middle line:84%
set us free to become
more ourselves.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.377 align:middle line:84%
There is an
evolutionary impulsive

00:49:28.377 --> 00:49:29.460 align:middle line:90%
that governs the universe.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Some call it God.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Some call it life itself.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We're at a stage
of our unfoldment

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:84%
where we can consciously
practice, consciously

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
participate in
our own evolution,

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in our own unfoldment.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we wake up,
we can be individuals

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.930 align:middle line:84%
who are pulling society further
so that your awakening not

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:51.290 align:middle line:84%
only affects you and your
family and your associations,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but your awakening
affects the entire planet.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When people ask, how do
I practice my belief?

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I have to, first of
all, say, your belief

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.930 align:middle line:84%
leads you to a
level of practice.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're
connected to life.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, I meditate every day.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:90%
I pray every day.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.920 align:middle line:84%
That prayer allows me to have
an insight and a revelation

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper dimension
of my own being.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Which then does what?

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Allows me to be more creative
and to be of greater service.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.770 align:middle line:10%
So belief becomes insight,
becomes creativity,

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:26.552 align:middle line:10%
becomes service.

Somebody--

00:51:01.834 --> 00:51:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: I went to my call
in therapist the other day.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted put me on
because they had just been

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.580 align:middle line:84%
at Agape the day before, and
they wanted to put it on.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.525 align:middle line:90%
Don't put in on while I'm here.

00:51:11.525 --> 00:51:14.027 align:middle line:84%
I need my body, I need my
body to rest for a moment.

00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:15.860 align:middle line:84%
If that comes on, I'm
going to be activated.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It's going to--

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually, let's
talk about your health.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.849 align:middle line:84%
You have taken your health
to a whole other level.

00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
many demands put

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:90%
on you from all you're creating.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.420 align:middle line:90%
So you-- I say a whole movie.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Juicing in the morning.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:90%
You-- what is your lifestyle?

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wake up.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I do my yoga.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I go to the gym.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I come back I. Do my green
drink for the family.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I do my meditation in
between there as well.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then, it's 7:00 AM.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Well, I'm
at the gym by 7:00.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.866 align:middle line:90%
And then, I'm at the office.

00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's a
time during the day

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.640 align:middle line:90%
for meditation and prayer.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening, I do
my second round of yoga.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that time
held for everyone.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:01.624 align:middle line:90%
Is it like a--

00:52:01.624 --> 00:52:03.915 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It is a time for
the community to meditate,

00:52:03.915 --> 00:52:06.150 align:middle line:84%
but there's a time on my
calendar for me to meditate.

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just put into my schedule.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:84%
If you don't write it
down, then, your demands

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in your schedule and your to do
lists are going to overrun it.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.085 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to say, well,
I've got to have this meeting,

00:52:19.085 --> 00:52:19.960 align:middle line:90%
and I got to do this.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:90%
I got to get this done.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.330 align:middle line:90%
You won't stop.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The mind
chatter will go then.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:23.358 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah.

00:52:23.358 --> 00:52:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I've said-- a couple of
months ago, I said, to Agape,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I did a talk on SYBD which means
sit your butt down and just

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:39.756 align:middle line:84%
stop during the day and sit your
butt down and have that moment.

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about
the fact that we all

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.552 align:middle line:84%
have a social contract
with each other.

00:52:43.552 --> 00:52:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is, just as you
have a social contract

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to shower and to
brush your teeth

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and be clean before you go
out and meet the public,

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.520 align:middle line:84%
you have a social contract
to connect with the divine

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.410 align:middle line:84%
before you walk out of your
house or people won't meet you.

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:84%
They're going to meet
your unresolved issues.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.320 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
meet your fears.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.205 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
meet your doubts.

00:52:59.205 --> 00:53:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
meet your anxieties.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:84%
They're going to meet your
undigested issues that you've

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:06.620 align:middle line:84%
had with your friends or
family and associates.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And you end up spewing
things out at the wrong time.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to sit your
butt down so that people

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.520 align:middle line:84%
get to meet you and
not your issues.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's a social contract
that those on the path, I'm

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.924 align:middle line:84%
inviting people to
raise their level up

00:53:20.924 --> 00:53:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to think not just
about themselves

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.170 align:middle line:84%
selfishly to pray and
meditate but to say,

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to have
to meet people today.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Do I want them to
meet the real me,

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:32.820 align:middle line:84%
or do I want them to meet the
anxiousness and the fear that

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:90%
may have gotten lodged in there?

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then, you do that
as a refresher during the day

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.610 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:38.484 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Oh, yeah.

00:53:38.484 --> 00:53:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't call it a refresher, but
it is the pause that refreshes.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, because you
meets different energies

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
during the day and different
things will light you up and so

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
great idea, yeah,

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.740 align:middle line:84%
to have that moment because
I'll get knocked off

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.057 align:middle line:90%
my course by one or two things.

00:53:54.057 --> 00:53:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: The world
this is spinning fast.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And the world of phenomena
is always changing.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able to go
that still place where you

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.112 align:middle line:84%
touch the changeless
so that that--

00:54:05.112 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The changeless?

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.195 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: The changeless.

00:54:07.195 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The presence of God and
of love is changeless.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.660 align:middle line:90%
It's timeless.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:90%
It's dimensionless.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.900 align:middle line:90%
It's now.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
An all change takes
place within it.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's infinite
and always unfolding,

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.620 align:middle line:84%
so you have to go to
where the changeless is.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.402 align:middle line:84%
So that when changes happen,
they don't knock you off.

00:54:23.402 --> 00:54:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when things
don't go the way that they're

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:84%
supposed to and what not,
then you go back to that place

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.410 align:middle line:90%
where everything is divine.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's like
there's an old Zen statement

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that I have in my book, "40
Day Mine Fast Soul Feast"

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can't prevent the birds
from flying around your head.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But you can prevent them from
making a nest in your hair.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.875 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't prevent
all of the negativity

00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and the negative thoughts
and the negative thinking

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.799 align:middle line:84%
and gossip and all this
stuff going on in the world.

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Around you.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.006 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: But
you can prevent it

00:54:54.006 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
from landing in your awareness
if you sit your butt down.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautifully said.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I asked Michael if he would
do just a few moments of us,

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to rise us up, to
bring it to this place

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.320 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual unfoldment,
of spiritual liberation.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And he agreed to just,
for a few minutes,

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:17.059 align:middle line:84%
do a little bit of what
happens at Agape with us here.

00:55:17.059 --> 00:55:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: You mean in prayer.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.268 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, in prayer for you.

00:55:21.268 --> 00:55:22.330 align:middle line:90%
For you listening.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.160 align:middle line:84%
You get a moment to
experience this joy.

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Those of
you tuning in, we just

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.234 align:middle line:90%
turn within in this moment.

00:55:31.234 --> 00:55:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And with the full
awareness that there's

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:36.244 align:middle line:84%
no separation between us and
the great God of the universe,

00:55:36.244 --> 00:55:38.410 align:middle line:84%
the great power, the great
presence, the great love,

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the great intelligence that
is everywhere in its fullness.

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:45.610 align:middle line:84%
With a full awareness
that our life

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.380 align:middle line:84%
is an emanation of the
only life that there is.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I know, as I am connected with
this divine life right now,

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that the very word that
I'm speaking, is its law.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It not tarry with yesterday.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It does not resist anything.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It only knows its
own fulfillment.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I speak this word now for
each and every individual that

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:10.050 align:middle line:84%
is watching this program,
knowing that where they are,

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.515 align:middle line:90%
the fullness of life is.

00:56:11.515 --> 00:56:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And this divine
life is so coursing

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:90%
through their spiritual veins.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The divine and compelling
right action, divine wisdom,

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:84%
guidance, and direction,
unfolding enthusiasm

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and abundance is now
the order of their day.

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And anything whatsoever that
would hinder, block, delay,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.260 align:middle line:84%
or deny this is now dissolved
into the no-thing-ness

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.530 align:middle line:84%
from which it has come,
never to exist again.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And we are free.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what is being
set in motion right now.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Something wonderful
is happening.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And we are now available to more
good than we can even imagine.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And our personal
law is now changing.

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And I give thanks for it.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.210 align:middle line:90%
It is so.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes it is.

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that timelessness,
that space, that freedom,

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:14.870 align:middle line:90%
that is.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:15.784 align:middle line:90%
Thank you--

00:57:15.784 --> 00:57:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Thank you.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.325 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --for giving
us the opportunity

00:57:18.325 --> 00:57:23.410 align:middle line:84%
