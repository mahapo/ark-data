00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching has a
certain sound, a note,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
a deep tone within us that is
attached to a certain frequency

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.164 align:middle line:90%
that establishes our voice.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, according
to my guest today,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Stewart Pearce-- he is a
sound healer and the founder

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Alchemy of Voice.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
He says that we
slowly stop feeling

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that organic voice within us and
we become disconnected from it.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.332 align:middle line:84%
And that moves us
towards disharmony.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, Stewart is
joining us to talk

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
about how to reconnect
with our true voice sound.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART PEARCE: Hi.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.433 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hello.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have
such a rich history,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
such an incredible
story of your childhood.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
where you were raised

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and how you grew up
and your experiences

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
as a child that'll lead us
to this whole conversation

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%
about our voice.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Where did you grow up?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Wow.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, by default, my
parents were royal servants,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and so I was brought up
in the royal household--

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You lived there?

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --in London.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.281 align:middle line:84%
So my dad worked for
the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
He was the equi for
the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And that meant that
we were in close

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:90%
proximity to the royal family.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.675 align:middle line:84%
So I think for the first few
years I was living in St.

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
James's palace and then they
were given a house in St.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
James's.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So they were in proxy,
or in close proximity.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did they
do for the royal palace?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.048 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, Dad
was like a sort of PA

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
to the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And therefore responsible
for all the protocol

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and the uniforms and which--
because there were something

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
like 50 different uniforms
from different regiments

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
or battalions, or
I can't remember.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he passed
many, many years ago.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But what was wonderful for
me was that I was brought up

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in the beauty and the glory of
what that entire institution

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
was about, and yet
at the same time

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
was actually able-- privy to
see that they are human beings,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and therefore there is an
ordinary side about it.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I had some very remarkable
encounters as a child.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Such as?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: For example,
I often tell this story

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:90%
because I love it.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The stationery in
Buckingham Palace

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
was of this particular--
the paper was

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
thickness, which

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
for a child of six, seven,
eight years of age making paper

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
airplanes was
absolutely amazing.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But you have these
huge galleries

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:90%
that have no thermals.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:90%
They have no drafts whatsoever.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So of course this
extraordinary stationery

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
would just go on and
on and on and on.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I do remember one day,
unbeknownst to my father,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
there I was playing with
this paper airplane.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And this voice said,
what are you doing?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And here was Her
Majesty, the Queen.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I must have been
about six or seven.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And she was extraordinary.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
She took me into her
private sitting room.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.815 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of
the footmen went off

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and got some hot orange
juice or something like that.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there sipping,
having a conversation

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
with Her Majesty, the Queen,
many, many, many, many, many

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How old were you?

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.744 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, I
was six or seven.

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you remember at
all, just the experience?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, what
I remember-- actually,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
what I really
remember was the awe

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that I felt, because
awe and majesty

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and grandeur, the delight and
the joy of those experiences,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
has always been something
that my life has taken me to,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
or if you like, that I've
unconsciously sort out.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Which I guess is to do with
why my destiny has led me,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
or I have been led,
to serve great people.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have in such
an extraordinary way.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you were raised and
growing up in the palace,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
what was your schooling like,
or were there other children

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: No, it
was very isolated.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Very, very, lonely.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And also the area
where these buildings

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
are situated in the
center of London

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a
non-residential area.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.385 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this very
isolated or alienated quality

00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:90%
of feeling.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
was bathing in the richness

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:90%
and the grandeur.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course at
that time I was still

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
really in connection with the
multi-dimensional universe.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:90%
That was the key thing.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you know that?

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, because I saw
a spirit, because I saw angels,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
because I saw
elementals, because I

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.774 align:middle line:84%
saw these extraordinary
things, these phenomenon.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you tell anyone?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.142 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, of course.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.945 align:middle line:90%
I thought everybody saw them.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I soon discovered
that was not so.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And although I had an immensely
loving mother who was richly

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
supportive and always
very understanding,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
even though she
didn't say, she was

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
aware of the possibility
of the preternatural,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.594 align:middle line:84%
the supernatural world--
largely as a result of the fact

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.385 align:middle line:84%
that she was brought
up in the countryside.

00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:59.315 align:middle line:90%
She was brought up in Norfolk.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.257 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather--
whose second name

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I carry, his name was
John-- was a Norfolk farmer.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:90%
He saw spirits.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
He whispered horses.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
He showed me fairy
rings as a child

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
because he believed that
he worked in co-creation

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
with nature, these
extraordinary awarenesses

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're now
acutely developing

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
as we see the need for
eco-sustainability, of how

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
we can actually live in
co-creation with nature.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So he would actually
literally speak

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.065 align:middle line:84%
to-- because he was an animal
farmer, not a pastoral farmer--

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
he would speak to the
vegetables or speak to the corn.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:90%
And it would grow.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said he
showed you fairy rings?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
What were those?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.024 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Where
the fairies danced.

00:05:44.024 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So at 5 o'clock
in the morning, he

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
would wake me-- shh--
put me on his shoulder,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and carry me off into the
fields as a very young being,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:90%
because he knew I saw.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
He knew I had a
sensitivity that was acute.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a problem
within the family,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
because I found it very
difficult to align myself

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
with academic or with
basic elementary subjects

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:90%
such as math or reading.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I could not read.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.514 align:middle line:84%
I could not read
before the age of 15.

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was largely
to do with the fact

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that now we know that
I was synesthetic.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had this crossover
of the senses,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:90%
which means that I saw sound.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I heard but also saw sound.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of dealing
with written literature,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
the word on the printed page,
the printed word on the page,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:90%
became a ch-ch-ch-ch.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I could not read.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Much later, around 11
or 12 in a church choir,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:90%
I learned to read singing.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I learned to read through the
wave consciousness, do you see?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I needed not
the staccato nature of "this

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
is a cat," which is how
a young child would read,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:90%
but "this is a cat."

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I needed a wave of--
(SINGING) this is a cat.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I needed the wave of
the legato dynamic

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of what it was to sing,
what it was to chant,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
what it was to use sound
through the breath wave,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and as a result of that found
the middle of my being, which

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:84%
enabled the static to
become much quieter.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
able to download

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
the substance of,
well, I'm seeing sound,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but actually I'm
also seeing the word.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So reading
music was easy for you?

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Not notes, but the
words to a song?

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah,
because after all,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
if you look at Handel's
Messiah or something,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the note is a
landscape reading very, very

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
basically-- not moving into
the complexity of musicianship

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
but just for a young boy reading
and following the landscape.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And it has a waving pattern
because the pitch frequencies

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the notes move in
a certain direction.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was cascading
along on this landscape.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But because I was singing, I was
in the breath wave, do you see?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And then the
words were underneath.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So initially, I was simply aping
what the other boys were doing,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:90%
parroting what they were doing.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But then these
words that I knew,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the words that we all
know from the songs

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that we sang as children, or
maybe carols at Christmas,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
"Away in the Manger," we
automatically go back there.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a muscle memory
that takes us there.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So I became very aware
of, ah, this word

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:90%
is connected with this symbol.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly the static ceased.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
wave of the energy,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you see-- that all
energy travels in waves.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now
we're able to see it

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
on a computer, where you could
see the sound frequencies.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what you see?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yes, yes.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.796 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what you see.

00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wanted to
go back to the fairies,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
the fairy circles in
the forest, because I

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:84%
was on that-- I was going
with you to the forest.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Did you see colors?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you could
see where in long grass,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in a copse of trees where
the fairies would dance.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So you could see, as it
were, not their footprints

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
because I don't believe
that they have footprints.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But you could actually
see literally the energy

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:90%
of where they had danced.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
There would be an iridescence,
an oscillating degree of force.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And often the trace elements
of their element presence

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
would be there.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we would
arrive when they

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
were getting to the
end of their dance,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and I would actually
literally see--

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure lots of our
viewers and you and I have

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
seen pinpricks of light
suddenly with, what was that?

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.627 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or even
smoke rising off of--

00:09:31.627 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Or smoke rising.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Steam, rising
up off of the-- yeah,

00:09:35.363 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:90%
that makes perfect sense.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I caught one of those
on video the other day.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So now how did you then
go from this and being

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
raised in the palace to being
into your next phase in life,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
which was the Shakespeare's
Globe Theatre?

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
That's quite an
extraordinary leap.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
How did you get from there to
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.872 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, learning,
as we've established,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:90%
was rather difficult for me.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But all the way
through this, people

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
said, you have something
about your voice.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about your voice.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a quality, resonance,
a tone, a timbre-- something

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:90%
unusual about your voice.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell
stories, it feels

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
as though-- I heard
this word, magnetic,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that people are drawn into
the quality of the story.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
detail within the story.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the resonance that
you use to tell the story.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, wow.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:40.956 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't do this-- meaning
math or academia per se.

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I was told constantly that I
was nothing and would always

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:90%
be nothing.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Please don't get
any violins out.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:90%
It's just that's what happened.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Obviously you see somebody that
doesn't believe that today.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.537 align:middle line:84%
I always believed
that I was some thing,

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:55.745 align:middle line:84%
but of course I was very
impacted by the emotionality

00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
of what that was all about,
the caregivers and caretakers

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
that as a child one respects.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Obviously that's very
impactful-- which meant

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that I was immensely insecure.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.002 align:middle line:84%
However there was still this
degree of people saying,

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
there's something
about your voice.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.675 align:middle line:90%
You ought to become an actor.

00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
I thought, gosh, absolutely.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in high school,
of course the first thing I did

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:90%
was to get into school plays.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And hey, people were giving
me more and more approbation.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.019 align:middle line:84%
So of course I announced
that big question of,

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:84%
so what do you want to
do when you grow up?

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Sunday
lunch with your folks.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, I want to be an actor.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
My father was totally,
against that and said, well,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
else you want to do.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.261 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you
know, I'd love to teach,

00:11:38.261 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
because there is a teacher
within me, evidently.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, the history
of my career shows that.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
I found that there

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
was a school, a
college which is part

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
of the University of London,
where I could actually

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
train as an actor teacher,
which is exactly what I did.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And then once I gained
the qualification

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
in graduating from
high school, I

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
went straight into the
industry as an actor

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and really through
the '70s worked

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
as an actor, which brought
me indeed to this great land.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And to the US.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And going through as an
actor at the Globe Theatre

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.534 align:middle line:90%
is quite a dream.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I wasn't
at the Globe Theatre.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
Shakespeare Globe Theatre

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:90%
was actually created much later.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
That was 20 years later.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
This was just me
working as an actor.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there were
54 repertory theatres alive

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in the United Kingdom.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, as a result
of Thatcherism and government

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
cutbacks, there are
only two at the moment.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But then, there was a
huge repertory theatre,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
so I got lost in learning the
craft of the actor and had

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary time
learning what it was.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, there
was an experience

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that happened where
your brother gave you

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
a phone call that changed the
trajectory of all of this.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Could you share that?

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
gets us to the voice.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yes, it brings us
to myself as a voice coach

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and also developing that that
I switched off from as a child,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
because obviously with the
educative process being

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
challenging, I had spoken
about what I was seeing.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was not aligned
with or agreed to,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.942 align:middle line:90%
or I was told simply shut up.

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're talking about.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:90%
So I switched off my psyche.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As many of us do.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But then much
later-- quite rightly.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And then much later,
growing as an actor,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and being in this great
land and being in a number

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.725 align:middle line:84%
of Broadway shows, I had
acquired a great manager,

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
a great agent, and I'd been
to a very successful casting,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and I got a movie part.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, what I
was doing after living

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
for 18 months in New York City,
I was moving to Los Angeles,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.242 align:middle line:84%
because the film
was being made here.

00:13:54.242 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the telephone rang.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.741 align:middle line:84%
And it was my brother
saying, what are you doing?

00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm packing
to go to Los Angeles.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.986 align:middle line:84%
You need to know that
Mom's got terminal cancer,

00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and she has three
months to live.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So something very remarkable
happened in that moment.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as though the
wheel of fortune went clunk.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, but I have a movie.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately, in that
moment, I realized, yeah,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
but I need to go and honor
this extraordinary experience.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.414 align:middle line:84%
So I let that
opportunity go, which

00:14:20.414 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:84%
meant that 20th Century Fox
would possibly never employ me

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.131 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, my agent and manager
were very, very, very angry

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But I went back to
the United Kingdom

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
and nursed her for a year.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And then she died.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
She passed.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, that's
when I reconnected

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
with a very extraordinary
woman called Cicely Berry, who

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
had been the voice
director of the RSC

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.459 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years who called
me out of the blue and said,

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:90%
well, what are you doing?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So again, the wheel
of fortune went clunk.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
not doing anything.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I've just been being this.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.489 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh.

00:14:51.489 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.946 align:middle line:84%
There was a little bit of an
expletive in there somewhere,

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, I don't know.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So she said, well, why don't
you come and teach for me?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
You have intuitive
skills as a voice coach.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, that surprised me.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But as an actor, obviously
I'd been through the craft.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd worked with
her, which is how--

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was just
never phrased that way.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.626 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It was never
phrased that way.

00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:90%
But a huge door suddenly opened.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So there I was working,
training young actors.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the opportunity

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
of working with a lady
called Margaret Thatcher.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how did you
cross into that realm

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of work with Lady Diana
and Margaret Thatcher

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and so many different well-known
celebrities, I would say,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:90%
in your area?

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
How did you get into working
with every single one

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:90%
of those people?

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Through the
people that I met.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
It was always through
the oral tradition,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.915 align:middle line:84%
through the interconnectivity
of having conversations

00:15:51.915 --> 00:15:53.194 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would
you teach them?

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
How would you teach them
to really use their voice?

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And how did that
change in their career?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
How did that change the
way people looked at them?

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, if we deal
with Margaret, for example,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of her
career, as the prime minister,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
or as the leader of
the Conservative Party,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
she had a voice that was
very, very high-pitched,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that had a slightly
patronizing quality about it.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And her diction was
slightly over-precise.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody felt
that she was rather

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
dictatorial and condescending.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did
was to give her

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.762 align:middle line:84%
a sense of where her voice
literally sat within the body

00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
from a physiological
point of view.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I allowed her to feel that
her voice could have weight,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
could have gravitas,
by tuning her

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
into what I believe is
extraordinary about we

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
human beings, which is her
note that you were referring to

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
our conversation.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I introduced
her to her note.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
She went there
immediately, because she

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:84%
was a very remarkable woman with
an extraordinary intelligence

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and knew that this was
a great opportunity

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
to serve her country in the
way that she defined it.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the rest
is in history in terms

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:90%
of what she did with that role.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:84%
But at that stage,
she was really

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
responding to
every single degree

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
of what her might could be,
so she very easily went there.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.633 align:middle line:84%
It's found largely
through relaxation

00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and through the breath.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that how it's found?

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain--
I mean, for example,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:90%
someone like Princess Diana.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
She had a different type
of-- maybe a commoner

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
sound to her voice in
the very beginning.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
How did you change that to be
that of a princess-like tone?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.847 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:17:46.847 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well again,
we weren't necessarily

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in search of finding a sound
that was full of status.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
What we were engaged
in is finding

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
her sound that was not actually
a sound that was, as it were,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
received.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the sort of sound
that I need to make.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a sound that she knew was
organically real and authentic

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:90%
to herself.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you see, as a model,
what I was actually doing

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
is taking the core of the
actor's work, which is

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:90%
the truth of feeling statement.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
That's at the core of
a great actor's work,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.785 align:middle line:84%
that if they're true,
then we believe them.

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:90%
We say that they're authentic.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
If they're not true, then
whether we perceive it or not,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
objectively or
subjectively, what we do

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
is we either watch
it or we leave.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.931 align:middle line:84%
We leave the movie theater or we
leave-- if it's spoken theater,

00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
it's not believable.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.112 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because it
is not believable.

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We say that's
rubbish, or something.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's a way of
being able to tune us

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.151 align:middle line:90%
all into that vibration.

00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The simple definition of it
is the fact that most of us

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
are brought up to be cerebral
through the educative

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and the socialization process.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we
live in our head.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're
validated by that.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.055 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:56.055 --> 00:18:57.971 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And everything
is validated up here.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, on
this big land mass,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
this great nation,
what we tend to do

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
is also get slightly tight
in the back of the tongue,

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and so everything
becomes very nasal.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the energy is
very high, like this.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you can see the
whole of my body has changed.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:90%
My voice has changed.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I actually
start doing this,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
suddenly something
else starts happening.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.551 align:middle line:90%
I've shifted the frequency.

00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I've released the
back of my tongue.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:23.965 align:middle line:90%
The throat is open.

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:25.679 align:middle line:84%
The nasality has
disappeared hopefully.

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Although, you know, I've been
using my voice very extensively

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
over the last three days
of this wonderful expo here

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.234 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles, that my
voice is slightly tired.

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But you can still
hear the degree.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.441 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely.

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you did
that nasally sound,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
your lips got a lot more energy.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Your jaw had a lot more energy.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.991 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Uh-huh, and everything
goes there, like that.

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm shouting at you, right?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.815 align:middle line:90%
And then I can't hear you.

00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:46.565 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Exactly.

00:19:46.565 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And who wants to listen to that?

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that I call electrical

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.292 align:middle line:84%
rather than this I believe,
as we are sitting in our note,

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
having this wonderful
conversation,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:90%
is immensely magnetic.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So we are drawn into the
experience of the information

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
as currents of sound
glyph, sonic glyph,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:90%
on the wave of the breath.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
find who we truly are.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:90%
We find our note.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
We find the song of our soul.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
We find the might
and the harmony

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:20.529 align:middle line:84%
of what the experience is to
have the humanity that we have.

00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And are you able to talk
about Princess Diana at all,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
about how you helped her
grow into the princess?

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Grow into the
being that she became-- well,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
if we look at some of the
early documentaries of Diana,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:84%
we know that she was constantly
doing this with her head.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.315 align:middle line:90%
And her eyes would look down.

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And then she would look
up, and she was often

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
hiding behind her hair.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So here is an immensely
vulnerable person

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
who is feeling very
insecure and intimidated

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
about the public
exposure of her office.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was to
actually bring her into focus,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
not hiding but to bring her
being, so therefore the whole

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:90%
of her physiology into focus.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't hide her eyes.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
She was actually
able to be aligned

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
through the spinal
cord being aligned,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and therefore being
able to do this.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes are actually still
and not constantly blinking

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and looking slightly
anxious or hiding like this

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and looking out of
the corner of her eye.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the body becomes
focused in this way,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
as soon as the spine
becomes aligned,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:90%
it's much easier to breathe.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it's much
easier to breathe,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
we take more volume of breath.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we take
more volume of breath,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:90%
our bodies just love oxygen.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, we literally

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
relax into the
middle of our beings.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
particularly if you

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
have an individual
such as Diana,

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:84%
who is unbelievably sensitive
and awakened to her body,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
as we saw through
what we now know

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
is the latter
stages of life-- we

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
saw how there were many stories
about her going to the gym

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
once a day and working
out and swimming.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So she was very aware of
her body-- the sensations

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and the impulses of body
become much more comfortable

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and therefore more relaxed.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.540 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
that, we always drop

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of our
being, so we find our note.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you helped
her find her note.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So I helped
her find her note.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do this
for many of us, right?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We could learn right now
how to find our note,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's a process
of discovering

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that inner-- where
would someone start

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to look for that
inner-- and those

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are great stories
and examples of how

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:90%
to find that inner presence.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting with your inner
being, your wholeness, correct?

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, where it starts
is, why are we not living

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:90%
in the wholeness of our being?

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:90%
That's where it starts.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It starts in the
stress of our lives,

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
where we're constantly
giving our power away,

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
because we feel that we need
to be doing what they want us

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to do, which doesn't necessarily
meet the full equanimity of who

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.947 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:23:05.947 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
We feel that we need
to be doing that.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
we become stressed.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a result--
I mean, is this OK?

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.962 align:middle line:90%
Is this all right?

00:23:12.962 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've moved
away fundamentally

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:84%
from who I am, and I've
become the spoiled child

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
or I've become the
wounded child or I've

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:90%
become the defensive person.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I've become all of
those syndromes.

of the music artists

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
do such deep breathing exercises
and voice exercises before they

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%

I hope I've disturbed

because in this
moment of disturbance

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
feeling that there's

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of noise
going on in your being,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:90%
particularly in your head.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The frenzy of
doing, doing, doing.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And here, we're going to
take a moment, just to be.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we go into
this moment of being,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
we realized that deep
within our physical presence

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.606 align:middle line:90%
is one amazing note.

00:25:27.606 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting
that when we are born,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:90%
we take this great gulp of air?

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
breathe in Pranayama.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.736 align:middle line:90%
We breathe in the source.

00:25:56.736 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But then we need to do
something with that breath,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.824 align:middle line:84%
so the great roar of
life tumbles out of us.

00:26:01.824 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And then something
happens to us.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
As we grow, as we are educated,
as we are socialized, in short,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:84%
as we experience
life, it seems that we

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
stop feeling the organic
instinctual naturalness of what

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
it is to be within the
celebration of the joy,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of that note, of that power, of
that pure celebration of life.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The alchemy of voice
has two pillars.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The first pillar is
the notion of the fact

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that we each have a note,
that deep within us,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
within our physical,
within our geometric form,

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is a sound that is the sum
total, the iridescence, of what

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that being is-- physically,
emotionally, mentally,

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the first pillar.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The second pillar is
the notion that often we

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
do not live that
note, and so we can

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
bring in the alchemy
of healing to transform

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of not living
that note into the probability

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
of truly living it.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So that actually,
what happens is

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
that we move from the
dis-ease or disenchantment

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
or disillusionment, or
indeed the disharmony,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and we move into enchantment,
we move into harmony,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
we move into
orientation, we move

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
into an expression of our
personal power that is unique

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're dealing with a
building block of creation.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.964 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with a
sound that sits deep

00:27:37.964 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:90%
within our own beings.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
As we look into the
beauty of nature,

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
here we sit in this
exquisite orchard.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It is the beginning
of May, and we

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.830 align:middle line:84%
see the blessed vernal season is
in a blessed state of harmony.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It makes us feel good.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, all we're doing
in finding our note

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
is actually
reflecting the harmony

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of this exquisite natural
state within our central being.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
become healthy.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Therefore we become vital.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.225 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we find
our personal power,

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
our sovereignty, the
great "I am" presence.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.771 align:middle line:84%

never the same again.

So is it true that once you
find this voice inside of you,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:90%
you don't ever go back?

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.023 align:middle line:90%

00:28:34.023 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%

say yes, I'd love to.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're talking
about-- often if we're

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
very stressed, if we're used
to giving our power away,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:84%
if we're habituated into
professional woundology

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's very unconscious--
so we're constantly

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
giving our power away--
it's a new sensation.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we're used to doing
something which is habituated,

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
what we need to do is to find
a way of acquiring a new habit,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:90%
and that sometimes takes time.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a good
way to learn, though.

>>PEARCE: But if there's
an objective, which

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:84%

that I worked with,

finding her voice-- as

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:84%
how can an actor be
totally natural in a very

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:90%
unnatural situation?

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Because after all,
if you're standing

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
in front of 1,500 people
playing a very intimate scene

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some of your
clothes are missing, I mean,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that's slightly
unnatural, isn't it?

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Or as we know from film
set, we have two actors

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
who are playing a scene,
and what we see on screen

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.597 align:middle line:90%
are two actors playing a scene.

00:29:40.597 --> 00:29:42.055 align:middle line:84%
They've often just
met one another.

00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They see cameramen.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.069 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And they're
seeing four cameras,

00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:46.945 align:middle line:84%
and the continuity
people, and the producers,

00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So there are 50
people out there.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
How do you remain intimate.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And so through the
answer to the question

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is that if repetition
is the mother of skill--

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
so if we keep repeating
sensation that introduces

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:84%
something which is about
complete empowerment,

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
complete ease, a sense
of personal confidence,

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.809 align:middle line:84%
and a radiation of our own
personal power, it's a delight.

00:30:14.809 --> 00:30:15.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an absolute delight.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, what pops into my
consciousness is that people

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.526 align:middle line:84%
often say, well,
what's it going to feel

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:21.284 align:middle line:90%
like when I've found my note?

00:30:21.284 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a sensation.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It's an experience.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with the
ideas, but we're also

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
living the experiences
you and I speak because we

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:90%
know what our note is.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I often say, well, what was
it like when you fell in love?

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's a completely
encompassing feeling.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's chemicals that
release, and there's-- yes,

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you're saying,
it's the same experience.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.531 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: So we find our power.

00:30:43.531 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So now how does this
connect you to your work

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.510 align:middle line:84%
with the angels in
the angelic realm?

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And how did you come
to that experience?

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you said as a child,
you saw many different beings,

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:90%
but you were invalidated.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So that got programmed
out for a little while.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
How did you reconnect with
that in your experience?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, it
was fascinating,

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:90%
and it was so organic.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I started
working with people's voices,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
their inner being

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.239 align:middle line:84%
because we do not
live the quality

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:84%
of the fullness of our voice
because the inner being is

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:90%
ill at ease.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And so intuitively,
through an empathic state,

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I would begin to feel what
that person was experiencing.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.292 align:middle line:84%
And often, if it
were appropriate--

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and I would always
ask permission--

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I would say, by the
way, intuitively

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.454 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- people would say,
how did you know that?

00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go
a little bit further

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.270 align:middle line:90%
because I would see spirit.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I would see a dear departed
one here and I would say,

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, what
I'm being told here,

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:90%
your mother is standing there.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They would say, oh my god,
how did you know that?

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And I would receive names.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I would receive details
about family experiences.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.559 align:middle line:84%
And so there was no
way that I cognitively

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:90%
would have known this to.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:90%
So I'd really switch back on.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And for the seven years
from 1980 through to '87,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I also saw the conviction
of what this was all about.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I trained with mediums
in the United Kingdom,

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
because I was
fascinated by the fact

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly a window of
my consciousness was opened.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, incidentally,
became fascinated

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.110 align:middle line:84%
by the poetry of some of
the great writers, who

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.264 align:middle line:90%
were all supernatural.

00:32:32.264 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They were all preternatural.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, William Blake
was a great visionary,

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.100 align:middle line:90%
just as Shakespeare was.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
They were very
extraordinary artists

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
who had the ability to
define their faculty as being

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:90%
infinite.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So I gained a reputation
for being a clairvoyant.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.265 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing both things,
working as a voice coach

00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and also working
as a clairvoyant.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And then came about a
very remarkable happening,

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
which we now know as the
harmonic convergence, August

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:90%
15, 16, 17, 1987.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine owned
a crystal store in a town

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
called Glastonbury in
Somersetshire, which is

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.766 align:middle line:90%
the heart chakra of the world.

00:33:14.766 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he said,
look, you know, I

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:84%
need to have somebody
to read for me.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
You're really,
really good at this.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Would you come down?

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So I went down to
Glastonbury for the weekend.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And there I was reading
for umpteen people

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:90%
and felt exhausted.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So as all of my teachers have
said, when you feel exhausted,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:90%
meditate.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll plug
back into source,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and everything will be fine.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So I went and sat
on Glastonbury Tor,

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
which is this very
large hill, which is

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:90%
known as St. Michael's Mound.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And sitting there,
minding my own business,

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by lots of people,
I had the most extraordinary

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All by yourself, wow.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: With all these
people, I suddenly heard,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.500 align:middle line:84%
as I was meditating,
these immense sounds,

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:84%
these celestial harmonics
that came to me.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was so surprised,
I opened my eyes.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And in front of me were
these amazing orbs.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And I heard deep within
my consciousness,

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.670 align:middle line:84%
we are the angels
of Atlantis, and we

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
are going to provide
you with teaching

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
about a temple of sound
healing that you will create,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:90%
called the alchemy of voice.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
within 20 minutes,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.860 align:middle line:90%
I downloaded all of this stuff.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It sounds absurd talking about
it, but that's what happened.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What type of information
did you download at that time?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And was anybody else around you?

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, there were
thousands of people there.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's a busy area.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.735 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I mean, I turned to
the guy sitting on my right

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and said, are you
seeing what I'm seeing?

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
yeah, oh yeah, man.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that he was stoned,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:84%
so obviously he wasn't quite
seeing what I was seeing.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
It seemed that although
people's attention were drawn

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
to these very large
orbs-- I mean,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about orbs
that are 360 degrees.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
They weren't just simply
one-dimensional forms.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
They were these 12
different colors--

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that people's
attention were drawn,

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
but it seemed that they
weren't drawn necessarily

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to the intelligence that was
being defined through me,

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that I was somehow
being able to perceive.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So then, over a process
of the next few years,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
they would appear and reappear.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would begin to interpret
their teachings, which

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
are largely about
emotional intelligence,

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
because angels love
for the sake of love.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.177 align:middle line:84%
We human beings love for
the sake of being loved.

00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually,
there's a video here

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.277 align:middle line:84%
where you take us to
the area and show us

00:35:37.277 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
from your point of
view what happened.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
so you can get a visual.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.891 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:41.891 --> 00:36:04.968 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.968 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Here I was,
sitting, meditating,

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.390 align:middle line:84%
during this very unique
astrological configuration

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
which we know as the
harmonic convergence, where

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.930 align:middle line:84%
most of the world seemed to
have converged on Glastonbury,

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.426 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of it
being a very powerful Earth

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:21.332 align:middle line:90%
energy vortex.

00:36:21.332 --> 00:36:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And as I was meditating here, I
heard this extraordinary sound,

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't the sound
of nature that I hear now.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I heard this very high-pitched
harmonic overtone,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and a light seared
through my body,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:90%
right through my heart chakra.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And smarting, I opened my eyes.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.815 align:middle line:84%
And in front of me,
I saw here 12 orbs

00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that were ringing with their own
harmonic-- extraordinary orbs

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:84%
of light in the air,
who revealed to me

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.584 align:middle line:84%
that they were to be called
the angels of Atlantis.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.162 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about history, of course,

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
is that when we look into the
embodiment of angel energy,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
we always see these beautiful
human beings with wings.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet when we dive into,
as I've done-- diving

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
into the Christian mystics and
the Sufi mystics, that so many

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of these people, these
illustrious people who

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
lived hundreds of
years ago, taught

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:90%
that angels were orbs of light.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it fascinating
that today we're

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:84%
seeing more and more photographs
of elemental energies

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:84%
or angelic possibilities
as orbs of light

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:84%
through the insurgence
of digital photography?

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The angels of Atlantis for
me appear more and more

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.640 align:middle line:84%
over these last 24
years, as though they

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
are a bridge between
heaven and Earth,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
as though they are
the very arch that

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.991 align:middle line:84%
is the transept holding
the roof of this temple

00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:23.990 align:middle line:84%
of sound healing, known
as the alchemy of voice?

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
for me within this,

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:84%
as I saw these 12
orbs, is that they

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
asked if I would
bring to the fore

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:84%
through publishing an oracle-- a
very, very ancient oracle of 44

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:90%
cards.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And this oracle is an
instrument by which

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to
perceive, whenever we're

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:55.290 align:middle line:84%
feeling in a dilemma, whenever
we're feeling confused,

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:84%
whenever we're feeling
of our wits' end,

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that if we could reach out for
the oracle, the intelligence

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that pours through these
rather exquisite icons.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It actually enables us
to really get closer

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.935 align:middle line:84%
to the whole nature
of how we can

00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:90%
draw the angels into our lives.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Throughout the
years, that information

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that came to you on
the mountain that day,

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
was it just too much information
to assimilate at that time?

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Was it multi-dimensional
information

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:90%
that came in layers?

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Or did you get it all at once?

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It took a while, huh?

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Otherwise I
would have been fried.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with immense
beings of plasmic force.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:84%
These are extraordinary,
extraordinary beings,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.570 align:middle line:84%
who would appear as
orbs, would appear

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:90%
as vast pillars of light.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.540 align:middle line:90%
So over a period of time.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the difference
between the angelic presence

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that you experienced and
maybe that of a lost loved,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:84%
or a crossed over
loved one, or someone

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.900 align:middle line:90%
who actually had a body?

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference in the
frequency in that experience?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, in
the presence of angel,

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the energy always appears
to be of vast proportion,

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.589 align:middle line:84%
where we are dealing
not with human force.

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:18.964 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nothing
to do with human?

00:40:18.964 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So the
sensation of the way

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that we reckon this,
that we perceive this,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is of a completely different
order of experience.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking into a
home that we haven't lived

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in for many years which was
immediately highly significant,

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.157 align:middle line:84%
and we automatically are taken
back into our emotional memory,

00:40:41.157 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
even though the furniture
is still not there

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.073 align:middle line:84%
and people have lived
there, et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:45.073 --> 00:40:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk
into a cathedral

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
or into a stately palace or
into a vast sacred geometric

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.220 align:middle line:90%
proportion of a building.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a totally
different experience.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, when
I see spirit that

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.945 align:middle line:84%
has been-- for example,
working with spirit that

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
is caught in fourth
dimension and finding ways

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of being able to cut cord
so that spirit can move back

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.130 align:middle line:84%
into the light-- because
often these beings

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that we refer to as being ghosts
or spirits that keep coming

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.324 align:middle line:84%
back and haunt, so
to speak, they're

00:41:21.324 --> 00:41:22.990 align:middle line:84%
beings that don't
even know that they've

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:84%
passed, that the
trauma of their passing

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:84%
was so severe that
they're caught

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.380 align:middle line:90%
within the space-time continuum.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They often appear to
me as light bodies

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that are not defined
in the same way

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.990 align:middle line:84%
as the extraordinary exclusivity
of what I'm referring

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:48.785 align:middle line:84%
to in relation to these plasmic
transmissions of force that

00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:49.810 align:middle line:90%
are angelic.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the word that you
say-- the plasmic transmissions

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:90%
of force.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:90%
This is how you describe.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So we see the
pictures of the angels

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:84%
with the female body and
the wings and so forth.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.029 align:middle line:90%
Where did all that come from?

00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:03.403 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I believe that
they're holographic projections,

00:42:03.403 --> 00:42:04.069 align:middle line:90%
do you see.

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're
actually projections

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.120 align:middle line:84%
The definition I
am led to believe,

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:84%
both by the preternatural
assistance of the angels

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and that that I've been
taught by scholars,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason why we
see human beings with wings

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
is because the early
patriarchs decided

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a human being
with wings, that's an angel.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.240 align:middle line:84%
If you have a human
being over here,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a saint or patriarch--
so there's a definition.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this is so
resonant in our consciousness

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:84%
because after all,
we have always

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
seen angels in
stained glass windows

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.610 align:middle line:84%
or we have seen
angels in books, or we

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
have been taught that
angels are thus--

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, human beings with
wings-- through greeting

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:84%
cards at Christmas and
so on and so forth,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that actually we
intend them to be thus,

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:90%
which I think is beautiful.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So the light transmission
of the angelic force,

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the angelic
identity, as it were,

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that actually
they are individualized.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
are host membranes

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that as they download through
light into these three

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, we see them as
individualized capacities.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I mean
centuries ago--

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.930 align:middle line:84%
because these drawings
began in ancient texts

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of the same type of angelic
being with the wings.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
that that was what

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.116 align:middle line:84%
the human mind could
interpret at that time

00:43:29.116 --> 00:43:30.115 align:middle line:90%
of those beams of light?

00:43:30.115 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, because we
were taught to believe it,

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:90%
so it was conditioned.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was conditioned
through the patriarchy

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:37.524 align:middle line:84%
of established temple
or synagogue or church.

00:43:37.524 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Across
religions, though--

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.250 align:middle line:90%
many non-denominationally.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everywhere.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I mean,
there aren't human beings

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.246 align:middle line:90%
with wings in Hinduism.

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There aren't?

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No, not at all.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:50.961 align:middle line:84%
And very few Islamic
scholars believe that they're

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:90%
human beings with wings.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Although, Jibril, or
Gabriel, as we know

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.540 align:middle line:84%
brought the Koran to Mohammed,
may his name be praised.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So the angels,
six or seven years

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:84%
into their tutelage
of me, said, what

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
do you know about angels, which
sounds a little bit aggressive.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But it was a prompting
of, well, what

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
do you know about
angels, because all

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.185 align:middle line:84%
of the re-information
that I had was received.

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
they wanted me

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
to rethink the equation
of what is angelology?

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they led me to some
of the great libraries

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of the world, where I was able
to delve into mystical texts

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:90%
from way back, way back.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Hildegard
von Bingen, I mean

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Dionysius the Areopagite,
John of the Cross--

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.730 align:middle line:84%
the early Christian mystics,
the early Sufi mystics.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I read that they believe
that angels were orbs of life.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, Eben Alexander's
book, "Proof of Heaven,"

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.980 align:middle line:84%
which we have all
touched into, also

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:84%
says that angels appeared
as orbs of light.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.710 align:middle line:90%
So isn't that interesting?

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:84%
We get this bridge between that
that was ancient and medieval,

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
or pre-medieval indeed, and
now what we're seeing today,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and the manifestation of
orb photography, which

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:90%
is just extraordinary.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, do you have
to be in a certain state

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to feel this presence,
because it is so vast?

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Or does it come to you through
hits throughout the day?

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
How do the ages communicate
with you throughout your day?

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So there's a
central frequency in my being

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
over the years,

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
'87, and now we're 2015.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.260 align:middle line:90%
So how many years is that?

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:90%
28 years, whatever.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a central
frequency within my being

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned where I
can switch on or switch off.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.090 align:middle line:84%
If I'm stressed-- so
I try to not allow

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.950 align:middle line:84%
my being to be stressed, but
I'm human, like everybody else,

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and so of course
we get stressed.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But if I become stressed, the
frequency closes completely.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is to practice
what my teachers have given

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:84%
me, what I believe is really
sensible for all of us, which

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:84%
is that we find at some point
during our daily toil silent

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.080 align:middle line:84%
solitude and stillness, where
we use breath to really tune

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.635 align:middle line:84%
into the release of stress
hormones like adrenaline

00:46:08.635 --> 00:46:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and cortisol and
bring about serotonin

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and bring about the delight
of what we're here for,

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.910 align:middle line:84%
which is to feel
good, not to feel bad.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
automatically, the frequency

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:90%
aligns.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, of
course, my glory, my desire,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is to be in remarkable
Earth energy vortices,

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:90%
such as sacred sanctuaries.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I go to Egypt
a tremendous amount

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.644 align:middle line:84%
and take retreats, large
groups of people to examine.

00:46:34.644 --> 00:46:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it more intense,
the energy more intense?

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It's
just extraordinary.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like going to some
of the great vortices in Arizona

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
or in New Mexico, or
other parts of the US.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.339 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to Shasta.

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to Glastonbury.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
Avebury Henge, which

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
powerful Earth energy

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.930 align:middle line:90%
centers in the planet.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Around Avebury Henge,
many of the major crop

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.760 align:middle line:84%
circles take place,
because it's a way

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.240 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial
friends to come in.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a magnetic force.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That vortex,
that particular frequency

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.062 align:middle line:84%
there in the grids
and how it's aligned.

00:47:09.062 --> 00:47:09.770 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can call it in
in different areas,

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.287 align:middle line:84%
but when you go to those areas,
it's so much more available.

00:47:15.287 --> 00:47:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: It's very acute.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So now the communication
with the angels,

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.280 align:middle line:84%
you have here an explanation
of what some of these angels

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:84%
specifically have
come to their messages

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that they deliver to us,
the divine messages that

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.260 align:middle line:84%
come through us--
Gabriel and Haniel

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.877 align:middle line:90%
and various different angels.

00:47:32.877 --> 00:47:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're frequencies
to you, right?

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Mm-hmm.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you get the name?

00:47:36.635 --> 00:47:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Did the name align with the
frequency that you feel?

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, firstly
I saw the light.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.760 align:middle line:84%
To be accurate, firstly
I heard the sound

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and then saw the light.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me that sound
transforms and light informs.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then through these
pulsations of sound and light,

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:84%
an image would register in my
consciousness of the orb, which

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.100 align:middle line:84%
would then associate
with the intelligence

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:11.040 align:middle line:84%
on, as it were, almost as though
they were downloading a code.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear the
harmonic of the sound move

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.340 align:middle line:90%
into a sonic glyph, or name.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And then through the awareness
that I had of-- well,

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Michael has been with me
since I was six years of age.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Michael was identified
because I saw the orb,

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.880 align:middle line:84%
but we were standing
outside a building

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that my mother told me was
a church at the age of five

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:90%
or six.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a church.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And on the side of the church
was a wrought-iron statue

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.020 align:middle line:84%
of a being apparently
called Archangel Michael.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And this being, as it were,
looked at me and said,

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I will always be with you.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
remember experiencing.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And so Michael became
transposed into a reality

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:56.450 align:middle line:90%
that is this orb.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the qualities,
the archetypal qualities,

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of what the action
of this being is

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:84%
about on this level
of experience.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.810 align:middle line:84%
In other areas of
the cosmos, I daresay

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the definitions are
completely different,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:11.566 align:middle line:84%
because we're not the
only civilization living

00:49:11.566 --> 00:49:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in this cosmos, in this galaxy.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Jophiel, the same
action took place.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I would hear the sound
and then see the light

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and then feel the
downloading and hear

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.580 align:middle line:90%
the quality of the sound.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I would then use my left brain
to go to a library or a book.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.896 align:middle line:90%
It's Jophiel.

00:49:31.896 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would look-- I mean, there
are books called dictionary

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.550 align:middle line:84%
of angels that many of
my illustrious colleagues

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:84%
or predecessors have
brought through,

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.700 align:middle line:84%
because there is a huge wave
of angelology taking place

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:45.680 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Great way showers like Diana
Cooper and Doreen Virtue

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.740 align:middle line:84%
have brought us so
much information.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I would go to
either their literature

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and hear what they've
been saying about Jophiel.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Not that I would actually
allow that information

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to supersede what
I was experiencing,

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.474 align:middle line:84%
but if it was useful,
it would expand.

00:50:03.474 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then see
if it would match

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.700 align:middle line:90%
what you felt-- yes, exactly.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So you came up with some
of the wonderful messages

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:90%
that they have come to deliver.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And you put it into words.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.229 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take a
look at this here on video.

00:50:17.229 --> 00:50:18.895 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Gabriel,
the divine messenger,

00:50:18.895 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
is present in our lives
to inspire and balance us,

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:84%
creating harmony and the
pursuit of inner peace.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Hanael, the sacred
warrior, helps

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.810 align:middle line:84%
us to connect with our
inner strength and courage,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:40.290 align:middle line:84%
reminding us to believe in the
power of integrity and hope.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Jophiel, the holy
liberator, helps

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.860 align:middle line:84%
us to release all negative
feelings, showing us

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that when we let go
of the challenges,

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.050 align:middle line:84%
we achieve unlimited
love and joy.

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Metatron, the supernal
teacher, shows us

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:84%
how the merciful might of
our divine intelligence

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.030 align:middle line:84%
brings wisdom and the
wonder of miracles.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Michael, the cosmic
leader, enchants

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:84%
us to transmute our base
feelings into higher purposes.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we achieve
magical clarity concerning

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.360 align:middle line:90%
our leadership potential.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Raphael, the holy
healer, empathetically

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:20.520 align:middle line:84%
leads us to cleansing
and purification

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.200 align:middle line:84%
so that we feel the power over
the coursing through our veins.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Raziel, the keeper of
the divine mysteries,

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:32.290 align:middle line:84%
speaks to us through our
dreams and meditative retreats,

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.160 align:middle line:84%
bringing us always to
a position of harmony

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:90%
within our intuition.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Sandalphon is the sacred
guardian of the planet

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and of earthly evolution.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So this exquisite
angel guides us

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.545 align:middle line:84%
through planetary cycles
that transform us.

00:51:48.545 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Shamael is the divine
guide indicating

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.390 align:middle line:84%
how new beginnings
bring us to the changing

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.685 align:middle line:90%
wonder of our lives.

00:51:58.685 --> 00:52:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Uriel, the divine
companion, shows us

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.590 align:middle line:84%
how our consciousness
leads to abundant freedom

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:13.540 align:middle line:84%
through the development of
belief, faith, and trust.

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Zadkiel is the
divine comforter who

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:19.800 align:middle line:84%
holds us strongly in the
security of our spirituality,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.760 align:middle line:84%
particularly when life's
challenges are rich.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Zadkiel shows us that
love, joy, and gratitude

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.810 align:middle line:90%
allow abundance to flow.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Zaphkiel is the sacred
lover who initiates us

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:36.790 align:middle line:84%
through the great
compression of the source,

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.630 align:middle line:84%
leading us to untold
ecstasy concerning

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the wonder of surrendering
to the romance of life.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.065 align:middle line:84%
This oracle are like
the signature notes

00:52:51.065 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our bodies.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.240 align:middle line:90%
They're our own unique sound.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you like, this
oracle is the signature note

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:84%
in this particular form of
these 12 angels of Atlantis.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.780 align:middle line:84%
They're literally waiting
all the time for us

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to call upon them, whether
we wish them messages,

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.990 align:middle line:84%
whether we wish
guidance, whether we wish

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.070 align:middle line:84%
teaching, whether
we wish comfort,

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:90%
whether we wish to be inspired.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:18.760 align:middle line:84%
There they are through
these archetypal energies,

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.780 align:middle line:84%
waiting for us to
call upon them.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And by the usage of
this oracle, not only

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:84%
are we tuned into the
wonderment of these angels

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.800 align:middle line:84%
but we are also brought into the
symphony of our own signature

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.250 align:middle line:90%
note.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we find
our signature note,

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.750 align:middle line:84%
we find such joy, such
purity, and such power

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that all we wish to do is
to live out our sovereignty

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.476 align:middle line:90%
full of love and joy.

00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:47.267 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:53:47.267 --> 00:53:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you tell
us about Atlantis,

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:59.700 align:middle line:84%
about what information you've
received or that you know?

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.656 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Why these
beings, these 12 beings

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:84%
call themselves the
angels of Atlantis?

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: So two sections.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll get to Atlantis in a
moment, the second section.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, these
beings, I understand,

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:19.246 align:middle line:84%
are very ancient beings
in the intelligence

00:54:19.246 --> 00:54:23.370 align:middle line:84%
of this civilization,
planet Earth.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But in Kabbalah,
they're referred to

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:30.980 align:middle line:84%
as being the malakim,
which a Hebrew word,

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning the royal angels, that
overshadow the Melchizedek.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.100 align:middle line:90%
We hear Melchizedek as one.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm taught, they teach me, that
the Melchizedek-- Melchizedek,

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:49.290 align:middle line:84%
meaning the priest kings,
were these 12 archetypal

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.950 align:middle line:84%
or patriarchal
figures that today we

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.010 align:middle line:84%
refer to as being
the white brotherhood

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.840 align:middle line:90%
or the intergalactic council.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen
drawings, photos.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.111 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:54:59.111 --> 00:54:59.777 align:middle line:90%
Interpretations.

00:54:59.777 --> 00:55:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And then
we ask, well, why 12?

00:55:01.443 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:90%
What's this 12 thing?

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.712 align:middle line:84%
Because we know seven
as being crucial-- seven

00:55:05.712 --> 00:55:08.170 align:middle line:84%
days of the week, seven chakras,
seven notes in the octave,

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:10.420 align:middle line:84%
the seven deadly sins, the
seven wonders of the world.

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's big in the bible.

00:55:12.295 --> 00:55:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It seems
that we're waking up

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.870 align:middle line:84%
to the significance
of number as vibration

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that seven
is the planetary resonance

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.547 align:middle line:84%
frequency that is mutating
and changing at this time.

00:55:22.547 --> 00:55:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
what we're doing

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is we're waking up to the
fact that we are stardust,

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:31.545 align:middle line:84%
we are star beings, we are
spiritual beings in human form,

00:55:31.545 --> 00:55:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we're
beginning to awaken

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to universal resonant frequency,
which is what the number 12 is.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's, as it were,
a ring pass knot

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to
understand what

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the permutations of cosmology
is all about in relation

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to planetology, of
what is this thing

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.200 align:middle line:90%
that we're living on all about?

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.390 align:middle line:84%
This great Gaia--
what is it all about?

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they teach me that
it is an intergalactic or

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.830 align:middle line:84%
cosmological experiment
purely and simply

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.860 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
element of choice,

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
living for centuries

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.300 align:middle line:90%
a substance of duality.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
like, pain or pleasure?

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Guild or innocence?

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Imprisonment or freedom?

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that list goes
off into infinity.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.490 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that
thought creates reality,

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and feeling brings about the
actualization of that force.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:84%
We're learning this through
the law of attraction.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're beginning to
understand the substance of how

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.000 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness works--
that we're from the source

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and the source is an infinitely
unfolding creative possibility

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.370 align:middle line:84%
full of love and joy,
that we come here

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:40.091 align:middle line:84%
to optimize our creative
energy, full of love and joy.

00:56:40.091 --> 00:56:40.840 align:middle line:90%
So how's it going?

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's still
filled with duality.

00:56:46.129 --> 00:56:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And so we know we
oscillate between these two

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.434 align:middle line:84%
degrees, except
at the same time,

00:56:50.434 --> 00:56:52.350 align:middle line:84%
we know that those of
us who have been working

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:84%
on the simplicity of
what this is all about

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.779 align:middle line:84%
is that life is getting easier,
because we're becoming more

00:56:57.779 --> 00:56:59.570 align:middle line:84%
mature-- physically,
emotionally, mentally,

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually--
about no, the choice

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is that although
I'm feeling like,

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually now
going to move myself

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.110 align:middle line:84%
into the feeling of
a higher vibration,

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because then I'm in
touch with source.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So I give myself time to
alter the degree of energy

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:16.280 align:middle line:84%
within my body physically
and emotionally

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.305 align:middle line:90%
so that I feel better.

00:57:17.305 --> 00:57:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you feel that's
happening quicker now?

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh god, yes.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.335 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And especially now as
opposed to in the '80 when--

00:57:22.335 --> 00:57:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And you
know, if His Holiness,

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:26.230 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama were
here, he would say,

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:27.580 align:middle line:90%
happiness is a decision.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not a condition.

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So we decide.

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We consciously move--
so I'm feeling unhappy.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, what are you going to
do about it, wallow in that

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:90%
or shift?

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds
slightly irresponsible,

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.390 align:middle line:84%
because unhappiness
is a very real degree,

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and I have great
compassion for it.

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the same thing
can be said for disease.

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:48.340 align:middle line:90%
You could shift at any moment.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:90%
You could make that decision.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So much easier said
than done, but once

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.480 align:middle line:84%
you embody that,
then it becomes as

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.753 align:middle line:90%
easy as snapping your fingers.

00:57:56.753 --> 00:57:57.627 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:57:57.627 --> 00:58:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that we're
beings of infinite potential.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, that's when
Atlantis drops in, do you see?

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.974 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we've seen it
done on spontaneous healings

00:58:06.974 --> 00:58:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and people who have had
miraculous recoveries.

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's a shift.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a state.

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's tapping into a source.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And it happens faster and
faster and more and more

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.840 align:middle line:90%
frequently now.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And that makes sense-- of
everything that you've said,

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and I love that you agree
that this has intensified.

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So these types of
energies and frequencies

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:27.540 align:middle line:84%
are even more readily available
to us now more than ever.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You provide us a way of tapping
into that, and it is possible.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: It's not possible.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:34.752 align:middle line:90%
It's probable.

00:58:34.752 --> 00:58:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Probable.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.245 align:middle line:90%
OK, I like that even better.

00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're ceasing it being
as-- we're now really aligned

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.780 align:middle line:90%
with our infinite potential.

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And in my own
particular experience,

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:51.200 align:middle line:84%
the context of my
mother dying of cancer

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.020 align:middle line:84%
was an initiation into
the last 30-odd years

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of me working in the celebration
of the divine feminine

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.200 align:middle line:90%
in helping women through cancer.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that 85% of
those women who come to me

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.305 align:middle line:84%
say, I've just been
told by my oncologist

00:59:06.305 --> 00:59:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that I have terminal
cancer, that they actually

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:13.330 align:middle line:84%
revolutionize the stage of
the disease in their beings,

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and they move into
complete remission.

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 85%?

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: 85%.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It is a probability
without doubt.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there are
some of us who choose to pass.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's a karmic choice.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in, for
example, the extraordinary work

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of John of God, that he is this
immense supernatural healer

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:39.660 align:middle line:84%
that can heal but also allow
the karma to take place.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So we come to Atlantis,
and we recognize

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that these beings of light,
these 12 beings of light,

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.210 align:middle line:84%
known as the angels
of Atlantis, that they

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.790 align:middle line:84%
come with the intelligence
of the echo of Atlantis

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because when Atlantis
as a civilization

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.110 align:middle line:84%
took place on this planet,
the planet was living through,

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:00.100 align:middle line:84%
as it were, a period
of growth that

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.020 align:middle line:84%
was very similar to the
evolutionary strives that

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.105 align:middle line:84%
are taking place at
this time, but of course

01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:08.950 align:middle line:84%
it was different in terms of
the time aspect of the way

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that cosmology works within
this particular realm

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, or
indeed of the cosmos.

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Why Atlantis?

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Because Atlantis
was a civilization--

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:24.889 align:middle line:84%
it existed on so many
different levels,

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
because the beings that
lived there were actually

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:29.350 align:middle line:90%
vibrating a 12-helix DNA.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We're operating through
a double helix DNA,

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
so we have 64 codons of DNA,
but we're only living 20.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
we have 44 dormant.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge
gestational force that

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.190 align:middle line:90%
is taking place at this time.

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So they come with the imprint
of the Atlantian consciousness

01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to say, this is an opportunity.

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a portal of frequency
for you to all step forward

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.250 align:middle line:90%
through.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And what the remembrance of
Atlantis can provide you with

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is a template where a
replication can take place--

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
if you wish it.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there
are so many people who

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
are angel communicators now,
because they come closer

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
to that frequency
through a portal

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
or opening or a cosmic shift,
and that they're able to pull

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
closer into this dimension now.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're operating at 20.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They're operating at about
64, and slowly the gap

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.640 align:middle line:90%
is going to close.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Thank you so much.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I could go on.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
