00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:17.172 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.588 align:middle line:84%
and we are broadcasting
from the Conscious Life

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Expo in Los Angeles.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So it is true, we are
experiencing weather patterns

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that are breaking
records every single day.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
There's been a dramatic
increase in the number

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of devastating floods,
and frosts, and wildfires.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like that we're
hearing about new climate

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
extremes in the news
every single day.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how long are
we going to be shocked by this?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.307 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be the new norm.

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
we're talking about today

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:90%
with Gregg Braden.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
He's a geologist
and a scientist.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
He has a great new
book out addressing

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
this issue called The
Turning Point: Creating

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
a Resilience in a Time
of Extremes, which

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:90%
is what we need.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:90%
How do we create resilience?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.274 align:middle line:84%
Every single day there's
a breaking record.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: It is.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The best minds of
our time, Lisa,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
are telling us in
fact that we are

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.425 align:middle line:84%
living with a culling,
a time of extremes.

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:12.354 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is important
to say in a very real way.

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that extremes
are bad things or even

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:10%
good things for that matter.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:10%
It's means they're big things.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think our audience and
certainly relate to that.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Big stuff happening in the world
every time you turn around.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Of all of the big things
that are happening,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
they fall in a few categories.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Climate is certainly
one of those.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
The economy is
certainly one of those.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:10%
Energy, where our
energy comes from.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:10%
The move from oil into
new sources of energy

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:10%
and the effect it's
having on our economy.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
The price we pay for food.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And the way we get ourselves
from point A to point B.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
All these things and
more are creating

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
what is now being
called a new normal.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These are all survival
related issues though.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:90%
These cause death.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:90%
They famine.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:90%
They cause drought.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are--
it's not like we're

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.274 align:middle line:90%
talking about lofty politics.

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Not anymore.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, these are.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They're big things
in all of our lives.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.363 align:middle line:90%
And this is the key.

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We can no longer separate
the things from the big world

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
out there from what's happening
in our everyday lives.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:90%
There's a tendency to do that.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And there has been a
reluctance in the mainstream.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.482 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm so
honored to be here with you

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to share
this with our audience.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.273 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
reluctance, and some cases,

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
a flat out resistance
in the mainstream media

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to share the facts of
what this new normal is.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be very clear.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not about making anyone
wrong or making anyone right.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But the question I ask myself
all the time, Lisa, is this.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
time of extremes.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.534 align:middle line:84%
How can we deal
with the extremes

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
if we're not honest with
ourselves about the extremes?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And that comes
down to the facts.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's a tendency, even
for the mainstream public.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.255 align:middle line:84%
We're so busy in
our everyday lives.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:49.796 align:middle line:84%
Taking our kids to
school, and trying

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:90%
to put groceries on our table.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Going to work or
hoping to find work.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Who's got time to
think about this stuff?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But the key is,
it is by thinking

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
about these things that
helps us to navigate

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the extremes in our lives.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, the world
of the past no longer exists.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
A new normal is
emerging, and many people

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
are clinging to an idea of
what the old world looks like,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.052 align:middle line:84%
waiting for things
to get back to normal

00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
rather than embracing the
opportunities of right now.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
excited to talk to you.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.099 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Along with the
recession, people keep

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to compare
today's numbers

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.602 align:middle line:90%
to what was before 2008.

00:03:24.602 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
going to happen again.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The economy.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
compare the climate

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
to the way it was 10 years ago.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.426 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
as a geologist,

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:32.647 align:middle line:90%
it makes no sense to do that.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
some of the statistics

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:90%
from your book that you mention.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
From 2012 just alone, it was
the world's ninth warmest

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:90%
recorded year since 1850.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.995 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when we talk
about climate--

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
preface this by saying,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
as a geologist, when I began
hearing back in the 1970s about

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
climate change,
my first instinct

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
was to go to the Earth herself.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's let Earth tell her story.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not a politician.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
political capital to gain.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.954 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an academic with
a reputation of defend.

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I lost my reputation-- that
went out the window years ago,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
so I'm not worried about that.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, you didn't.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Or involved
with any corporations that

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.686 align:middle line:84%
have something to gain from
anything other than the truth.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think we owe
it to ourselves

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to honor ourselves
with the facts.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to climate,
we're being told a story.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a story that's
being perpetuated

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:90%
through mainstream media.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, the
data doesn't support

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
this story in its entirety.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
We are having climate
change, that's the point.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the climate is changing,
what does it mean in our lives?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we're being led
to think that by changing

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
some light bulbs and driving a
smaller car, that we're going

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the way the
climate was 10 years ago,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.792 align:middle line:84%
the facts simply don't
support that proposition.

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's an
old message as well.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.889 align:middle line:84%
And there are four--
may I just share?

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are
four big questions

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that I think we owe it
to ourselves to answer.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And the first question is, we're
being told that the greenhouse

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.127 align:middle line:84%
gases are the cause
first of the warming.

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we're not hearing
about warming so much anymore.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.835 align:middle line:84%
They just call it
climate change,

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
but the term "warming"
has dropped out.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That greenhouse gases
are the problem.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the ice cores
from Greenland and Antarctica,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.722 align:middle line:84%
for example, every year-- I
think most of our listeners

00:05:17.722 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with
this-- every year

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a new layer of ice
that captures information.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Little bubbles of air
in the atmosphere,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
dust particles, pollen
grains, tells us

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:90%
a lot about our history.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Antarctic cores we
now have the Vostok ice core

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that revealed 420,000
layers of ice-- that's

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
420,000 years of the
history of the Earth--

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
to compare to right now.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.557 align:middle line:84%
To see what normal
really is all about.

00:05:44.557 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things we can see

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
is that there are cycles, very
obvious cycles, 100,000 year

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
cycles.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
41,000 year cycles,
21,000 year, 5,000 year

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
nested cycles where we
can expect these variances

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in temperature.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And we happen to
be living in a time

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
where the data says we should be
living a warming and a change.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:90%
The question is how much.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And are the greenhouse
gases the cause?

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So through those
420,000 years there are spikes

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.237 align:middle line:84%
and different changes that
are visible in these cores.

00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Rhythmic spikes.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so we're in one
of those predicted spikes.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.077 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We are.

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it very clearly.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.946 align:middle line:84%
But there are four questions
that I think, as I mentioned,

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we owe it to
ourselves to answer.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And the first question is,
if the greenhouse gases are

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
causing this change,
you would expect

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to see in the past a rise in
those greenhouse gases first

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.644 align:middle line:84%
and then the rise
in the temperature

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:90%
spikes and the other things.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And what the data shows,
Lisa, is just the opposite.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It shows the
temperatures rise first.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.727 align:middle line:84%
And then that is followed by a
rise in the greenhouse gases.

00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
when the greenhouse gases

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
begin to rise, you can
see on the Vostok ice

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
cores the temperatures
actually drop.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
It leads to a cooling,
just the opposite

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:90%
of what we're being told.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why does that happen?

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Pressure?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What it says, it says
if the temperature's rising

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
first and the greenhouse
gases follow--

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a lag time
of 400 to 800 years--

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
it means the gasses cannot
be the cause of the warming.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not, we need
to get real about what is.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.035 align:middle line:84%
The second-- that's
the first question.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:90%
That's only the first question.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
The second question is with
regard to the warming itself.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.777 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
warming, new data--

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:90%
this is all peer reviewed.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't speculation,
or hypothesis, or theory.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.044 align:middle line:84%
New data is showing, for
the last 2000 years--

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
now this is important.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:90%
This isn't caveman times.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
This is within historic times.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.762 align:middle line:84%
The last 2,000 years, the
temperatures on the Earth

00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
have been much warmer
than they are right

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.509 align:middle line:90%
now, two to three times warmer.

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
pronounced was actually

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
called the Medieval
Warming Period, MWP,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
800 to 1100 common era,
somewhere right around in there

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
chart you're looking at.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.726 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
the temperatures

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
have been warmer without the
carbon dioxide, the greenhouse

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%
gases, to trigger the warming.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And the characteristic
of the warming

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is that it happens-- it's
intense, it happens quickly,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's what happens after
the warming that's the problem.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's the cooling that
follows the warming that

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.827 align:middle line:84%
is pronounced in the
northern hemisphere

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
where most of the land is,
where most of the people are,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and where most of
our food is grown.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.605 align:middle line:84%
So second question, why
do we have this warming

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
in the last 2,000 years without
the greenhouse gases causing

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
The third question
that we're looking at,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
why has the warming part of the
greenhouse warming fallen out?

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We haven't had significant
warming since 1997.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.003 align:middle line:84%
While the models tell
us-- if the models are

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:37.461 align:middle line:84%
correct-- the models
are telling us

00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:84%
it should be-- we should
keep warming and warming.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
And just the opposite
is happening.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And the last question is, why
are we now having more ice,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.799 align:middle line:84%
thicker ice, more
ice in Antarctica?

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because the
opposite was predicted.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Exactly
the opposite was.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the irony is that when the
Climate Assessment came out

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
this year telling us how bad
the warming was supposed to be,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the irony was that there was
a ship stuck in the ice that

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
is now forming in Antarctica.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And the ships that went
in to help save everybody,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that ship got stuck in
the ice because the ice

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
is so massive right now.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.789 align:middle line:90%
So these are four questions.

00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not about
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.454 align:middle line:84%
It's about being
honest with ourselves.

00:09:16.454 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're barking
up the wrong tree

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and if we're thinking
incorrectly about climate,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
how can we adapt to what the
changes really mean to us?

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And really honor
ourselves to do that?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have to
ask, do you believe

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that this weather-- the
prediction of course

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:90%
was not correct.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But is it being manipulated by
cloud seeding, or vaporization,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:90%
or anything?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The weather itself?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, I don't have
firsthand knowledge of that,

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Lisa.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist
what I can say is I

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:90%
can only speak to the facts.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think the truth is
we're in uncharted territory.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
In the modern world nobody's
ever seen this happen.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
whose reputations

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
are staked upon their story and
they're going to stick to it.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
There are climate models,
computerized climate models.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But here's the problem
with the models.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The models haven't
been right so far.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And as a computer scientist-- my
background is computer science,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But here's where
I get concerned.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Is that even when we plug in
the data for what has already

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
happened to correct
the models, they still

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
are not accurate about
telling us where we are now.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So the models are
so far-- there's

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
something missing in
the models, something

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that we are not incorporating
into these facts.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So the question is-- and I
just, I want to say this--

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
if the CO2 is not causing it and
the change is absolutely here,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's obvious the change
is here, what is causing it?

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
profound study that

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
was published by the
Proceedings of the National

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Sciences
in the year 2000.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
inconvenient chart.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
chart of the energy

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
from the sun reaching
the Earth over time.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And what it shows are peaks
and valleys of intensity.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The sun's energy is
not always the same

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
when it reaches the Earth.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is linked to the
tilt, the angle, the wobble,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and the orbit of our
planet in space in relation

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to the sun over long
periods of time.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So no one living today
remembers the last time

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%
we went through these things.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that the
statistics, the charts, they

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
show very, very clearly that
we are living a time when

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
this energy is spiking briefly.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a small
spike in the energy

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're receiving
from the sun.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And there is a growing number
of scientists and a growing

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
consensus that this is
probably driving the change.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is my concern.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Because historically, the
spike is intense, it's brief,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and it falls off quickly.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For how
long does it spike?

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It can
happen over decades,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:90%
which is where we are right now.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it falls off
quickly into-- I'm not

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
going to say an ice
age-- but into a cooling.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take much
of a cooling to impact us,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the way we live, our
opportunity to grow food,

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
when the rains come that we've
come to rely upon for our crops

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and for major
metropolitan cities.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
40% of the United States is
in a major drought right now,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the first time
we've ever seen this

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.995 align:middle line:84%
since they began keeping
weather records in 1888

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
was the first year National
Weather Service started

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:90%
keeping the records.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes and
there are no plans.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I heard this
morning on the news

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that there's only enough water
to sustain us for another year

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and half if there are
no rains that come.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And then it will be--

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.605 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And we've never
seen this before.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is why there
are people that

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
are accusing anyone who
questions the climate

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.307 align:middle line:90%
story as a climate denier.

00:12:36.307 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be
really clear, nothing

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
could be further from the truth.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We are in the middle
of a big change.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:90%
That's precisely the point.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said, we
owe it to ourselves

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to be honest about the facts
so that we can responsibly

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.109 align:middle line:84%
adapt to the new normal of
climate that in all likelihood

00:12:53.109 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle line:84%
is going to be with us the
remainder of our lifetime

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.524 align:middle line:84%
and probably through your
daughter's lifetime as well.

00:12:57.524 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So extremes
are the new norm.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.155 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a question
about what you just

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
said about 1997 being
the peak of heat.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.017 align:middle line:84%
So we're now a decade
or so after that.

00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that
we're heading into this.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm saying that
the warming hasn't continued

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:90%
the way the models predicted.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:84%
If you remember some of
the very frightening--

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the media really grabbed this
with amazing computer graphics

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and showed those very
frightening projections

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
of Manhattan 20 years from now
with tumbleweeds blowing down

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:84%
the scorched street
and cow bones laying

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the road.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And the sense that--
it was linear.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And the data simply
doesn't support it.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.395 align:middle line:84%
It's not showing
that it's linear.

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It means there's something
wrong with the model.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
honoring that and saying

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
there's something we don't know,
there are a lot of politics,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of money, a
lot of ego, a lot of habit,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:90%
all these things in the mix.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot of investment.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, in the mix.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.737 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the
extremes, it's interesting,

00:13:54.737 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
it's only extreme when you
compare it to something else.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.778 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, a lot
of the statistics do.

00:13:58.778 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
That we have record high
temperatures in the US with 197

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
all time highs and that there's
worldwide been 2 and 1/2

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
fold increase in the number
of devastating floods

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and an increasing amount of
North American tropical storms.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And a snow storm in
Syria, where the-- in Lebanon

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
where the Syrian--
160,000 Syrian refugees in

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
tents in the Middle
East, where this

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:90%
is the last thing we expect.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And to see the rain turn to
sleet and snow in that time.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And what, 32 foot
waves with hurricane

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.299 align:middle line:90%
Sandy in New Your Harbor.

00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:90%
We've never seen this kind of--

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: New York Harbor.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So how do you have drought and
floods in the same country?

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.794 align:middle line:90%
What is that dynamic?

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It's an imbalance.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.067 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what's
happening-- I'm

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:90%
a geologist, an earth scientist.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a climate scientist.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But the two are
very closely related

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.085 align:middle line:84%
because through
the earth we look

00:14:49.085 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:90%
at the climate of the past.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.574 align:middle line:84%
And one of the factors
is that our jet stream,

00:14:53.574 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics of the
jet stream, are changing.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people say the jet
stream is breaking down.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
The jet stream has
always been kind

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of a barrier between the
very cold air from the north

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and the moist warm air
coming out of the south.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I was with a group in
the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles of Mexico
in late December of 2013

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and early into January.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And when it's
supposed to be dry,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and pretty warm, and pretty
nice on the beaches in Mexico.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It was cold, it was rainy, it
was overcast for days on end.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.109 align:middle line:84%
Because that jet
stream is breaking down

00:15:32.109 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and allowing those
weather patterns to mix.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.452 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To come down.

00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So in saying that we
are in this, extremes

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
are the new norm, what
does that do for us now?

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:90%
How does that impact us?

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.365 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, that's
a good question, Lisa.

00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And for me it makes sense that
I think the first step-- there

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is a tendency, it's something
called normalcy bias.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Normalcy bias is
our tendency to look

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
at facts that impact
our lives in a big way

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and discount them or try to take
the rough edges off and smooth

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.012 align:middle line:90%
everything into normalcy.

00:16:01.012 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if it's not
happening in our own backyard,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.572 align:middle line:90%
we shut out.

00:16:04.572 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are
beautiful examples of this.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
There's stories of
Twin Towers, 9/11,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
people who successfully
left the towers

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and remember their computers
were still on in their desk.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They went back up into
the towers to power

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.355 align:middle line:84%
down their computer and
lock their desk drawer

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
so that everything
would be safe.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were caught when
the buildings collapsed.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Normalcy.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Or the classic example is
Europe in World War II.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
People in the ghettos seeing
their families and neighbors

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
being loaded onto boxcars.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.192 align:middle line:84%
They had heard the stories
of what was about to happen

00:16:38.192 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
want to believe it.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to believe
they were being relocated

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
to nice, new lives in
a new land somewhere.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was because it's
so hard to accept that.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's an extreme.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.002 align:middle line:84%
But the normalcy bias, it's
easy for people to say this.

00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And you hear it all the time.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Stay the course, things
will go back to normal.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.574 align:middle line:84%
Stay the course
with the economy.

00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go
back the way it was.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
Stay the course
with-- just hang on

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and everything's going to
go back the way it was.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
It will be OK.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that
is every time now we get

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.298 align:middle line:84%
hit with one of these
storms we act surprised,

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:90%
as if we were caught off guard.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's major news.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And the news does blow it up.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.895 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
If you know that you're
in a time of extremes,

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
you stop building homes, and
schools, and office buildings

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
on the floodplain
next to a river

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that you know is going to flood
every year when the rains come.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
When the high winds blow
down those power lines,

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
for example, people were without
power in eastern seaboard

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
after Hurricane Sandy
over two months.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was
they had a shortage.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get the telephone
poles out of the south up

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
into the area to put
the power lines back

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
up into the air in that very
fragile network that we use.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If we know we're in a time of
extremes, bury the power lines.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And especially when
they're knocked down

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:90%
when we go to rebuild them.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:90%
It's jobs.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:90%
There's jobs for people.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Bury them under the ground
like we do in many places.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
just some examples

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of how it changes
the way we think.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.656 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you suggest?

00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:06.219 align:middle line:90%
Everyone buy a motor home?

00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: No.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be really,
really clear with our audience.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.764 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
extremes it can sound scary.

00:18:12.764 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of
a bigger picture.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
breakdown of many things,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the economy,
or whether it's jobs,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's climate, whether
it's our relationship to oil,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:84%
peak oil in the middle--
all of those things

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:84%
are breaking down because
they're unsustainable.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.895 align:middle line:84%
The way we've thought
about them in the past.

00:18:28.895 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
I'm so optimistic.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are witnessing
the breakdown of so many things

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that are unsustainable,
it opens the door

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:90%
for all of the good news.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And the good news
is that we already

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
have the technological
solutions for the biggest

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
problems you could ever imagine.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to reinvent them.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:90%
We already have them.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We have all the food
to feed every mouth

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of every child, every
woman, every man

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.005 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the Earth today
right now at our fingertips.

00:18:53.005 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:90%
The food's not the problem.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to create
electricity and pump it

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
into the home of every family
the wants that electricity

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
without creating greenhouse
gases in a way that

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:90%
can't be weaponized.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:90%
In a way that is inexpensive.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's abundant, it sustainable,
we already have that.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
What we're missing
is the thinking

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that makes this a
priority in our lives.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the time of extremes

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
is the catalyst that opens
the door to that thinking

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and says to us, maybe we need
to look at things a little

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you really think so?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Because those
technologies, as I've

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
heard from many
different people,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.409 align:middle line:84%
are being suppressed
or taken out.

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They have
been in the past.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.469 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so where
is that technology?

00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They have
been in the past.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a different
world, Lisa.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.067 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll say is it
is a different world.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone knows
this world is changing.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.607 align:middle line:84%
I had a very interesting
program, a public seminar

00:19:44.607 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was offering
on the east coast.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.039 align:middle line:84%
You never know who's going to
show up in the DC beltway area.

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Interesting people.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had a man
that came up to me

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
who worked in one of
the agencies there.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me
confidentially--

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.517 align:middle line:84%
just between you and
me and our viewers.

00:20:01.517 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
What he said was, "There was a
time we felt like we understood

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
what this change was all about
and we had a handle on what was

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
going on," he said,
"but we don't.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.799 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- and
this is the language

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:90%
that I thought was interesting.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Something
is gone awry.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to figure
out where everything's going."

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said,
"Why are you here?"

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.818 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "I want to
see what your take is."

00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
What they see-- whoever
they are-- what they see

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is the awry, is
the wild card of us

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and how we respond
to so much change.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The world is changing faster
than we have been prepared

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
to accept in ways
that we've never seen.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
We have no blueprint.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And everyone to some degree
is in uncharted territory.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And to me that's why
I'm so optimistic.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.249 align:middle line:84%
It means that we've got to think
differently than we ever have.

00:20:46.249 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And we're all in this together.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.498 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I listen
to what you have to say.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been interviewing
you for over a decade now.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched the
books that you've come out

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.722 align:middle line:84%
with always seeming
too not only dig deeply

00:20:57.722 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:84%
into a subject that's
happening, where you've exposed

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
the fact that our Earth
is 11,000 years old.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And there's places--

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.181 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: A civilization.

00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:90%
A technological civilization.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In Gobekli Tepe.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've listened to
you for so long talk

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
about these things
that are really

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:90%
transformative, changing.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, you're
telling us what's

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in the
future, but not as a prophecy,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
but as something
that is truly being

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
recorded this time in history.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So in all of your travels and
everywhere that you've gone,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to the monasteries in Tibet
and to your incredible, vast

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:84%
travels to the Dead
Sea Scrolls, have you

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.489 align:middle line:84%
ever heard about this time
in history prophesized?

00:21:38.489 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a non-scientific
perspective for a second here.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.655 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure, yeah.

00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:43.872 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally
our ancestors-- well,

00:21:43.872 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:90%
it's interesting.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:90%
This comes back to the cycles.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The geology is showing
us very clearly,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago Earth went
through a major climate shift.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And they've only recently
arrived at this conclusion.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We talk about climate
change, typically

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about some time
way back during the dinosaurs.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
People living in
caves, dinosaurs.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.122 align:middle line:84%
They're not thinking
about so recent.

00:22:08.122 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So there hasn't been a
lot of study along that.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
What happened was a
group of scientists,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
they took information
from the Andes Mountains

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, and from Bolivia,
and seafloor sediments

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains
of the Himalayas,

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and Greenland in the ice
cores, and all through Europe.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And they put it all together.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And all the data from
the different places

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
told the same story of a big
climate change 5,000 years ago.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
because 5,000 years ago is

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
when the cycles of
our indigenous people

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.065 align:middle line:84%
say something big happened,
you can expect it again.

00:22:41.065 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
doing their best

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.715 align:middle line:84%
to prepare us through
their understanding.

00:22:44.715 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not scientific, but it's
their spiritual relationship

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:90%
to the earth.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you need
to take care of yourself

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.538 align:middle line:90%
and take care of one another.

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And honor the earth and be
able to grow your own food.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And they've said
it in these ways.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They've said, because this
is what we experienced.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you'll experience

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
when it happens again.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:90%
But 5,000 years is a long time.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And that story has
been twisted, it's

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
been defused a
little bit, diluted.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But the answer is
when I travel outside

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.305 align:middle line:84%
of the modern world-- we
call it the modern world,

00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
the technological
world-- everyone's

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:90%
expecting this change.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
It's only the modern world
that acts surprised and has

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
been caught off guard and
says, oh climate change.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what are they doing?

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are living
as they always have.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:90%
They live sustainably.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things they've done--

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and I think we can learn a
lot-- what they have done

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
is they've learned to
decentralize the way they live.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
They decentralize the
growing of their food

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:84%
into local community
areas so that when

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a big change, a big
storm or something like that

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
happens, they have
everything they need.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not relying on it to
be shipped from somewhere else

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.011 align:middle line:90%
like we are, many of us.

00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they
grow their own food,

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
they have their
own water sources,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and they live like communities.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.531 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They live
like communities.

00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And there's a distinction.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.444 align:middle line:84%
There's two words, there's self
sufficiency and self-reliance.

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They are as sufficient as
they can be within themselves.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.029 align:middle line:84%
But they are not opposed to
working with other people.

00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
do the best they

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
can to take care of themselves
to be as strong as they can.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And then to share their wisdom,
their knowledge, and their good

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:90%
with others in the community.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
That's very different from
a survivalist that says,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't need anything.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
In the true sense, survivalism,
you have only what you create

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.807 align:middle line:84%
and you consume
only what you need.

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
this is all about.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
This is all about community.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think community is
so important right now.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So how do you live?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%

We're an hour from the

water supply and food source?

00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The property
that I live on now, it

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
was a Waldorf school
built in the late 1800s.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was built for
self sustainability.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It was horribly dilapidated
when I bought it,

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's an ongoing
renovation process.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.704 align:middle line:84%
It's like that-- what was that--
the movie about the money?

00:25:11.704 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:90%
"The Money Pit?"

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's stuff you can't see.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.602 align:middle line:90%
It's all underground.

00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Pipes, and wells, and things.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But it had a couple
of good wells.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.895 align:middle line:90%
And we've learned how--

00:25:22.895 --> 00:25:25.345 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How to well
your own water?

00:25:25.345 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.714 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a part of
this self sufficiency

00:25:28.714 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and the change that
we're talking about.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.657 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine and
a neighbor-- and I'm

00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
going to share a
story because I think

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
it's a beautiful example
we can all relate to

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to adapt
to our time of extremes.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
He was a builder of green, very
sustainable homes, ecologically

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
sound homes back in
the-- well, for 30 years

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
he did this, up
until 2008 during

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
not only the economic crash
but the housing crash.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:90%
He lost everything.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And he had a crew of about 30,
35 people working with him.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't provide
for them any longer.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:90%
He said, what am I going to do?

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.787 align:middle line:84%
There's a very subtle,
very profound shift

00:26:07.787 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that happened in this man.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.744 align:middle line:84%
His name is Steve and maybe
we can all relate to this.

00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Typically when we
lose everything,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
we try to recreate--
because of normalcy bias

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
we try to recreate
what we've always

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.412 align:middle line:84%
known another way
somewhere else.

00:26:21.412 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
struggle and the suffering

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:90%
often comes from.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For safety though.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:90%
But that comes out of safety.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.888 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What Steve did,
he did something different.

00:26:27.888 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
He woke up one morning and
he didn't say, where can I

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:90%
recreate what I've always done?

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.099 align:middle line:84%
He said, what does
the world need?

00:26:35.099 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, what does
my community need?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
What does my family
need right now?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came
to him and said,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
they need to be able to
take care of themselves.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.864 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up
the next morning--

00:26:42.864 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
he's a builder for 30
years-- and he said,

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to build homes.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.501 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to take my skills.

00:26:48.501 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And he began to design,
prototype, and build

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
an innovative system of
raised bed self heating,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
self watering
covered greenhouses

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
that would allow people to
grow their own food no matter

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.034 align:middle line:84%
what the temperature, year
round, anywhere in the world.

00:27:03.034 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of them,
they're modular.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
12 inches square.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
You can put them on
a patio in New York

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:90%
if you don't have land.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Or they're four
feet by eight feet.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
You can put them in a
series like we have,

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
because we have
land in New Mexico.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
In January we were growing
broccoli, Swiss chard, lettuce.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It's 20 degrees
below zero outside.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And the key is that this
man is thriving in the worst

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:84%
economic downturn
in the 80 years

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
because he let go of his
expectation of waiting

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:84%
for things to get back
to normal and holding out

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
until he could
build his business.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
What he said was, what
does the world need now?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's a powerful
shift of heart and mind

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:84%
into recognizing that we
are community oriented.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And science is
actually supporting it.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Science has now discounted 150
years of Darwinian thinking,

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
telling us that nature is based
upon survival of the strongest.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That happens in
specific instances.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not the rule of nature.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
What the best science of
our time is telling us

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that nature is
based cooperation.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And what's called mutual aid.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Steve intuitively reflected
that in his question:

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:90%
what does the community need?

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:90%
How can I contribute and share?

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you see
nature based in cooperation,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
where there's-- we see the
perfect storm and all of that.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's a very
good question, Lisa.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.605 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me, you say
nature's based in cooperation.

00:28:28.605 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe
the best example

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is in the body that houses
the consciousness that's

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this chair
with me right now.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Or my body, or your
body as a viewer.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
We think we're individuals.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually made of about
50 trillion individual cells

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
that live as a community
and must cooperate and work

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.594 align:middle line:84%
together to give us the level of
vitality and health to be here.

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
When it breaks down,
we call it disease.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.400 align:middle line:84%
If it breaks down far
enough, we call it death.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the very
essence of our being,

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
we are shown every
moment of every day

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:84%
this fundamental principle
of nature, of cooperation.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the violent
competition-- it exists,

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not denying that--
when you see that,

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:84%
it is showing us how
far we have strayed

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
from nature's truest
rule of cooperation.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And when that
violent competition

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
becomes so prevalent, as
it is in our societies

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
today, it's a really
good indication

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
of how far we have
strayed from this deepest

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
truth of our
relationship with nature.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.479 align:middle line:84%
And the indigenous people,
as you asked me earlier,

00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
they share this with
me all the time.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.769 align:middle line:84%
They say, how do you
live in those cities?

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:32.885 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:29:32.885 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if everybody
leaves, how do you fix it?

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And they say, OK, good point.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.057 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing, but.

00:29:39.057 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's not a bad idea.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the reason why
you live in a remote area.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But how do we live
in these cities?

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
How do we deal with
this juxtaposition

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
of violence and love
in the same state?

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying is
that the body constantly

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
strives for that
state of homeostasis.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And that we will as a society?

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think this is
where resilience comes in.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the subtitle of the
book, creating resilience

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.029 align:middle line:90%
in a time of extremes.

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The idea of resilience,
it means different things

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Historically, it's
about the ability

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to spring back or return
to a normal functioning

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:90%
after a trauma.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Like get things back to
normal after Hurricane Sandy.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.492 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or the Arab Spring.

00:30:23.492 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Think about things like that.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.491 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Or a family
loses their loved one

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:84%
in the battlefield
of Afghanistan.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And they go back to work.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And they try to find--
create the resilience

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
to live their lives.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.111 align:middle line:90%
That's a good definition.

00:30:34.111 --> 00:30:35.996 align:middle line:84%
And it works, and
my question is,

00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
is there another
form, an expanded form

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:84%
of resilience, that allows
us to think and live

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
each day in a way that
makes room for the extremes?

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
incorporate the fact

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.682 align:middle line:84%
that we're living the extremes
into our everyday lives

00:30:52.682 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not surprised
when these things happen.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It's called expanded resilience.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The Stockholm
Resilience Institute

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.736 align:middle line:84%
is doing a lot of
work with this.

00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
a whole institute

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.193 align:middle line:90%
on resilience in Stockholm

00:31:04.193 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There is, because it's
such a vital part of our lives.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But the example that
I gave with Steve

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
going from building a
home, building green homes

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to these modular
raised bed greenhouses,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that is a very good
example of creating

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
that resilience in his
life by simply changing

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:90%
the way we ask that question.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, we used
to ask the question,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
what can I get from
the world that exists?

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we'd enter into
a relationship, a job,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.755 align:middle line:90%
a health care decision.

00:31:38.755 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we lived in
the Darwinian world,

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.127 align:middle line:84%
survival of the strongest, that
question actually makes sense.

00:31:46.127 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
But we don't live in that world.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So that means the question
now must change from,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:84%
what can I get from
the world that exists,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.554 align:middle line:90%
to what can I share?

00:31:53.554 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:90%
What can I contribute?

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:90%
What can I offer?

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
What can I give to the
world that's emerging?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning about
that in communities.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems
like the communities

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of microcosm
to fix the microcosm.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Because fixing the
world at this point,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
what do you see that
we have to go forward

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:90%
in the next 10 years?

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you see more, and
more, and more extremes?

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm encouraged
by what I'm seeing.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.395 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
I said I've never

00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
been more optimistic
about our lives.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I've never been more
optimistic about this nation.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The nation is going, US, a
lot of problems right now

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
and also a lot of opportunities.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I've never been more
optimistic about the world.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I have the opportunity
to see behind the scenes

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:90%
as well as what the public sees.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.640 align:middle line:84%
A dear brother, a colleague
and friend of mine,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Bruce Lipton--
I know you've

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:84%
worked with him in the
past-- he and I were invited

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
to speak at the United
Nations in October of 2013,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
just a few months ago,
sharing this message

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
innovators at the UN,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:84%
helping them to maybe hone
the direction of where

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:84%
some of those programs can
go from this point forward.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How was that received?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.273 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Very well.

00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Because they invited us.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.845 align:middle line:84%
But it's because of the
recognition that something

00:33:05.845 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
has changed,
something's different.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:90%
This isn't the Cold War years.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not the 20th century.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
We've got to think differently.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And that difference
is a subtle difference

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about
survival of the strongest

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and what's in it for me that
shift to recognizing that we

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.830 align:middle line:84%
live in a world of
cooperation and mutual aid.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:84%
What can we give, or share,
or offer, or contribute.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And in that way we're
helping ourselves.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about community.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
it's all about.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm curious
to see if you

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
have had any resistance
to this message.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're always
able to tell me,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.685 align:middle line:90%
what has the opposition been?

00:33:46.685 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Not really.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.435 align:middle line:90%
I haven't really had.

00:33:48.435 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't expect that
I would have much resistance

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:84%
because this isn't about
making anyone wrong.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not about attacking anyone.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It's about stating
truthfully, honestly,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:84%
factually the
information, the data.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is that
when we have the facts,

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
the choices become obvious.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:84%
When we have the facts,
we know what to do

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and what choices to make.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.504 align:middle line:84%
Its when things don't
make sense to us.

00:34:14.504 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
well just do this.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.586 align:middle line:90%
Or just do that.

00:34:16.586 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Or television says do this.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Or your local
officials say do that.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're saying, well, why?

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense because
you don't have the facts.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The most resistance
that I have had

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
is from the media
itself, not from anyone

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in any organizations,
political or government,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.365 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:35.739 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of them
would like for this information

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to get out.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.893 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how
to go about doing it

00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds political.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.892 align:middle line:84%
Or it sounds, there's
so much mistrust.

00:34:42.892 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But because I'm
not affiliated, I'm

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:84%
kind of a neutral
party sharing this.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you're saying that
the extremes are the new norm,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
then it takes the sensationalism
out of it as well.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.781 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't have
a reporter standing

00:34:51.781 --> 00:34:53.739 align:middle line:84%
there with the blowing
winds and the palm trees

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:57.009 align:middle line:84%
because this is, hi,
this is the new norm.

00:34:57.009 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And then, I mean, it's not sexy.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.627 align:middle line:84%
But it makes sense, though,
what you're talking about.

00:35:02.627 --> 00:35:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So I had asked you when
you were on my radio

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:90%
show about earthquakes.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And here we are in California.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't had a significant
earthquake for a long time.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.719 align:middle line:84%
And in certain areas when you
have a hurricane winds coming,

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:18.510 align:middle line:84%
at least you get a
little bit of a warning.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's bunkers for
those types of situations

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that hopefully
people can get into.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we are
shocked with an earthquake

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.719 align:middle line:84%
here in California and
there is no warning?

00:35:28.719 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, you know what
happens because you've seen it.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But the good news,
you say-- and this

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.596 align:middle line:84%
was a key word-- there hasn't
been a significant earthquake.

00:35:36.596 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist,
one of the things

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that fascinated me-- and I
did a lot of my field work

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.595 align:middle line:84%
in the Carpentaria Basin, which
is offshore of California.

00:35:43.595 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
was so interesting to me

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that there is so
much seismic activity here,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:90%
it almost never stops.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.399 align:middle line:84%
It is like a constant low
level rumble under the earth.

00:35:54.399 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Has it always
been like that?

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It's more so now.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say yes
or no, because I

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.649 align:middle line:84%
think our equipment now is
better able to detect what

00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:04.106 align:middle line:84%
may have always been happening,
but we just didn't know it.

00:36:04.106 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that it used to be,

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
when you think of
the earth moving,

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
you say, OK it stops
at this time of the day

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and it starts here.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult now to tell

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.930 align:middle line:84%
where one earthquake stops
and another one starts.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And the level one, level
two, on the Richter scale--

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.240 align:middle line:84%
very low level rumbling, which
is actually the good news

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
because it means there's a
constant low level release

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:84%
of the energy and the tension
that builds up along those

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
plates, rather than it being
totally quiet and then every,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.765 align:middle line:84%
60, 80, 100 years or so we
get this boom and everything--

00:36:35.765 --> 00:36:36.723 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Releases, yeah.

00:36:36.723 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's bat news.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is, there's
a constant release that

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
lessens the probability of
what's called the big one.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.149 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it cannot happen.

00:36:47.149 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lot of what
I've learned from you

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
through this interview and
reading the book is just

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to be prepared.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's something
that we hear all the time.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.837 align:middle line:84%
But get a situation together
where if there is an emergency,

00:36:58.837 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:84%
you have food, you
have water, and you

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:90%
have some energy source.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It makes sense because
of the reality that we face.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I begin the book by saying,
when you go on a journey.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:90%
We all know the story.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:84%
When you go on a
journey, you find out

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.571 align:middle line:90%
where you're going to go.

00:37:13.571 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You check it out,
you pack what you

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:90%
need to maintain your routines.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you find yourself going
somewhere you've never been,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:90%
you cover all the bases.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
You prepare for
all eventualities.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's precisely
what this book is about.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.059 align:middle line:90%
We are on a journey.

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
a different place.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to another world
within our lives right now.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that a new normal
is emerging and no one told us.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream,
there was no special

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.205 align:middle line:84%
on BBC, or CNN, or a glossy
expose, the world of the past

00:37:43.205 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But the key here--
and we talk about this

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.775 align:middle line:84%
in the live programs--
without the acknowledgement.

00:37:49.775 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be a big
ceremonial thing or anything.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.191 align:middle line:84%
But without the acknowledgement
that we no longer

00:37:54.191 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:84%
live in the world that we
have come to trust and rely

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:84%
upon in the past, we have never
been given the opportunity

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:05.600 align:middle line:84%
to mourn the passing of a way
of life and a way of living.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And without that mourning,
it's difficult to let

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.320 align:middle line:84%
it go to make room
for the opportunities

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and the good things.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The avenues of
abundance that are here

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.072 align:middle line:90%
for everyone right now.

00:38:18.072 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to think
about money differently.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
About economies differently.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.589 align:middle line:90%
About climate differently.

00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:90%
About energy differently.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's the new norm.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've
never really had

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
closure of the whole
recession conversation.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:84%
We've just been pushing
forward in multiple jobs,

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with the
layoffs, and all of that.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But how do you make space
for that new abundance?

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.565 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think the
mourning of the passing.

00:38:42.565 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And the live audience,
what I invite people to do

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is just take a little--
unless they're driving a car

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or operating heavy
machinery I ask them not

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
to-- but take a piece of
paper and just write down

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.200 align:middle line:84%
what's different
in your life now.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:84%
What's missing now that
was not there 10 years ago?

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know, even for me
there are things I miss.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
Borders Bookstore

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.652 align:middle line:84%
that was a landmark in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:39:04.652 --> 00:39:05.360 align:middle line:90%
I miss seeing it.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I miss little mom
and pop shops that

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:84%
used to fix my Tony
Lama boots when

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:90%
they get a hole in the bottom.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Or my glasses or whatever it is.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I miss that.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.588 align:middle line:84%
And it's not bad,
it's just saying,

00:39:15.588 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's different.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, it gives you
the opportunity for closure,

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
to let it go.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
OK it served us.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not here any
longer, but this is here.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Steve
is a good example.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The Congressional Budget
Office, CBO of the United States

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that the
economic environment that we're

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing now we can expect
at least until 2023.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.111 align:middle line:84%
That means we can expect
very low interest rates.

00:39:42.111 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It means it's hard to
make money on your savings

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.151 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking to put
your kids through school

00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:46.800 align:middle line:90%
or retirement.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We can expect very
high unemployment.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.127 align:middle line:84%
We can expect industries as
we've known them in the past,

00:39:52.127 --> 00:39:53.210 align:middle line:90%
they're no longer with us.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.959 align:middle line:84%
That means those jobs
in our neighborhoods

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:90%
are no longer there.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can expect the
devaluing of the currencies

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.430 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:90%
All of that at least until 2023.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
waiting for the world

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
to get back to normal,
they're missing life.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that normal is gone.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It can't come back.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:18.246 align:middle line:84%
But if you can adapt to what
this new extreme is all about,

00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Steve is a perfect example.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm not
going to recreate

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.334 align:middle line:84%
the way I made my
living for 30 years.

00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm going
to do something

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel good about
that people need.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.594 align:middle line:90%
And this is the key.

00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:28.760 align:middle line:90%
What is it that people need?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.111 align:middle line:90%
Not what do they want.

00:40:30.111 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:90%
What do they need?

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.564 align:middle line:84%
And how can you help
contribute to fulfill that need

00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:84%
for your family, your
friends, your neighbors?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.911 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that you are
rewarded tremendously.

00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, at the same
time-- I mean in Los Angeles

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.650 align:middle line:84%
particularly, this
winter didn't happen.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And we've had 80 degree
winter pretty much.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've said more than a few
times, I'm mourning winter.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just me missing
that time of coldness.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.352 align:middle line:90%
But what about nature?

00:40:56.352 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:90%
What about the animals?

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.893 align:middle line:84%
What about the--
what about the trees?

00:40:58.893 --> 00:41:01.120 align:middle line:84%
What about the fruits
and the vegetables

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have
that opportunity

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to go back into the ground,
to gather the nutrients so it

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:90%
could explode in spring?

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:84%
What about our ecosystem
that is mourning

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:90%
winter in our particular area?

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The ecosystem is
resilient in that it's already

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.380 align:middle line:90%
finding its balance.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.550 align:middle line:84%
at how quickly
this is happening,

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.999 align:middle line:90%
how quickly plants are adapting.

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of the insects
aren't, but they're

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the insects that were causing
problems to begin with.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
plants are adapting

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to shorter growing seasons
now, or multiple growing

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:90%
seasons in the same.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Avocados are

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Exactly,
because they don't

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.160 align:middle line:84%
have the emotional attachment
to the way something should be.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about this, when

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.250 align:middle line:84%
we talk about geologic
histories, big spans of time,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:54.590 align:middle line:84%
we have come to embrace
a way of living and being

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that we thought would always
be this way, whether it's

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.170 align:middle line:84%
technology, whether
it's climate.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Electricity is a
perfect example.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the brilliant
minds, late 1800s early 1900s,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:90%
the internal combustion engine.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Tesla and the power
grid that we have.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:84%
They all said we are
going to offer these now

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to make your lives easier.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a stepping stone or a
bridge to what comes next.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It was never meant
to be the end.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It was meant as a bridge
or a stepping stone

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:90%
toward a greater end.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We got stuck--
money, power, ego.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
We got stuck on
internal combustion

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.570 align:middle line:90%
engines, the burning of oil.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Oil is only a problem
when you burn it.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are 6,000 things
in our everyday lives

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:90%
that we rely upon oil for.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.455 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with combustion.

00:42:39.455 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
to demonize oil.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:90%
we don't want oil to go away.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But the burning of the
oil is the problem.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
We can stop burning oil today
and use that precious resource

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:84%
for all the other, the
medicines, and the delivery

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.845 align:middle line:84%
systems for the medicine,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tendency to
demonize the oil, which

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:90%
is I think is very unfortunate.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like throwing the
baby out with the bath water.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that we
grew accustomed to a world

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and expected it
always to be that way.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is the generation
where it's changing.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And that transitional
generation,

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.000 align:middle line:84%
the last time this happened
was 5,000 years ago.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And technology
didn't exist then also.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:24.680 align:middle line:84%

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%

Our way of living, or
trying to force the economy.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:90%
The genie is out of the bag.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
We've had nations that
had such great debt

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that other nations
could bail them out.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We've never been in the place
where the debt of the planet

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.940 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the
output of the planet.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Who bails out a planet?

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
the answer to that.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:84%
My sense is we're looking at
a huge shift, another program

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.070 align:middle line:84%
which is tied to
climate and the economy.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.420 align:middle line:84%
A huge shift in the way we think
about economies and the way

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:90%
we think about currency.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.950 align:middle line:84%

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to pull resources
from space now,

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:36.290 align:middle line:84%
for new areas of life,
and living, and energy,

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of systems.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of exploration
that's being done.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a lot about
it, but I've heard about it.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.209 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I've never
been more optimistic.

00:44:44.209 --> 00:44:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're at
a time-- biologists

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:90%
call this a point of crisis.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They say crisis is the
trigger for evolution.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Crisis to some people
sounds like a bad thing.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But to me, if it is crisis--
if you want to use that term--

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.297 align:middle line:84%
the good news is that
the crisis is still here,

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:84%
which means we still have
time to do something about it.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.070 align:middle line:84%
If the crisis were behind
us, that means it's over

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and the decision's been made.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So however we want
to look at it,

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.190 align:middle line:84%
this is a pivotal,
precious turning point

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.600 align:middle line:84%
in the history of civilization
and the history of our world.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have for the first time,
I think, the evolutionary edge.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And you just mentioned it.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Of the technology
that allows us,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:90%
that gives us the upper hand.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.320 align:middle line:90%
It's based in science.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But the key Lisa-- and this is
so important as a scientist.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Science doesn't have
all the answers.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Science can only
give us information.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom to
use that information,

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.340 align:middle line:90%
that comes from us.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the 5,000 plus years

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
of the wisdom of our ancestors
comes into play right now.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Is it ancient wisdom?

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Is it obsolete?

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.317 align:middle line:84%
They understood that we're
related to one another,

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.400 align:middle line:90%
were related to the Earth.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.304 align:middle line:84%
We need to honor our bodies, and
our Earth, and our relationship

00:45:58.304 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth as we
make these decisions.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, I don't
think we can go wrong.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We'll
that's why you didn't

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.890 align:middle line:84%
call the book,
The Tipping Point.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:90%
You called it The Turning Point.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Tipping points
are the frightening moments

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.430 align:middle line:90%
of no return.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Too much CO2, for example, and
the climate is beyond repair.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.482 align:middle line:84%
Or too much debt and
the economy collapses.

00:46:18.482 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The experts are really
good at telling us

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:84%
about tipping points,
frightening tipping

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:90%
points of no return.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.850 align:middle line:10%
What they neglect to tell us is
before you ever reach a tipping

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.890 align:middle line:10%
point, you must pass
through the turning point.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.050 align:middle line:10%
It's nature's way
of creating change.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.550 align:middle line:10%
The turning point
that says we never

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.230 align:middle line:10%
have to have those
frightening experiences.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.604 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want to
leave our listeners with today.

00:46:38.604 --> 00:46:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's good
to honor ourselves

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.170 align:middle line:84%
by acknowledging the degree,
the depth of the change,

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:46.120 align:middle line:90%
a time of extremes.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.360 align:middle line:10%
But the turning points
promise, they hold the promise,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.220 align:middle line:10%
that we may choose and
avoid that suffering

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.675 align:middle line:10%
to great abundance.

00:46:53.675 --> 00:46:56.810 align:middle line:10%
And my sense is that
we are on the precipice

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:10%
of the most beautiful world
and the most beautiful way

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.919 align:middle line:10%
of being as a global community
that we've ever seen.

00:47:02.919 --> 00:47:05.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: If you'd like to
watch a replay of my interview

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.090 align:middle line:10%
I've done with Gregg you
could go to gaiamtv.com.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I always
invite you to stay inspired.
