>>LISA GARR: If you don't
know what your purpose is,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
how do you find it?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
Purpose is the centerpiece
upon which you build success.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:90%
No purpose equals nothing.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:84%
These are the words
of Mastin Kipp,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and they're brilliant, not mine.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
He asked himself,
when he created

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
"The Daily Love," a daily blog
viewed by millions of seekers

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
who want to get in touch with
their purpose again, and again,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:10%
Mastin is the author of the
number one best selling book,

And according to Oprah, Mastin
is an up and coming thought

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:84%
leader of next generation
spiritual thinkers.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: You know what?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It's-- but it's real.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you live from
this really beautiful,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
authentic place, yet
you've created an empire.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.773 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>>KIPP: Well, we were
talking before the show,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:10%
it's really hard.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
You know, I think--

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:10%
my focus with "The
Daily Love" and then

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:10%
getting into the work I do
now with functional coaching,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.002 align:middle line:10%
I always ask the question, why?

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:10%
You know, when something
doesn't happen the way

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:10%
you want it to happen,
or if it does work out,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:10%
I always ask question
why, with clients why.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And it all kind of
bottoms out at some type

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
of emotional trauma that
we've had, some type of pain

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.845 align:middle line:90%
we've had in the past.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's what you do with
that that really matters.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.095 align:middle line:84%
And what's helpful
for me is, there's

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
always been a reason that's
propelled me to do what I do.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, it was
my mom had a broken back.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
She was given all the
fentanyl and the opiates

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors
could give her that

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
were-- we later found out
they were getting kickbacks

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.282 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But I always wanted to
help her be out of pain.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
driving force for me.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And then that kind of
translated into the career

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:90%
that I have now.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I do what I do.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I was in the entertainment
business very similarly.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.113 align:middle line:84%
And I left that because there
wasn't that sense of purpose

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
or meaning there for
me, once I realized

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that money, power, and prestige
don't get you that far--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's very fleeting.

comes to happiness.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.527 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: And so that's what--

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
for me, my mission now is
to end emotional trauma

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what drives me.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.667 align:middle line:90%
So if it's hard, you know--

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're used to it.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Bring it.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
You're used to it.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You're not-- not afraid of it.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's, if I could,
unwrap that a little bit,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of your past.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.525 align:middle line:84%
And you went through
this where you're really

00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
caring for someone
who you love, and then

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
also trying to make
it in the world.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Oh.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You got involved in
the entertainment industry.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
when you did that?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.902 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, I got into a very
large company called The Firm.

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were a
management company.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we had every
celebrity and every artist

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.807 align:middle line:90%
you could think of.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that was it.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I was 19 years old.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is it.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more I got
into it, I picked up

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.948 align:middle line:84%
drug habits and all kinds of
drinking, and stuff like that.

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the culture.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And I did it
for a girl though.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:90%
That's why I did it.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Because I wanted to fit in.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I never really had, like,
that type of attention before.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.065 align:middle line:84%
I was always very
introverted as a kid.

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.523 align:middle line:84%
So when a girl liked me, I was
like, well, whatever you do,

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll do.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I did it.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when the relationship
ended, a lot of that stuff

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:90%
ended, too.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
But It just was depleting.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.307 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a lot of
reciprocity in that business.

00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget,
one of my goals

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
was to manage a band
that had won a Grammy.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.565 align:middle line:90%
And I was working with--

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
on the management team for
Gnarls Barkley in 2007.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And we won two Grammys,
or something like that.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Two or three.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.717 align:middle line:84%
And we were nominated
for a bunch.

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I was walking
CeeLo down the red carpet.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I feel like
I'm in high school again.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel happy.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not OK.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.132 align:middle line:90%
Like, who cares?

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the real--
what's really going on?

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.243 align:middle line:90%
There's no connection here.

00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And, at that moment,
I realized, like, I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.035 align:middle line:84%
don't know what I'm going
to do, but this isn't it.

00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought I would be so
happy and elated, and I wasn't.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.852 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I've
had a couple like--

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, I call
them divine storms

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
where the universe seems
to conspire against you.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
There's always a wake
up call, you know?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And usually when
something that happens,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.025 align:middle line:84%
there's an underlying
pattern or trauma

00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
pattern that has to be healed
so that it doesn't happen again.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that
trauma pattern you say

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:90%
is at the base of everything?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, I-- so in
the world of spirituality--

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have a
very woo-woo core, OK?

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:90%
But I think if we're--

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings have
a human experience.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's focus on in the in
the body experience, right?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.948 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on
in this meat sack?

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I focus a
lot of my time and attention.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.725 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things
around the nervous system,

00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in, in
terms of how does it help you?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.345 align:middle line:84%
And why does it stop
you from moving forward?

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And it always
usually bottoms out

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.095 align:middle line:84%
to some type of survival motive
from the nervous system's

00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
perspective to why you
don't want to move forward.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And every person
in the world has

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.728 align:middle line:90%
some type of emotional trauma.

00:04:43.728 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
realize what trauma

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
is because they think it's
a physical injury, which

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:90%
it certainly can be.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But if your mother is not
emotionally in tune with you,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.445 align:middle line:84%
and your parents aren't
emotionally in tune with you

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
or proximal to you
when you were a kid--

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's trauma.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: --that's traumatizing.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding something
in emotional isolation,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:90%
that's traumatizing.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
depression, anxiety, fear,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
perfectionism,
procrastination, those

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
are all symptoms of
unresolved trauma.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I got frustrated
with my clients,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.383 align:middle line:84%
like, why are you
not doing this stuff

00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:10.823 align:middle line:90%
you said you wanted to do?

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And after asking
you why enough, I

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
realized something
hurtful in the past

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.388 align:middle line:84%
happened that's informing
the decisions now.

00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And why aren't we
talking about that?

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can't
change your thoughts,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
change your life without
acknowledging that really.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It's-- otherwise, it's you're
sort of willing yourself to do

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
But to change-- to really
change your thoughts,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you have to change
your emotional state.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And you have to change that--

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those
trauma patterns to be

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.257 align:middle line:84%
able to feel safe to
manifest certain things.

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Even with the law of attraction,
the same thing is true.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, to
raise your vibration

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:90%
it has to be safe to be there.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not safe
to be there for you,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to
raise it because it's not

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:90%
going to be safe.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So you'll fight
that tooth and nail.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.425 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're a really
intuitive being, aren't you?

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: I mean, yeah.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I believe in intuition.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But my definition of
intuition is sort of

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
like more somatic
like nudges, and then

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:90%
with pattern recognition.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like there's
a phrase from the Islam

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like, trust Allah,
but tie up your camel.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.752 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like believe
in both of those ideas.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely make
intuitive style decisions.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I definitely trust
my gut for sure.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't have visions of things.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.618 align:middle line:84%
I just have a feeling, a
felt sense of certain things.

00:06:18.618 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:90%
But I also love the data.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of
like half analytics

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.798 align:middle line:90%
and then half intuition.

00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of
the two is powerful.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are a lot of
people that are watching

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:90%
right now that says, that's me.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yeah.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot of sense.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
work with people,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.312 align:middle line:84%
you work with people in terms
of-- you call them clients.

00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But these are people
that have come

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to you that really want to
work out trauma in their life,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yeah.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, they want to--

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
usually when
someone comes to me,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:90%
they've done the meditation.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
They've done the chanting.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
They've done the--
like all the things

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.673 align:middle line:84%
that you think someone would
do, and they've come far.

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they-- they're
not-- it's not working.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.423 align:middle line:84%
But they've hit this
upper limit where

00:06:57.423 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
they can't go any further
because they haven't gone

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
internal in terms of what's
going on with their trauma

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
history, right?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about spiritual--

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.903 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual world, and the
personal development world,

00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and the mental health world--
they all have it in common--

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
which is unintentional-- or,
well, in the mental health

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
space, it's intentional.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But the other two,
unintentional trauma of denial,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
where they say, oh,
don't talk about that.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.313 align:middle line:84%
That's the negative thinking,
or that's a limiting belief.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Reframe it to
something over here.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's like actually what's
called dismissive positivity,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:90%
where you're like, oh, no.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.833 align:middle line:90%
Just change your thinking.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.003 align:middle line:84%
Without being able to witness
and empathize with someone

00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%
in that current state.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go back and read
like the old Abraham material,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I just recently reread
it, because I was like,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'm crazy.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:10%
If you go back and read that
stuff, they-- in chapter 7

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.188 align:middle line:10%
or 8 of "Ask and It Is Given,"
they talk about trauma.

00:07:46.188 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the better
feeling or thought

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
is just something
that's relieving.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And being witnessed
in your trauma

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is very-- a very powerful
relieving situation to be in.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
reframe how we look

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of the
spiritual material

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.665 align:middle line:84%
and the personal
element material

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to be trauma informed, not
so that we can stay negative,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:84%
but so that we can
witness somebody's wound

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of empathy
and compassion,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and then help them
out of it from there.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And we want to meet
people where they are.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
help people do, is

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
they've tried a lot
of stuff, and they

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
want to go the next level but
their nervous system won't

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.402 align:middle line:90%
let them because it's not safe.

00:08:18.402 --> 00:08:20.652 align:middle line:84%
And we find out why,
because of their history.

00:08:20.652 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's more of
a spiritual bypass--

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Totally.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.382 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can go to
this mountaintop,

00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or do this practice, and
never pay attention to the--

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.358 align:middle line:84%
and then I've heard
so many times,

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:90%
oh, you don't need to go there.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
remember the trauma.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to remember it.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It's-- that
is-- that-- what--

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
when someone says that,
what they're saying is,

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.304 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
help you with that.

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Right?

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's not you
have to live there.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you
have to dwell on it,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:90%
and ruminate on it.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nobody wants
to go back there.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But when people
realize, like, oh, my god.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why I do this
behavior, that make sense.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't have to
be ashamed about that.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I've actually done a really
good job surviving up until now,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:90%
staying safe.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Like, good job.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
I untucked the mic.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Good job, you know?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Then it gives context
to changing the behavior

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we take this
perfectionistic kind of idea

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.032 align:middle line:84%
and imposter syndrome,
and we apply it

00:09:07.032 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:84%
to personal development
and spirituality,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and we beat ourselves
up for things

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that are our survival
defense mechanisms

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.845 align:middle line:90%
that have kept us safe.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
acknowledge that,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that's how we start to get free.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I ask you a question
about the quote "millennial

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%
generation."

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.272 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to label or
put anyone in or put anyone

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:24.147 align:middle line:90%
in a category, right?

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about
maybe 20-, 30-somethings.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
When it's such an
amazing time and culture

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
for this group of people because
they're in this incredible tech

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
world, where things can
move so fast, but yet

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:90%
it keeps us so external.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yes

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Very connected,
but external.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
All of the attention
is on the external.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So where is that authenticity,
that daily practice,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.967 align:middle line:84%
and what will happen
in their 40s and 50s?

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, can you help
me understand that?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yeah, well, I think--

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that's a big question,
because where we're heading

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%
is man and machine merging, OK?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not man-- like, James
Cameron, man versus machine.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
No, it's man becomes
and merges with machine.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.105 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's happening.

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, you have a phone
and you're already

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:90%
uploading things to the cloud.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
You're already starting
to merge with it.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.528 align:middle line:84%
But it's the appropriate amount
based on what's healthy for us.

00:10:15.528 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge
study that just came out

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
from the World Health
Organization about how

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of screen
time actually prohibits

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.403 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitter
production and is

00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe one of the main causes
of a lot of the mental health

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:90%
issues we're having right now.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So too much screen time,
just like anything, right?

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Too much water is not
good for you, either.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Too much screen
time is not good.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What's beautiful about
it is that there's

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.308 align:middle line:84%
a lot of strength in it, because
the diversity is accepted.

00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Because kids these days,
and millennials, like,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
they know about
everything globally.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.382 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: The problem
is, there's a lot

00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of emotional disconnection
and isolation

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because relating
to a screen is not

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:84%
the same as what we're doing
right now, co-regulating person

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to person.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And also being
known and being seen

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and being heard by important
people in your life.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what
we need as a person

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and as a species to be able
to thrive emotionally and have

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:90%
all of our systems work--

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
coupled with the idea of
having a purpose and meaning.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So having that external
drive is important,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but what my prediction is is
that all of the stuff that's

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be, you know, like,
basic kind of stuff that's,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
like, transactional things
is going to be replaced

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
by artificial intelligence.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And the skill of
the future that's

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be most important
are interpersonal skills,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to learn how to
connect with other people

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.803 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the most
important skill set moving

00:11:26.803 --> 00:11:28.413 align:middle line:84%
forward because all
the other stuff,

00:11:28.413 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
like the transactional stuff, is
being more and more taking care

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:90%
of every day, right?

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But that
interpersonal dynamic,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.975 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
the division we're

00:11:35.975 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
having in the world today, it's
all interpersonal conflict.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Because-- so I go to
this one particular bank,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and you have to go through--
get that arm, and the ticket,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and then when you leave
there is a guard shack there,

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and I always used to have a nice
interaction with that person.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:90%
The guard shack got torn down.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:90%
It replaced it with a machine.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, the machine didn't work.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.357 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, these
people had to stand

00:11:59.357 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
outside, without a
shack, in the heat,

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and hand the
tickets, which was--

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
it just seemed-- the whole
thing just seemed wrong.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was the example
of technology replacing

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
humans, and then technology
breaking, and then

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:90%
human suffering.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] But
there is eventually

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
going to have to be
that inner connection,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that interpersonal peace,
that needs to exist.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it will always
have to be there.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I might be old-school--

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: No.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
saying the same thing.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.827 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It has to be because--
well, if you look at, like,

00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
the types of problems humanity
has faced over the years,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
even though what's happening
today is atrocious and cannot

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
be excused, way
better than, like,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
worldwide bubonic
plague outbreaks,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:90%
the Crusades happening.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, the quality of
our life in general

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.185 align:middle line:84%
has improved exponentially as
technology has moved along,

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening now is, we
don't have these basic survival

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
problems for the
most part anymore.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Certain communities
and certain places

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
obviously are still
marginalized and do.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But as a whole, humanity
and our life expectancy,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:90%
all these are going up, OK?

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The first person to
be 125 is alive today.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So, like, all that's amazing,
and so the problems that we're

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
having now are more
interpersonal problems

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding of,
like, what's your experience

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and what's my
experience, and how

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to coexist with
different experiences

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
when we disagree about
passionate things.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.218 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we
have to figure out.

00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:21.198 align:middle line:84%
And because, you know, it's
for sure the basic tasks

00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
removed more and more

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and more every day by artificial
intelligence and automation,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.283 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to make
our life more abundant,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but to really enjoy it, we have
to do our interpersonal work.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:90%
So the future for people--

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you're
starting college right now,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
please focus on
philosophy, focus

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
on interpersonal dynamics,
focus on attachment theory,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:90%
focus on these types of things.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, most people
who are in college right now,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
if they're starting
as a freshman,

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
by the time they graduate,
their job won't exist.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've said
that-- yes, absolutely.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I have one going
into college soon,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.243 align:middle line:84%
and so yes, when she gets out,
it's all going to be changed.

00:13:58.243 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Psychology is a great
degree because you

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
need to know the study of human
beings, which we're always

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
going to be.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it is definitely
a changing environment.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So how does this
relate to purpose?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.195 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, so
there's going to be,

00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and-- well, there
already is, but there

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
will be more major
existential issues

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:90%
around what is my purpose.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if I don't-- if I'm not
supposed to be a bank teller,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and my job's been
eliminated, now what?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.345 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the data, both--

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
all the spiritual texts
already talk about purpose.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- you know, Wayne Dyer,
Rick Warren-- everyone talks

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
about purpose, so we know that.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The clinical data
is fascinating.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a peer-reviewed
study that just came out

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.117 align:middle line:84%
that shows that, when you have
a sense of purpose in life,

00:14:35.117 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
it reduces all-cause mortality,
meaning you live longer.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It can add up to 10 to
15 years to your life.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It can, like, reduce
the bad cholesterol,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:90%
increase the good cholesterol.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.103 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
biomarkers that can improve.

00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And in our work, what I've
seen with our clients is,

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
when someone has a sense
of purpose, meaning,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:90%
why am I doing this?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:90%
What's driving me?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.773 align:middle line:90%
What's motivating me to do this?

00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do I care about this?

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:90%
They earn more.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:90%
They give more.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
They share more.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They become healthier, and it
contributes to a healing path,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, if you don't
have a sense of purpose, that's

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
where you go to depression
and all kinds of negative,

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.535 align:middle line:84%
down-- because we're born
to have meaning and use.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:90%
We have to have usefulness.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.668 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And it can change
and shift over time, right?

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.877 align:middle line:84%
But the emotional states
tend to stay the same, which

00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
is a good indicator.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.542 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if you
have multiple purposes?

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have side
hustles and many different jobs,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%
multiple jobs.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
What if there's
multiple purposes?

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.687 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, so if you
look at the data and--

00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I obsess over this stuff, right?

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please!

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So when you're engaged
in whatever your purpose, what

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
you're really loving is your
emotional state in that time,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, yes.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.517 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And so, no matter what
the physical manifestations

00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
are, you want to
make sure you're

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.428 align:middle line:84%
hitting those emotional targets,
which is why we have-- you

00:15:44.428 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
know, we set a goal
because we want to be

When a relationship-- usually,
someone's state of relationship

aliveness, growth.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's what people
want in a relationship.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Financially, it's, I want
to feel free or safe, right?

>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And so you
want to keep your focus

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.538 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional
content, and you

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
want to-- that's
that self-awareness,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.313 align:middle line:84%
that somatic intelligence,
that helps us understand

00:16:16.313 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
how am I feeling,
and then what do

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I have to do to feel this way?

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I started getting
into sort of the mental health

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and trauma space,
because what prevents you

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.962 align:middle line:84%
from feeling those
emotions of purpose

00:16:24.962 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
are past traumas and your
nervous system trying

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to keep you safe.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I kind of
took a left turn into that work,

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.088 align:middle line:84%
because everyone
wants to feel good,

00:16:34.088 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
but there's so many
reasons why they don't.

Well, what about when you're
passionate about something,

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and you know that's
your purpose,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and it just isn't working?

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just not working out?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Is that unresolved
emotional trauma?

>>KIPP: May-- well,
yes, it depends, right?

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.863 align:middle line:84%

00:16:51.863 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:90%
"yet," right?

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't worked out yet.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.565 align:middle line:84%
So it's how long are
you in the game, right?

Marriage, counseling,
divorce, attorneys, and stuff.

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:84%
So who knows if it's
actually a happy ending.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's earned every

be unresolved trauma,

00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you a
really good example.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:90%
So we had a client once.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
She came to us just
off food stamps,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and she was trying to break
through financially in her

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
business, and she just
couldn't, and she couldn't.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
With enough intervention
and conversations

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
over about an hour or so, got
down to her trauma history,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:90%
which was significant.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why she wasn't
moving forward on Instagram

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't selling
stuff is because she

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
felt, if she was public,
her nervous system thought

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:90%
she'd get hurt again.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
If I'm seen, if I'm seen

00:20:31.058 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:10%
Even in the face of people
you despise, you can't stand,

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:10%
you can't tolerate, underneath
these awful values and this

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:10%
behavior that you cannot
justify as anywhere near OK,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:10%
underneath that is trauma.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Which means that you
can love that person

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:10%
but not like that person, just
as Gandhi, Martin Luther King,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:10%
and the original Christian
values ask us to do, as well,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:10%
and it's the time
to practice that.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: His mission of
wanting to end trauma,

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
he's doing just that.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
He just realizes that we
all experience trauma--

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.308 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: That's how
addiction rolls.

00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: --and it needs
to come up, be looked at,

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and be healed so that
we can move forward.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: That's why I created
Functional Life Coaching,

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and it basically helps
people rapidly identify

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.578 align:middle line:84%
and accelerates
the healing of what

00:21:11.578 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
those root mental and
emotional causes are.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.138 align:middle line:84%
I'm the most unlikely character
to work with mostly women.

00:21:16.138 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the women
I work with are also

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of minority
status, and they're feeling

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:90%
very marginalized right now.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.403 align:middle line:10%
And what I know to
be true is, there's

00:21:22.403 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:10%
underlying emotional trauma.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It must feel so good
to help people at that level.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, it's weird because
that's where I live, like,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:90%
365 days a year.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's weird not to help
people at that level now.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, when
we have conversations

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that are a little bit more
surface, I'm like, no, no,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk
about your history.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.935 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing is,
people are becoming

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:90%
more and more open to that.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It's not so passé and
so sort of not talked about

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:90%
as much.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.042 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is it
when someone comes

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to one of these amazing
events, what is it that they're

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:90%
hoping to change in their life?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: It depends.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We work a lot with a
lot of entrepreneurs

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.205 align:middle line:84%
and practitioners, so
you know, people still

00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:90%
want the same stuff, right?

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They want money.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:90%
They want love.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And they want to be
fit, and they want

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.268 align:middle line:90%
to be happy, basically, right?

00:22:07.268 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they
want, but they're

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
realizing that what
they have to do to get

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
there is maybe a
different approach

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
than they've taken before.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.168 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at things through

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that trauma-informed
lens, what's amazing is,

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.555 align:middle line:84%
purpose is one of
the best things

00:22:18.555 --> 00:22:19.955 align:middle line:90%
to help heal trauma, for sure.

00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But also, the things
that you did that maybe you

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
felt bad about or hurtful about,
or you were mad at yourself

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
about, or guilt or shame,
start to make a lot more sense.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You start to go, oh,
that's why I did that.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, that was a
defensive strategy.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And even if it's--

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, we were talking about
this-- you know, kale, right?

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm eating my
kale salad, right?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
That's better than
shooting up heroin.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm not addressing
my emotional stuff,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.755 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not looking
at my history,

00:22:42.755 --> 00:22:45.575 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not looking at my
somatic or my felt emotions that

00:22:45.575 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
are coming up, and I'm
pushing those down,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:84%
no kale is going to
help you regulate

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:90%
those emotional states.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Now they can absolutely
help you have

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory
properties and not

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
have inflammatory
responses, which

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.143 align:middle line:84%
also cause emotional
problems and dysregulation.

00:22:59.143 --> 00:23:00.643 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, you still

00:23:00.643 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
have to do your emotional
work, and that's

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:90%
where everything exists.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're saying
things like kale or too much

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:84%
exercise or too much yoga
are all coping mechanisms

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to overcome or to kind
of hide the trauma?

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: If you don't
do the trauma work.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:90%
They're not bad, right?

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm not against
the kale salad.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against
a green smoothie.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against any
of those things.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it's kind of
like the people who go vegan,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
but all they eat are vegan,
gluten-free chocolate chip

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:90%
cookies.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, well, you're vegan,
but you're not healthy, right?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can do yoga
all day long--

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for yoga--

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
but if you're not doing
your somatic work;

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
what your history is

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and why you lash out
at people; if you

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to repair a
relationship where there's

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
a fight or a hard
thing happened,

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and you just kind of blame
them or kind of differentiate

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
yourself and just kind
of do your own thing.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Or if you avoid it, or if
you collapse and only do

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.976 align:middle line:84%
what the other person wants,
kale's not going to save you.

00:23:57.976 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't beat up my kale?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
I love my tail.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I
understand, though, yes.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.205 align:middle line:84%
It can also go into that
spiritual bypass category.

00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.847 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we want to get
into the weeds with it.

00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
When you do the videos
that you do, and they

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
get hundreds of thousands of
views, when you're putting

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
something like that
together, where

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.905 align:middle line:84%
do you reach from in order
to find where people are at?

00:24:21.905 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get that from?

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, I, um--
well, a couple of things.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I always-- I love working
with people and, like,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
hearing their stories and
seeing what's trending

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:90%
with our clients, right?

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because there's common
themes, usually.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I like to speak
from that place.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Once we get down below
the kind of formalities

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and the easy talk, weed under
what's really up for somebody.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I like speaking to
that part of people.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a truer place.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's below, you know, Republican
or Democrat or black or white.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, at a
soul, human level.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I like to talk there, and
I know I'm onto something

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:90%
if I'm scared to say it.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:24:57.845 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So I say the
stuff I'm scared to say.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Not because I want to be
defiant and just kind of, like,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:90%
go, like, whatever to somebody.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.327 align:middle line:90%
But like, ooh, this one's--

00:25:05.327 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:90%
that's a hard one for me to say.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to say that?

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
That's when I know I'm
really onto something,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.577 align:middle line:84%
and when I came out with
the Claim Your Power book--

00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, I wrote it
before Donald Trump

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:90%
got elected, right?

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And then he
got elected, and I

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
was like, how do I market this?

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Like, I don't even know how to--

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, it's
going to take a year

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.252 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
market it in that era,

00:25:23.252 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:84%
because everything
changed, right?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: The political, social
environment completely changed.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel right to just
market a book about purpose.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.788 align:middle line:84%
Because it had to
mean something, right?

00:25:32.788 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had to also
figure out, well, I

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.455 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of Republican
friends who voted for him,

00:25:36.455 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:90%
and they're not racist, and--

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: My liberal friends
aren't snowflakes, you know?

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Conscious
conservatives, yes.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So like, what are
we talking about, actually?

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then how do I talk about
race and all those things?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.902 align:middle line:84%
So I took some time to
really think that through,

00:25:47.902 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to be able to actually
have a conversation

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and not have what happened
to, say, Matt Damon when

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
he talked about Me Too and there
was this big backlash, right?

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you would be
furthering the polarization.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You want to bring
the divide closer.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.385 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.385 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the only
way to really do that

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:90%
is through the heart.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And to talk about
the underlying issues

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:90%
without it negating something.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can never understand
what racism feels like.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I have white privilege.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
That's something-- I have
white male privilege.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: I don't
have any clue what

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.985 align:middle line:84%
it's like to be an
African-American woman.

00:26:14.985 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's honest, yes.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.268 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: No clue, right?

00:26:17.268 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And whatever I've been through
with my traumatic history

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
doesn't-- that doesn't
negate my traumatic history.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And someone who isn't
in that perspective,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't negate their
traumatic history.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
If we can actually have
a conversation about,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
how are you coping?

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.852 align:middle line:90%
How am I coping?

00:26:30.852 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:90%
What's working for you?

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at, for example,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
the African-American community,
amazing coping strategies.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Gospel bunches-- I mean, so much
co-regulation and community,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Right?

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, went to a gospel
brunch once, and I was like,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
what do I have in my life
that brings me this much joy?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know!

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's spirit-raising!

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.295 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:46.295 --> 00:26:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Why did I-- who-- no
one told me about this, right?

00:26:48.753 --> 00:26:51.336 align:middle line:84%
Like, I want to go gospel brunch
every day from now on, right?

00:26:51.336 --> 00:26:52.136 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:26:52.136 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But when we
meet at that level--

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that's why I could have
conversations with our clients

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.885 align:middle line:84%
who happen to be a minority
or African American

00:26:57.885 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
about what's really
true for them

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and, also, witness
what is it like for you

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:90%
to experience racism every day.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that like?

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And I can learn, too.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But I also know
that, underneath that,

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:84%
there's still that
disconnection.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
There's still the
emotional dysregulation,

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's-- when
you dwell there,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.525 align:middle line:84%
it's below the
superficial things.

00:27:17.525 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's one of
those things where,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
when you focus on the pain,
you're going to get more pain.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
If you focus on
the trauma, you're

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.010 align:middle line:84%
going to get more
trauma, but there's

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
a strange thing that
happens, though,

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
when someone talks
about the trauma,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and the conversation
goes to this--

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:90%
I know you've heard this before.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
(IN GENTLE VOICE) All
you need to do is love.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything is about love.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.916 align:middle line:84%
When you go to love,
then everything's OK.

00:27:39.916 --> 00:27:40.716 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: [CHUCKLES]

00:27:40.716 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [CHUCKLES] Do you
know that conversation?

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.757 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, the
thing about it--

00:27:43.757 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's true, but it
gets us disconnected again.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It's kind
of like sequencing,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
like what do you say
in what order, right?

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.760 align:middle line:10%
So if someone comes
you, and they say--

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.238 align:middle line:10%
someone you really love--

00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:56.655 align:middle line:10%
you know, oh, my
god, I'm thinking

00:27:56.655 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:10%
about killing myself, right?

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:10%
That would-- for most people,
you would be so scared, right?

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's the response.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all, do
you have a plan?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.252 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is no,
then it's probably not

00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:90%
going to be a big deal.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
you say is, thank

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
you so much for telling me.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.537 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you feel safe
enough to tell me that.

00:28:10.537 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Just that, right there, they're
going to feel a ton of relief.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
sharing it with you.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with depression.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm so depressed.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, oh, go to rehab or
go see a shrink or psychiatrist.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Go, thank you for
telling me that.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
You-- people-- you need to
have that level of validation.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And empathetic witness
to someone's pain

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is, like, the first
step to healing trauma.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Now if you do that too much,
that becomes commiserating,

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
so you want to elevate
beyond it at some point.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't start there,
you can't build on top of it

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:90%
with the higher principles.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So love is a great idea,
but there is a step process

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, that
is love, though.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
If you say to
somebody, like, that

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:90%
must be really hard for you.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.195 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Thank you
for telling me.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:90%
That's love, right?

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's just not-- it's just
not, now feel better, right?

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.622 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is what The
Daily Love was built on?

00:28:57.622 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Um-- yeah, I think so.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
What The Daily Love was,
really, sort of a creative arts

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:90%
therapy for me, right?

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was just kind of writing
about what I was going through,

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of my
own personal therapy

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:90%
out loud for people.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.725 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Every day.

00:29:08.725 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's
pretty much what

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.450 align:middle line:90%
you've always done, though.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yeah.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That-- yeah.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.707 align:middle line:84%
But then there's these
great strategies.

00:29:13.707 --> 00:29:16.055 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole idea
of what to do, and really

00:29:16.055 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
spend some time
writing in your journal

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:84%
about coping with
different things

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and how your coping strategies
are working or not working,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:90%
what you've missed out on.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And I love this, that you have.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't have
a great romance,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%
what have I missed out on?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.277 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have a
great career or job,

00:29:33.277 --> 00:29:34.360 align:middle line:90%
what have I missed out on?

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.735 align:middle line:84%
And you really-- can you go
through some of those with us

00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
to help us understand what to--

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:90%
what that dichotomy does?

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, so
the thing about it

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is that, like-- so
the name of the game

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
is emotional regulation.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:90%
This thermostat, right?

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.748 align:middle line:84%
So if-- you know, you have
a thermostat in your home.

00:29:50.748 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:84%
If it gets too hot,
then it turns on the AC

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.343 align:middle line:90%
and cools it down.

00:29:53.343 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
If it gets too low, it turns
on the heat and brings it up.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Same thing is true-- when
you talk about someone

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
who's bipolar,
they're high and then

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:90%
they're low emotionally, right?

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.827 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So the goal is, you want
to stay within a certain range.

00:30:02.827 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
If you go too above a range,
you go beyond a threshold,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you have, like,
psychotic breaks and things you

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:90%
don't want to have, right?

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If you go too low, that's
when you get major depressive

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.982 align:middle line:84%
So you want to stay
within a certain range,

00:30:12.982 --> 00:30:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and the goal is to
figure out, what

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.815 align:middle line:84%
do I need to do
to feel that way?

00:30:15.815 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's the most
important to do these days

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:84%
is not isolate, physically
and emotionally.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:84%
To learn how to be
counted on and how

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to count on other people is like
the most important skill set,

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's something that's
very hard to do today.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So, like, you can sit there
and do your breathing exercises

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.333 align:middle line:90%
and your Kundalini yoga.

00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can do all
that stuff-- awesome.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing it in
isolation-- and I'm not--

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying-- someone
could be five feet from you.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You could be laying
next to someone in bed,

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
but if you're not sharing
your innermost self

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:84%
with that person, you could
be an inch away from someone

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.708 align:middle line:90%
and all alone, right?

00:30:48.708 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal is to learn how
to create a relationship, two

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
or three, where
you can actually be

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
able to share that
part of yourself

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.273 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of an empathetic
witness who's not going

00:30:57.273 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to judge you, who's not
going to try to change you,

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:84%
who's not going to
try to go, OK, now

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:90%
go do something different.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm
just here with you.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:84%
That is the most
important emotional skill

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.438 align:middle line:90%
set that you can have.

00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:08.980 align:middle line:84%
An event-- and what's
interesting is,

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:84%
when emotionally that
is witnessed-- you know,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell
is a great quote,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.083 align:middle line:84%
"Every feeling fully
felt is bliss."

00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you get to
stay with a little bit

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
longer, bring your
awareness to it,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.553 align:middle line:90%
and it will transform, right?

00:31:19.553 --> 00:31:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're too busy trying to
change it, negate it, reframe

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:90%
it, breathe it away, whatever.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.597 align:middle line:84%
To just-- we never
quite get there.

00:31:25.597 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the most important

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.555 align:middle line:84%
emotional regulation
strategies that are out there,

00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is that interpersonal
connection is so huge.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is that
more about community,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
or is it something
different than being

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:90%
a part of a community?

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.847 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It's-- community
is important, for sure.

00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at,
like, John Bowlby's work

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:84%
on attachment
theory, which is sort

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of how we build
interpersonal, psychological,

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and emotional bonds,
we have a core

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.255 align:middle line:84%
need to have a special
someone or someones--

00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
a very small number
of people who

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.648 align:middle line:84%
are the most important
people to us.

00:31:55.648 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we have those
people in our lives,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:90%
that's why when we lose--

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The only thing-- that's
called secure attachment.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's hard
about secure attachment

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to lose
it at some point, right?

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But when
you have it, like,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.527 align:middle line:84%
you want to share the
good stuff with them,

00:32:07.527 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and you want to share the
bad stuff because that's

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
how we regulate as
beings, as human beings.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you mean-- back
to losing it at some point,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:84%
you mean when the person,
like a child, moves away,

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:90%
or a parent dies or something?

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
well, a dog passes--

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And that's why
people are so scared

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of having that
secure attachment.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes!

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Because I'll lose
it, but it's like, well--

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
so let's assume, yes,
you're going to lose it,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.720 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to enjoy
it until you lose it.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that
you're going to lose it

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.695 align:middle line:90%
makes it even more special.

00:32:32.695 --> 00:32:34.403 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it goes
back to the trauma,

00:32:34.403 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
though, because when it
was lost the last time,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you never fully
recovered from it.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever want to have
a deep, intimate relationship

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
again in fear of
having that pain

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
again, that experience
of that loss.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.802 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Which is actually living
in that loss daily, right?

00:32:46.802 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, culture
trains us for this, right?

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Like, how many times
in every movie, right

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
when someone gets the thing they
want, it's ripped away, right?

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes!

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And the messaging
is, you can want something,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:90%
but you can't have it.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then,
why want it at all,

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and there goes the
purpose, out the window.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Exactly.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Versus, like, hey-- and
that's what I love about Brené

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Brown's work.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:84%
She talks about
being in the arena.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Part of being in the arena is
going to someone that you love

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you know, you
actually have my whole heart,

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and can you please
be careful with that?

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:84%
That is so scary, to
count on somebody.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, that is so scary.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.247 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: But that's
the good stuff!

00:33:20.247 --> 00:33:21.713 align:middle line:84%
That's where all
the good stuff is.

00:33:21.713 --> 00:33:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what if that
person lets you down?

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, so the cure
for that is-- first of all,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
so if you're in an
abusive relationship,

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.468 align:middle line:90%
that's not your person.

00:33:29.468 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say
that as a disclaimer.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:90%
But they will let you down.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.005 align:middle line:84%
So the goal in a relationship is
to learn how to repair, right?

00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a good
repair strategy--

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:84%
so I have a repair strategy
with my partner Jenna.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I get
triggered-- regularly,

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's just
how life is, right?

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What we do, yeah.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And so, like, I kind
of get, like, kind of like--

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I get kind of, like,
high and mighty

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
when I get triggered
sometimes, and I don't

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:90%
want to admit I'm wrong, right?

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of my thing.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.495 align:middle line:84%
So usually, I need,
like, 20 or 30 minutes,

00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and when I realize
I'm triggered,

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I say something like-- because
my brain's been hijacked,

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.848 align:middle line:84%
I go, hey, nobody's flying
the plane right now.

00:33:59.848 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right back, OK?

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [CHUCKLES]

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:01.434 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: OK?

00:34:01.434 --> 00:34:03.434 align:middle line:84%
I'll just-- I've got to
go calm down, all right?

00:34:03.434 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And I come back, and I'm still--

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I know when I'm ready
to start to repair

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:90%
when I say something like this.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll go up, and I'll go,
so I accept your apology.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [CHUCKLES]

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Right?

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, just something that's
like-- but what-- and she and I

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.815 align:middle line:84%
both know that what I'm
trying to say is I'm sorry,

00:34:18.815 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still in my
ego a little too much.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:90%
But I'm trying to repair.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And then that's a
signal of safety to her

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:90%
to go, oh, OK, cool.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.114 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden we
can start to kind of calm

00:34:28.114 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
each other down from
that place, right?

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.909 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And the
thing about repair

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:84%
is, you can't judge
someone's repair process

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
and try, because they're
not going to get it right.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.866 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be able to, you
know, when someone's repairing,

00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:84%
do your best so when
you're ready to repair,

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.590 align:middle line:84%
then also kind of
extend that white flag.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's all
great if we have a Jenna,

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:84%
but what about when we don't
have that conscious partner

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.200 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.692 align:middle line:84%
Or a parent who has, still,
the triggering mechanisms,

00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:50.859 align:middle line:84%
and they're still operating
the old patterns totally

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and completely unaware of them?

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.681 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, well, I would just
say, don't go to a dry well.

00:34:55.681 --> 00:34:56.889 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] I know well full--

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:57.219 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have to sometimes.

00:34:57.219 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you live with
these people or work

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:90%
with these people.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, I
mean, maybe, but I

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
would want to
challenge that and get

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.962 align:middle line:90%
into why you think you have to.

00:35:04.962 --> 00:35:06.055 align:middle line:90%
You know, because--

00:35:06.055 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, what do you mean?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.375 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, that
usually speaks

00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to, like, obligation, which is
usually rooted in guilt, right?

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like, I
feel guilty if I don't.

>>KIPP: [CHUCKLES]

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.450 align:middle line:84%

look towards people,

and you probably answer
all of your comments.

00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Most of them, yeah.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Most of them.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:84%
My favorite ones answer to are
the ones that are the haters.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Those are the most-- those
are the best ones to talk to.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just confused
people who are actually

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
probably like you,
but they don't

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.915 align:middle line:90%
know why they don't like you.

00:41:29.915 --> 00:41:30.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
why they're engaging.

00:41:30.475 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:90%
They really want an answer.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
What type of hate?

>>KIPP: You know, during the
Dr. Ford, Kavanaugh stuff--

00:41:37.172 --> 00:41:38.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's not
about politics for me.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just the public is very
misguided about what trauma is.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was putting out a
lot of information about,

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
like, what trauma is and
why I believe her, and stuff

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
were, like, you

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:90%
know, disagreeing with that.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.217 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And I was educating them
on, like, well, actually here's

00:41:54.217 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:90%
the truth, you know?

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.485 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
guy was a Navy SEAL,

00:41:58.485 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and how do you engage
with a Navy SEAL?

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: He's like, you
don't understand trauma.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you're right.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand your trauma.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I need to
understand your trauma just

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:84%
like a doctor doesn't
need to know what it feels

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:84%
like to get a bullet in
their leg to pull one out

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:10.850 align:middle line:90%
of yours, right?

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't need to get shot
in the leg to know how to help,

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and what I know for sure is,
you know, this is what trauma.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.085 align:middle line:84%
And about three or four comments
later, he goes, well, you know,

00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:84%
there was a guy in my
platoon you helped out.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.860 align:middle line:84%
He says you're pretty
good, so I guess you're OK.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, or
something like that.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So that acknowledgment
of someone's experience

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is so important, too,
to be able to understand

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that these are passionate topics
that people are talking about.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.307 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
engage on social,

00:42:32.307 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:84%
too, because I talk about
things I care about.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not just some random
quote card that-- you know,

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
pulled a quote from the
internet or something.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%

stuff I really care about.

00:42:40.595 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

>>KIPP: Right, so that's
why I engage, too.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't stuff I cared
about, it wouldn't be there.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have to when
you're engaging at that level.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to be ready
for the controversy.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:90%
It has to happen.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Yeah, totally.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.082 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To think
it's not going to be

00:42:50.082 --> 00:42:52.130 align:middle line:90%
there is kind of ignorant.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So even when I'm
responding to a hater online,

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm responding
knowing that that's

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.025 align:middle line:90%
who's watching my responses.

00:42:59.025 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm responding for people
who are actually reading it.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Usually I'm not responding
to that person individually.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It's how I would want
my, quote, "base"

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.455 align:middle line:90%
to perceive my responses.

00:43:07.455 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:90%
That's how I respond.

>>LISA: Everyone is
entitled to an opinion,

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.850 align:middle line:84%

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.195 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Can they teach me to
have a different perspective?

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Can they teach me that maybe
I am a little bit too biased?

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they can
teach me their world

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:90%
and to have more compassion.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:90%

is that, you know,

00:43:32.513 --> 00:43:33.755 align:middle line:90%
mostly we want to be liked.

00:43:33.755 --> 00:43:34.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, this whole idea--

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: It's true.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know, so I mean, you
can put on the comment section

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.390 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It's hard to read
the comments where, you know,

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
people are saying, well, I
don't necessarily like that,

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.730 align:middle line:84%
or I don't agree with
her and her opinion.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.352 align:middle line:90%
But why do we need to be liked?

00:43:47.352 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Well, I think we're--

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, human beings are
social creatures, right?

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, the messaging
on kind of "un-", "un-", "un-",

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.900 align:middle line:84%
"un-" unconscious level
is, if I'm not liked,

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not part of the tribe.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not part of
the tribe, I'm vulnerable

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'm all by myself, and in
the wild, that makes me prey.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: The lion can eat me.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:90%

>>KIPP: But if I'm
with my people,

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And so it's that primal thing.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.120 align:middle line:90%

>>KIPP: [GASPS] Um, you've
got to find your tribe, right?

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So that you have your
family of origin,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
family you pick, right?

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Eventually.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Um, and the
thing is is that--

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's
the same family.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.255 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times-- and
Caroline talks about this.

00:44:24.255 --> 00:44:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Caroline Myss talks about this.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.755 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you embark
on a personal development

00:44:27.755 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
journey or a spiritual
journey or a healing journey,

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.485 align:middle line:84%
you know, that first
chakra, like tribal energy

00:44:32.485 --> 00:44:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is really powerful, and you
have to break free from that.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to leave the tribe.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.283 align:middle line:90%
Harry Potter did it.

00:44:37.283 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, every great, you know,
sort of story starts with that.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the hero's journey.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.928 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Right, so it's like--

00:44:41.928 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:84%
so you start with a
courageous choice,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.813 align:middle line:84%
and then you keep making
that choice consistently.

00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.292 align:middle line:84%
And if have a reason
to do it, that

00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:90%
makes it a little bit easier.

>>LISA: You don't waver.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.800 align:middle line:84%

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: It's hard.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It's super hard.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like-- and
you know, your family,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.570 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be there.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, they're
not going to believe you.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And later, they're
going to tell you,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I always knew you
could, and then

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
after that they're going
to ask you for money.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's how
it's going to go.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:45:04.885 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least you know
the game pretty much.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Right, yeah.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:90%
That's how it goes.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.187 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know the
rules, play by the rules.

00:45:10.187 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I love making
conscious media, which

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.505 align:middle line:84%
is what we're doing here
in an interactive process,

00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than just a passive
process of watching.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's great
for entertainment,

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.275 align:middle line:84%
but this is really interactive,
so there's a list that you have

00:45:21.275 --> 00:45:23.210 align:middle line:84%
here of a
what-am-I-missing-out-on list.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I encourage
people, get a journal,

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and make a list of these things.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the
purpose of this?

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to romance,
what am I missing out on?

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have
us write about that?

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.167 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, so the
idea is that, like,

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:84%
every behavior that we have,
there's something that we think

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.790 align:middle line:90%
is good about it.

secondary gain, yeah.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:84%

to become aware of,

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.678 align:middle line:90%
what's it costing you?

00:45:52.678 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
associate something that's

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.602 align:middle line:84%
usually joyful with,
like, some pain,

00:45:56.602 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:84%
then it starts to make
a lot more sense--

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.088 align:middle line:84%
it helps you loosen
your grasp on things

00:46:00.088 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and helps you realize,
well, you know what?

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe, you know, I
get a lot out of isolating

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.398 align:middle line:90%
myself and not going on dates.

Or maybe I get a lot out of

having to be right
in my relationship,

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.643 align:middle line:90%

00:46:13.393 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:90%
What am I missing out on?

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.940 align:middle line:84%
When you become aware of what
you're missing out on, too,

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.440 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you
start to realize

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.540 align:middle line:84%
that there's a price
you're paying to hold

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:90%
onto a certain behavior?

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.058 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really effective,
short, and powerful tool

00:46:25.058 --> 00:46:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to help you make quick behavior
change because behavior

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:90%

>>KIPP: So for example, maybe

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm single, and I
don't want love anymore

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:90%
because love's too hard right.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.403 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been single
for 15 years, all right?

00:46:41.403 --> 00:46:42.570 align:middle line:90%
What are you missing out on?

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You're missing out

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.320 align:middle line:90%
You're missing out on growth.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You're missing out on
healing, the past wounding,

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:84%

example of that, right,

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:84%
is people who get
stuck in their job,

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
start a business,

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.440 align:middle line:84%

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.960 align:middle line:84%
follow, like, Gary Vaynerchuk
on social media, right?

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.308 align:middle line:84%
Following Gary or me or who--
you, or whoever, doesn't

00:47:23.308 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:90%
make you an entrepreneur.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It just makes you
a follower, right?

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's the sidelines thing.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're in a job that
you don't love, but, you know,

it's paying the bills,

Right?

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why, when you see
the entrepreneurs who

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are most successful,
they're usually

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that sort of avoidant
category because they can put

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.550 align:middle line:90%
other people's opinions away.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do to get
out front on that is to say,

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.380 align:middle line:84%
to make it be
successful, is, I really

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.170 align:middle line:84%
care about what
people think, so who's

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:90%
going to be my support team?

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Who can reinforce that for me?

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it's probably not
going to be the people

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going
to be, but I can still

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.980 align:middle line:90%
find that support team.

yourself well enough

00:49:12.605 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:84%
to know what do I need
to be successful--

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:84%

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, when I had
my head injury,

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a team that was there,
and it's the same team.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And they-- when
production companies

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:84%
thought I was lying because
I forgot a lot of things

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I was saying, because I
had this horrible injury,

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.170 align:middle line:84%
they took over--
they're like, all right,

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.920 align:middle line:84%
let's just have these
phone calls for you,

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Lis, because right now
you're not in the right head.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: So good.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm like, I'm not?

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.745 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know I'm not.

00:50:37.745 --> 00:50:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's always
been support and people

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.045 align:middle line:90%
and connection and team.

00:50:43.045 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
That's always been
a huge thing for me.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.445 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: That's the--
and for the avoidants,

00:50:45.445 --> 00:50:46.520 align:middle line:90%
they're like, I don't need that.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like, well, how's it going?

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.100 align:middle line:84%
What are you missing out
on by not having a team?

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What is it costing you?

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.340 align:middle line:90%
What about health?

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.798 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a second.

00:50:53.798 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is it costing
you not to-- or I guess,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.650 align:middle line:84%
what is it costing you to eat
horribly or to eat that binge

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
thing, or to have that
comfort food, or--

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Totally.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.322 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's interesting, too--

00:51:06.322 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every case
is so individual,

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but a case comes to mind
of one of our clients

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.120 align:middle line:84%
who suffered from significant
chronic health issues.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And those were all real, OK?

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And-- there's a big "and"--

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.430 align:middle line:84%
on a very deep
level, she did not

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:84%
believe she could be loved
healthy, and so part of her

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.460 align:middle line:84%
wanted to stay
sick because that's

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.300 align:middle line:84%
how she thought her-- if she was
sick, her husband would stay.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Like, she knew it, but
she was terrified that if she

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.928 align:middle line:90%
got well that he wouldn't.

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was informed
by her history.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:84%
He's not a jerk, but her history
is, if I'm in this state,

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And so she has all the
functional doctors,

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:90%
and you know, that's amazing.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Functional medicine is amazing.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But when she realized
that she could

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:56.180 align:middle line:84%
love and be loved healthy,
all of her symptoms

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:90%
started to improve rapidly.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Which is interesting
data if you think about it.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Because it's that
interpersonal connection,

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.327 align:middle line:84%
So depending on circumstance,
you know, when you're--

00:52:08.327 --> 00:52:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the thing about chronic
illness, especially,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:90%
is it's very isolating, right?

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, what are
you missing out on by illness,

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:90%
not being healthy?

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:17.392 align:middle line:84%
It's so many different
things, right?

00:52:17.392 --> 00:52:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But usually, it some
version of closeness, right?

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, I was
going say freedom.

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.245 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, well, same
type of idea, right?

00:52:24.245 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Because it's emotional freedom.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way to
have emotional freedom.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't have it by yourself.

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, right.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Yeah, you
can't be an island.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just not how
it works, right?

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.686 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could be.

00:52:32.686 --> 00:52:33.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't we all?

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.670 align:middle line:90%
But we really can't!

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: I wish I

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I can't be an island.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:90%
I just can't.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.043 align:middle line:84%
I have, like, deal with

00:52:40.043 --> 00:52:41.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we
live in a busy city.

00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The tendency is to want
to just go to the island.

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Totally.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then you
get island fever.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.550 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.860 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you have to do it--
you can't do it all by yourself.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So, you
know, with health,

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.732 align:middle line:84%
it's-- you're missing out
on all kinds of stuff.

00:52:51.732 --> 00:52:52.330 align:middle line:90%
You're missing out on freedom.

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.663 align:middle line:90%
You're missing out on closeness.

00:52:53.663 --> 00:52:55.355 align:middle line:90%
But the other thing is, when--

00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:90%
depending on how bad it is.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a mom
who had a broken back.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.820 align:middle line:84%
She was in bed for the
first 10 years of my life.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.010 align:middle line:90%
She was completely immobilized.

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Right.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
her trauma history

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.760 align:middle line:84%
of, like, emotional
abuse by her mother,

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.837 align:middle line:84%
right, there's a part of her
that doesn't want to be seen.

00:53:11.837 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's terrifying,
as a five-year-old,

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to just have this terror
in the house, right?

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.600 align:middle line:90%
So yes, there's chronic pain.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Yes, she's had major
back surgeries.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's a medical
protocol for all that.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the underlying real issue
is that emotional disconnection.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at, like, chronic pain,

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.010 align:middle line:84%
it should be called
chronic trauma.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true, yeah.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: And a lot of
the opioids and stuff

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
like that just make those
pain pathways circle

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and become more, actually.

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And so, you know-- but there's--

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:40.777 align:middle line:84%
it's risky to be
close with somebody.

00:53:40.777 --> 00:53:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're vulnerable.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: It's risky to show
that part of yourself, right?

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's a lot of times why we
stay immobilized is because I

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.250 align:middle line:90%
don't want to go there.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not conscious.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.582 align:middle line:84%
It's all unconscious, and it's
informed from many years ago.

00:53:53.582 --> 00:53:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it
results and it shows

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.582 align:middle line:84%
up in things like health crises
and work crises and so forth.

00:53:57.582 --> 00:53:58.923 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:53:58.923 --> 00:54:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually, I want to
go back to that finance piece.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
finances you want,

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:90%
what are you missing out on?

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Well, all
kinds of stuff.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Usually, if you have the
finances that you want,

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.827 align:middle line:84%
it's because you're
treating money

00:54:10.827 --> 00:54:12.980 align:middle line:90%
like your parents treated you.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.703 align:middle line:84%
So you know, if you
never have enough,

00:54:15.703 --> 00:54:17.120 align:middle line:84%
usually you weren't
enough, right?

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we do what's been done
to us to others, essentially.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
opposite the golden rule.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So the golden rule
is, do unto others

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.490 align:middle line:84%
as you'd have them do
unto you, but really

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.390 align:middle line:84%
it's, I do unto others
as others did unto me.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.190 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of--

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're following the
money story of the family.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.367 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Well, not just that.

00:54:31.367 --> 00:54:33.932 align:middle line:84%
Like, so in
attachment theory, you

00:54:33.932 --> 00:54:35.390 align:middle line:84%
know, the first
physical attachment

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:37.010 align:middle line:90%
we have is our mother, right?

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Umbilical cord,
womb, all that stuff.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So how our mother treats us
with emotional attunement,

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:84%
physical proximity,
and what we learn

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:84%
we have to do to get that love
and approval and connection

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:51.150 align:middle line:84%
informs everything, certainly
the money story, for sure.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:90%
So if your mother--

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.757 align:middle line:84%
you know, if having
money was something

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is threatening to
your mother and that

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:84%
was an important connection
for you, you won't have it.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And when people realize having
money won't kill my mom, which

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:84%
sounds kind of
crazy consciously,

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:84%
but the unconscious
thinks so, that's

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.210 align:middle line:84%
when those breakthroughs
start to happen.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.585 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
never-- like, people

00:55:07.585 --> 00:55:09.800 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to earn
tremendous amounts of money.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:10.240 align:middle line:90%

they can because of those belief
systems, again, that trauma.

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: That's right.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:19.345 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting, too,
is Dr. Spock is responsible.

00:55:19.345 --> 00:55:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Because-- here's why.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [CHUCKLES]

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: Dr. Spock said
let them cry, right?

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at Bowlby's
work on attachment theory,

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.537 align:middle line:84%
when I cry out as a
kid, and I'm preverbal,

00:55:28.537 --> 00:55:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and you know my parents
are my higher power,

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and I have no power, right?

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm just immobilized.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.780 align:middle line:84%
When I cry out and
my needs aren't met,

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.572 align:middle line:84%
I get the message that
the universe doesn't

00:55:36.572 --> 00:55:39.220 align:middle line:84%
meet my needs, which eventually
turns into, I'm not worthy.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So worthiness comes
from childhood.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
If our needs were met when we
cried out and we weren't held

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't proximal
attention and attunement,

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that's where
unworthiness starts.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, it's
important to realize

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can cry out, and
your needs can get met.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why people have a hard
time with the law of attraction

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.230 align:middle line:84%
because they think the
universe is like their mom.

>>KIPP: It's all--
it is all parenting.

00:56:01.515 --> 00:56:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't cry it out.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask you,
what is your purpose?

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Your why?

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.725 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest
reason you do what you do?

00:56:10.725 --> 00:56:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KIPP: So on an
emotional level,

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.590 align:middle line:84%
my top two emotions that I love
to feel the most are excitement

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and curiosity.

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are my two
favorites, so I'm always

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.190 align:middle line:84%
searching for those
emotions in whatever I do.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:21.857 align:middle line:84%
So whatever makes me
excited and curious

00:56:21.857 --> 00:56:23.110 align:middle line:90%
is kind of where I'll go.

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.600 align:middle line:90%
But for now, that's manifested--

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- I mean, I would
like to get beyond this one,

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:90%
but this is a big one.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.552 align:middle line:84%
My moonshot is to end emotional
trauma in our lifetime.

00:56:31.552 --> 00:56:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I work on,
so anything that's lined up

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.740 align:middle line:90%
with that is what I'm doing.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'd like
it to be done tomorrow,

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.518 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably not, so
that's my thing for now.

00:56:40.518 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a good idea.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.643 align:middle line:90%
That's your thing for now.

00:56:42.643 --> 00:56:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll follow you on that.

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KIPP: Awesome.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of awareness
that you bring about.

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And you make it seem so easy.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, if this, then this.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.700 align:middle line:90%
If this, then this.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.500 align:middle line:90%
If this, then this.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You really have a way of
describing emotional trauma

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.823 align:middle line:84%
in a way that makes
so much sense.

00:56:57.823 --> 00:57:00.490 align:middle line:10%
>>KIPP: Well that makes me happy
because I do a lot of research.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
misunderstood topic,

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.320 align:middle line:10%
and I would like to try to
say that I make it simple.

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.270 align:middle line:10%
Because "easy"--

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: No, I agree.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KIPP: I'm not going
to say it's easy.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Easy to understand.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:10%
>>KIPP: Yeah, that's good.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.793 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, digestible.

00:57:11.793 --> 00:57:13.335 align:middle line:10%
You know, when I
work with scientists

00:57:13.335 --> 00:57:15.010 align:middle line:10%
and I try to unpack
the research,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:17.440 align:middle line:10%
I know I've hit the
truth when I try to say,

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.360 align:middle line:10%
so what you're saying
is basically this,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.977 align:middle line:10%
and it's something
basic, and they go, fine.

00:57:21.977 --> 00:57:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:24.893 align:middle line:84%
Because scientists like
to give the whole context,

00:57:24.893 --> 00:57:27.378 align:middle line:84%
right, answer that
includes everything.

00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I like to just take
the thing that's,

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.920 align:middle line:84%
like, going to help someone
do something with it

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and just really make
it actionable, applied.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.520 align:middle line:90%

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You have a genius there
of bringing that together

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.320 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.970 align:middle line:90%

And for helping us
really understand

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.210 align:middle line:10%
there's a deeper meaning
to the word "purpose."

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And that it's very-- it's
got a lot of texture to it.

>>KIPP: It does.

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.630 align:middle line:90%
