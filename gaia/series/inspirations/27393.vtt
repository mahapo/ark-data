00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.621 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Perhaps highest

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.156 align:middle line:10%
on our list of stressors,
aside from a life-threatening

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.626 align:middle line:10%
illness, is our
personal finances.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.662 align:middle line:10%
For this reason, I'm looking
at money from all directions.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.598 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, others are out
there creating solutions.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're speaking with
Michael Tellinger, who

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.737 align:middle line:10%
has a big plan for the people
of his native country, South

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:37.771 align:middle line:10%
Africa.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.475 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment there is
hovering around 40% to 50%

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.344 align:middle line:84%
with little hope of a
return to good times.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.214 align:middle line:84%
Michael's plan would bring
prosperity and dignity back

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.483 align:middle line:90%
to life in his homeland.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.752 align:middle line:90%
It's called Ubuntu.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.854 align:middle line:84%
And Michael, thank you
for joining us today.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.056 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject near and
dear to my heart as well.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.291 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: Oh yeah.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
stresses, and you've

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:84%
been putting a lot
of thought into this.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.396 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
I'd like for you

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.864 align:middle line:84%
to make the link between
your previous discoveries

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
in the books you've
written, which

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:84%
were about the inhabitation
of the South African lands

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.641 align:middle line:84%
by species from another planet
that created a worker bee

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.244 align:middle line:84%
species that became what
we know as the human being

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.146 align:middle line:90%
for the purposes of mining gold.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.948 align:middle line:84%
Now, we talked about
that at great length

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.316 align:middle line:90%
in another interview.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:25.519 align:middle line:84%
But how did that lead you
into the notion of Ubuntu?

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're really putting
yourself on the line

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.957 align:middle line:84%
because you're starting a new
political party in South Africa

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.191 align:middle line:90%
by the same name.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.125 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.494 align:middle line:10%
These things all
happen in a sequence

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.364 align:middle line:10%
of events that sometimes
take you by surprise.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.098 align:middle line:10%
And I was taken
by surprise when I

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.569 align:middle line:10%
started researching the
origins of humankind.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.037 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.472 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here as a species?

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.207 align:middle line:84%
And reaching
startling conclusions

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.676 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly are now becoming
more and more mainstream

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
theories and providing
the physical evidence

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and scientific evidence for
who we are as a species.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:10%
But what struck me
is when you start

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:02.055 align:middle line:10%
looking at the translations
of the Sumerian tablets

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.025 align:middle line:10%
and the work that
Zecharia Sitchin has done

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.995 align:middle line:10%
and pretty much all
other translations

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:14.034 align:middle line:10%
that are available, the concept
and the subject of money

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:18.839 align:middle line:10%
does not arise among
the so-called gods.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.909 align:middle line:84%
It only seems to appear
when humans enter the scene.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.913 align:middle line:84%
And it only seems to appear
when the control and the abuse

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.751 align:middle line:84%
of humanity is at
stake or at question.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that for
probably the first 280,000

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:39.893 align:middle line:84%
years of our existence as a
species, we did not have money.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.129 align:middle line:84%
We might have been a
lower consciousness level

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.167 align:middle line:84%
species as we were evolving into
the state that we're in now,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.004 align:middle line:84%
growing and exploding
in consciousness.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.074 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we didn't have money.

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And we survived for much
longer periods of time

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.647 align:middle line:84%
without the concept
of money than we

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:04.317 align:middle line:84%
have had the use of money
in our known history

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:90%
or our imagined history.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.425 align:middle line:84%
So the question begs, how
and why was money introduced?

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:16.063 align:middle line:84%
How and why is money
used by the human race?

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:18.965 align:middle line:84%
And the answers to that
are far more strange

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
than most people realize.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.237 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I mean, there
are certain theories out there

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.972 align:middle line:84%
and certain people's
works, in fact,

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:30.177 align:middle line:84%
that would even refer to
money almost as a virus that

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
has been injected into
our communal way of life,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.616 align:middle line:90%
our psyche, into our cultures.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.051 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It's
very clear to me

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.722 align:middle line:84%
now that the big separation,
the dividing line

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:46.493 align:middle line:84%
in pre-human history and the
sort of history that we would

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:50.831 align:middle line:84%
refer to today is the great
flood, the biblical flood.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.934 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a really
important dividing line

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.368 align:middle line:90%
in all of human history.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:58.438 align:middle line:84%
And it's only after
the flood, which

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:01.708 align:middle line:84%
happened between 12,000
and 13,000 years ago,--

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.944 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
be an historic event

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that most geologists and
historians and archaeologists

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.485 align:middle line:84%
tend to agree upon with
very little squabbling.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.221 align:middle line:84%
It's only after the flood
that this magical thing

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.724 align:middle line:84%
called money suddenly
pops its head up.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:24.798 align:middle line:10%
And it seems to coincide with
what Sumerian tablets refer

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:31.104 align:middle line:10%
to as, and it's a recurring
Sumerian tablet translation, is

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:10%
when kingdom was lowered
to earth from heaven.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:84%
And you find these translations
in several Sumerian tablets,

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:44.718 align:middle line:84%
when the gods appointed kings
on earth and high priests

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.853 align:middle line:90%
to rule over the people.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Part of that appointment,
after the flood,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.292 align:middle line:84%
was the introduction
of this thing called

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.629 align:middle line:84%
money that was then
used to control

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.032 align:middle line:84%
the humanity by the royal
bloodlines, which incidentally

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.433 align:middle line:90%
we still have today.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.968 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has changed.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.471 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is true,
and the manipulation

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
of the human species through
the monetary systems.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.843 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I told you
off camera about this,

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:11.845 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a man named
Stephen Belgin as well

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of money.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.516 align:middle line:84%
And what he was
talking about was

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:22.389 align:middle line:84%
how the local localities,
local companies, a coal mining

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.294 align:middle line:84%
company in one case, small towns
at various points in history,

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:30.997 align:middle line:84%
dating back about 1,000 years
ago and forward to this time,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.968 align:middle line:84%
were creative enough to be able,
in hard times, when currencies

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:38.071 align:middle line:84%
had gone down and people
had fallen into deprivation

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.975 align:middle line:84%
and even depression, they
were able to organize and find

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:46.379 align:middle line:84%
ways of pulling together and
very rapidly brang-- brought

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:84%
their community back up into
a high state of function

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.784 align:middle line:90%
again with prosperity.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.219 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
reason I bring it up

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.587 align:middle line:84%
is because of what
you just said.

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:57.224 align:middle line:84%
And then it would be
the king, who would--

00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.692 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Stamp
his authority.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --stamp his
authority and say, hey,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.729 align:middle line:84%
the monetary system
that exists currently,

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.097 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling
threatened by this.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:05.899 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
outlaw the use

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.934 align:middle line:84%
of whatever the
other complimentary

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.669 align:middle line:90%
form of trade or currency was.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.271 align:middle line:84%
And this has
happened repeatedly.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.038 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.875 align:middle line:84%
You know, the money thing is
a really fascinating subject

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:21.748 align:middle line:84%
to talk about because we are so
lost and consumed with money.

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:24.451 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine a
world without money.

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:26.987 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
find so fascinating.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:29.889 align:middle line:84%
Is if you allow
yourself the freedom

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.859 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a world without money
and how it will dramatically

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:36.296 align:middle line:84%
change everything we do,
the way we think, the way we

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:38.798 align:middle line:84%
behave towards each
other, the way we act,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
what we choose to do in our
lives, how we build things,

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:44.437 align:middle line:84%
how we live, how we
educate, how we heal,

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:48.875 align:middle line:84%
how we use energy--
it affects everything

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.177 align:middle line:90%
dramatically and profoundly.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.647 align:middle line:84%
It takes the entire
social structure

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:57.984 align:middle line:84%
as we have as a species
and turns it on its head.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, I
need to, as I normally

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.492 align:middle line:84%
do in my presentations, say how
did we get into this situation?

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:09.863 align:middle line:84%
How did we get into this
mess that we face today?

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:14.701 align:middle line:84%
Global economic collapse
is looming, is imminent.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:20.473 align:middle line:84%
Most, sort of,
levelheaded economists

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:84%
are startled at the
fact that there is still

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.112 align:middle line:84%
a global economy, that it hasn't
just collapsed or imploded

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.049 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: How is
it still continuing?

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:32.485 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the answer to
that is relatively simple.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:36.089 align:middle line:84%
It's because the power that the
banking families and the royal

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:39.259 align:middle line:84%
bloodlines that go back
thousands of years.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.727 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that happened

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.595 align:middle line:90%
100 years ago or 200 years ago.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.597 align:middle line:84%
This goes back
thousands of years

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
of control and manipulation
of the human race.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And money, at one point,
became the key tool

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.606 align:middle line:90%
of control, absolute control.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:56.476 align:middle line:84%
And they're so powerful
that they can really

00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
keep it propped up for
as long as they possibly

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.185 align:middle line:84%
can until we, the people,
decide that's enough.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
at the same time,

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:09.789 align:middle line:84%
they keep it propped
up, yet scarce.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:10.824 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Very scarce.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Scarcity seems to
be really at the basis of this

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:18.765 align:middle line:84%
because if you can't create a
fear of some kind surrounding

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:21.935 align:middle line:84%
any given subject, especially
money, which relates

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:24.037 align:middle line:84%
to our survival, our
sense of survival.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:27.907 align:middle line:84%
If you can't create fear--
Scarcity equals fear.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:30.677 align:middle line:84%
If you can't create fear,
you can't control people.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.413 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Well, that's
what you opened up by saying,

00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest stressors
we have is financial stress.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.118 align:middle line:84%
Well, why do we have
financial stress?

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.885 align:middle line:90%
Why do we allow ourselves?

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.821 align:middle line:90%
How do we get to this point?

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.222 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beautiful story.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:84%
When the lights go on and
you realize what's going on,

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
you go, how could I have
been so stupid to buy

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.065 align:middle line:90%
into that kind of system?

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.768 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an absolute
control and manipulation

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:58.505 align:middle line:84%
system, where a small number
of humans, individuals,

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.307 align:middle line:84%
have taken on the
right to print money

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:04.444 align:middle line:84%
and to create money out of
thin air, out of nothing

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:07.247 align:middle line:84%
and make us, the
rest of humanity,

00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:90%
use that thing that they create.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:12.085 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't have it,
oh, you're in big trouble.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.219 align:middle line:90%
You're in big, big trouble.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.254 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any money?

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.054 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.656 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going
to become a vagrant.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.391 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
become a criminal.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.494 align:middle line:84%
From the moment we breathe
our first breath when

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:24.264 align:middle line:84%
we are born to the moment
we breathe our last breath,

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:25.865 align:middle line:90%
it's all about money.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:30.136 align:middle line:84%
And people that deny that
are just fooling themselves

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.305 align:middle line:84%
until they wake
up and realize it.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.673 align:middle line:90%
We can do something about it.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:36.075 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to do
something about that.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle line:90%
And I think the time has come.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has come.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.046 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're doing
something that's

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:42.048 align:middle line:84%
really fascinating, which
we're going to get to.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.118 align:middle line:84%
Other people have actually
tried creating new currencies

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.786 align:middle line:90%
and introducing new currencies.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.521 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
ended up in jail,

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:49.956 align:middle line:90%
as a result of their efforts.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.492 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
create a new currency.

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.327 align:middle line:84%
There are very
specific protocols.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:57.464 align:middle line:84%
Certain communities in the
United States, for example,

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:01.534 align:middle line:84%
have successfully created
an alternative currency.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:04.771 align:middle line:84%
But still, you're getting
into very problematic areas.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.808 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking
about does not necessarily

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.477 align:middle line:90%
involve currencies.

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:11.344 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: No.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:14.581 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting something
completely the opposite.

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
If money is the
tool of all problems

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.186 align:middle line:84%
and the tool of
absolute control, which

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:23.389 align:middle line:84%
we can show very quickly
that that's what it is,

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:28.862 align:middle line:84%
then how do we escape
that absolute control?

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.264 align:middle line:84%
By removing money
from the system.

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:34.267 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that to people,
most people jump up and down

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:90%
and go, how is it going to work?

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.103 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to pay for things?

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:39.105 align:middle line:84%
Why should I do this or
why should I do that?

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.074 align:middle line:84%
If there's no money,
what incentive is there?

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle line:90%
You know, people are lazy.

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to do anything.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.379 align:middle line:84%
All those arguments
and notions are

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
based on the capitalistic
and consumeristic principles

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.086 align:middle line:90%
that we have been brought up on.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.522 align:middle line:84%
We cannot imagine a world
without money where people

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:59.626 align:middle line:84%
actually live out their lives
using the God-given talents

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:02.529 align:middle line:84%
or they acquired
skills that they--

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.098 align:middle line:84%
passions that they pursued
because of what it is they love

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:09.435 align:middle line:84%
to do, and using that as their
contribution to their society.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.771 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us
to the key word here.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:16.142 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, it is an age old
tradition known as Ubuntu.

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:20.013 align:middle line:10%
And I call it contributionism,
which is something

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.181 align:middle line:10%
that I deduced out
of writing my book,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.984 align:middle line:10%
"Slave Species of God,"
realizing that money was

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:10%
maliciously introduced
to the human race

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.123 align:middle line:10%
as a tool of control,
and the way we overcome

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:33.626 align:middle line:10%
that is the way that people
lived for hundreds of thousands

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:36.429 align:middle line:10%
of years, without money.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.964 align:middle line:84%
How do people live
without money?

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:40.099 align:middle line:84%
By contributing
towards the greater

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:90%
good of their communities.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the African version of that.

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle line:90%
What is the spirit of Ubuntu?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.574 align:middle line:84%
And how has that been
employed in Africa?

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.475 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Well, it's
an age old tradition,

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.045 align:middle line:84%
not just in Africa, but
at all native populations

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.379 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:58.718 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to have
the same human motive.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.922 align:middle line:84%
And that is if it's not good for
everyone, it's no good at all.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:07.226 align:middle line:84%
And that's a beautiful,
simplistic point of view.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.263 align:middle line:10%
What I need to remind
your viewers of

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:10%
is that when the colonialists
arrived in Africa,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.668 align:middle line:10%
there was no homelessness.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.337 align:middle line:90%
There was no hunger.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.505 align:middle line:90%
There was no unemployment.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.709 align:middle line:84%
There were tribes living
in absolute abundance.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.845 align:middle line:84%
And if the tribe went hungry,
then everybody went hungry.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:30.516 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have homeless people
within the tribes wandering

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.486 align:middle line:90%
It was a controlled system.

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.722 align:middle line:84%
And Ubuntu is at the
foundation of this.

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient
African tradition.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.994 align:middle line:84%
But all native populations
have those same traditions.

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:45.965 align:middle line:84%
It is the colonization that
started some 500 years ago

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:84%
that, as we discussed in
the previous interview,

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.404 align:middle line:90%
severed us from our ancestors.

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:55.174 align:middle line:84%
And the atrocities that
the colonizers perpetrated

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.677 align:middle line:84%
in all the different
parts of the world, that

00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:01.014 align:middle line:84%
severed the native people
from their ancestors,

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:03.683 align:middle line:84%
brought in so-called
civilization

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:06.919 align:middle line:84%
and bring in modernization
and technology.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.688 align:middle line:90%
They introduced money.

00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:13.326 align:middle line:84%
They introduced ownership
of land and things

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:15.895 align:middle line:84%
that were really quite alien
because the ancient cultures

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:84%
believed that the land
belonged to the divine.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We were just
inhabiting the land,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to use
the land with respect.

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.405 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of the
fundamental principles

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:28.941 align:middle line:84%
that I'm bringing back
through the philosophies

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:84%
that I've been putting
together since 2005,

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.846 align:middle line:84%
called contributionism
or Ubuntu.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:10%
And I really call it
Ubuntu contributionism

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.587 align:middle line:10%
because it's a subtle twist on
the original Ubuntu principles

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:43.956 align:middle line:10%
because we need to
keep moving forward

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:47.093 align:middle line:10%
by utilizing the
best of the past.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we get
into the mechanics of that--

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:84%
And we have a huge discussion
ahead about education

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle line:84%
because we really have to
start over as a species,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:59.505 align:middle line:84%
in terms of raising each
other, raising our children.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.575 align:middle line:84%
Where we are, as a result
of the Industrial Revolution

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:05.645 align:middle line:84%
and technology, I'm sure that
there are many people listening

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:08.748 align:middle line:84%
to this right now
thinking, but I

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
don't want to just
live close to the land.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.785 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
without my stuff

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.855 align:middle line:84%
because we've learned to
acquire and desire stuff.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.623 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: We consume,
consume, consume.

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.826 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We cannot remember
what it was like to live

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:21.894 align:middle line:84%
simply, where you have
shorter work days,

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.896 align:middle line:84%
where you're with your
family, where you're with

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:27.333 align:middle line:84%
your children, where
you help each other out.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.969 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does that part factor
in when you discuss this?

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.537 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has to
be a consideration

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.338 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of people.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:90%
But I want my iPhone.

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.075 align:middle line:90%
And so how does that--

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.611 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I think these are
very important considerations.

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:42.815 align:middle line:84%
And we've compiled a set
of questions that I ask.

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:45.451 align:middle line:84%
I've been through this thousands
and thousands of times.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe we
can get to those at the end.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.489 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: But I
think, just to put people

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:84%
at ease, whatever you're
thinking right now, I virtually

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.595 align:middle line:84%
can guarantee you I've
been asked those questions

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:56.963 align:middle line:90%
thousands of times.

00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:59.799 align:middle line:84%
The answers to every possible
hurdle you might have come up

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
with in our capitalistic,
consumeristic perspective

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.672 align:middle line:84%
is like, what's in it
for me, me, me, me.

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.508 align:middle line:84%
I've answered most
of those questions.

00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
What I've had to do is
look at society today.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.044 align:middle line:90%
What is it that we do?

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.379 align:middle line:90%
How do we function?

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.715 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked at all the
different areas of society,

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.451 align:middle line:84%
whether it's education,
whether it's arts and culture,

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:24.056 align:middle line:84%
whether it's science and
technology, whether it's food,

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:27.527 align:middle line:84%
providing of food and
community, all those areas I've

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:29.996 align:middle line:84%
had to look at and
figure out solutions.

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
How is this going to work
in a moneyless society?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.935 align:middle line:84%
Which it worked for
long periods of time.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But now, if we had to remove
money from the system,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.605 align:middle line:90%
how is it going to work?

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:44.343 align:middle line:84%
And the answers are so
simple, so incredibly simple,

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:48.414 align:middle line:84%
that when it hits you
is the most exciting,

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:51.484 align:middle line:84%
mind-blowing moment
in your life,

00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that you'll remember that
moment forever and ever.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.189 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
huge concrete block

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:58.191 align:middle line:84%
that's being lifted
off your chest when

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:00.226 align:middle line:84%
you realize how
simple it all is.

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:01.327 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, what a tease.

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:04.096 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And how
poisoned our minds

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:08.634 align:middle line:84%
have become through the system
of capitalism and acquiring

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.602 align:middle line:90%
of stuff.

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, we just
die and leave it behind.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
to that stuff?

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.809 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is going to
acquire it from us and--

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, not
just stuff but stature.

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:22.381 align:middle line:84%
It has come down
to that, really.

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:25.017 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we're looking at
how we educate our children,

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:84%
for example, which we'll be
getting into, a lot of it

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.655 align:middle line:90%
is, oh, you must go to college.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:90%
You must have a college--

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.892 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're starting to
see the failings in that.

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:36.963 align:middle line:84%
We have hundreds of thousands
of college graduates who

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:39.632 align:middle line:84%
are vying for jobs in
the service industry

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:42.268 align:middle line:84%
to get a job as a
waiter or a busser

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:43.436 align:middle line:90%
at a restaurant or anything.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.104 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It's all
smoke and mirrors.

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.272 align:middle line:90%
It's all deception.

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:48.341 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet we all
fell into this trap

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.143 align:middle line:84%
because somehow to
have any status in life

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.879 align:middle line:84%
where you could
acquire what you wanted

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:56.716 align:middle line:84%
or position yourself or have
freedom, latitude, freedom

00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:59.285 align:middle line:84%
of movement even,
required a certain income.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.754 align:middle line:84%
A certain income required a
certain level of education.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:04.757 align:middle line:84%
And it started really infecting
the thinking all the way up

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:07.894 align:middle line:84%
the chain to where you're not
making any organically sound

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:08.728 align:middle line:90%
decisions anymore.

00:17:08.728 --> 00:17:10.596 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It's the
hierarchical structure.

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:90%
It's the hierarchical pyramid.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, in
hierarchical pyramid,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.969 align:middle line:84%
there's only one person
who can be at the top.

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.471 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
people are going

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.406 align:middle line:84%
to have to work for that
one person at the top

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:21.406 align:middle line:90%
and grovel their way up.

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:23.675 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's always going
to try and push the one guy

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.478 align:middle line:84%
off the top so they
can be at the top.

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:29.015 align:middle line:84%
So let's just quickly examine
the fundamentals of this

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:30.016 align:middle line:90%
because it's important.

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.384 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
say, well, what

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.518 align:middle line:90%
are you guys talking about?

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.953 align:middle line:90%
You're going around and around.

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:36.389 align:middle line:84%
Well, why are we
in this position?

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:84%
Why are we in this horribly
confusing state of our species

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:46.532 align:middle line:84%
that most people
hate their lives?

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:47.733 align:middle line:90%
Most people hate their lives.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:48.467 align:middle line:90%
They hate their jobs.

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.268 align:middle line:90%
They hate their boss.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.736 align:middle line:84%
They hate waking
up in the morning,

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.706 align:middle line:84%
catching a train or a plane, or
riding a bicycle in the rain,

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.641 align:middle line:90%
in the snow, having to drive.

00:17:55.641 --> 00:18:00.513 align:middle line:84%
And then in third world
countries, it's harsh.

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:84%
But everybody has their
own personal misery

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.284 align:middle line:90%
that they have to deal with.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.954 align:middle line:84%
They are not doing
what they believe

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:09.689 align:middle line:90%
their natural talents are.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.324 align:middle line:84%
They're not sharing
the energy that

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:13.559 align:middle line:84%
comes from within with
the rest of the world.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:17.063 align:middle line:84%
They're doing something
else that they hate to do

00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:20.232 align:middle line:84%
and they're forced to do to
earn a few lousy bucks so

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.568 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the month they
can buy some bread and milk

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:25.171 align:middle line:84%
and pay for the electricity
that should be free.

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:26.739 align:middle line:84%
But we're paying
through our noses

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:29.508 align:middle line:84%
to get electricity and send
the children to school.

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.445 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're going
to struggle through life.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.481 align:middle line:84%
So it's this never-ending
cycle of chasing your tail

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:39.218 align:middle line:84%
to earn a few bucks so
you can live and survive.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.687 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that happening?

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.194 align:middle line:84%
Every socio-political system
we've had as a species

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:49.528 align:middle line:90%
has failed us.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It's failed us for
specific reasons.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.199 align:middle line:84%
We probably don't have
enough time to go into--

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.633 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go into all of
them or any of them really.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:55.468 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: --that.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.302 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.105 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
capitalism, communism,

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:00.906 align:middle line:90%
socialism, fascism.

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:03.042 align:middle line:90%
You call it whatever you want.

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.977 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
people get confused

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.846 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about
contributionism.

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.314 align:middle line:90%
It's another ism.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.616 align:middle line:84%
I don't really like the
fact that it's an ism.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:14.453 align:middle line:84%
But it's a nice ism because
it's completely and utterly

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.423 align:middle line:84%
different from every
other ism we've had,

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:19.892 align:middle line:84%
because every other ism
we've had as a species

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
was always based on
one thing, money.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.834 align:middle line:84%
Contributionism is a system
that works without money.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamentals
are really simple.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.239 align:middle line:84%
Some people still
believe that money

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:35.941 align:middle line:84%
is a consequence of
natural evolution,

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.278 align:middle line:84%
that we had barter and
trade, and then they

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:84%
became promissory notes, and
then they became minted coins.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.183 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.317 align:middle line:90%
That's the lie.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.621 align:middle line:84%
And those are the deceptions
that we've been told and taught

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
so that we think it's
OK to have money.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it's not
OK to have money.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't need money.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.462 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:90%
People do everything.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.498 align:middle line:90%
People plant the seeds.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.866 align:middle line:90%
People grow the food.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.602 align:middle line:84%
People solve the
mathematical solutions.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.438 align:middle line:90%
People look after babies.

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
People develop the rockets
and the technology.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.575 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.412 align:middle line:84%
Money is the hurdle between
abundance and success

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:17.283 align:middle line:90%
on all levels or failure.

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:20.119 align:middle line:84%
So if we want
success in abundance

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:22.354 align:middle line:84%
and have as much food and
abundance on all level,

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:25.558 align:middle line:84%
whether it's food or
technology or rocket science

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:29.261 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is your
mind can conjure up,

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.097 align:middle line:84%
the moment you remove
money from the system,

00:20:31.097 --> 00:20:34.033 align:middle line:84%
you open the floodgates
to absolute abundance

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:34.834 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And essentially,
as soon as you

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.405 align:middle line:84%
do that, a feeling
of equality starts

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.207 align:middle line:84%
happening within the
hearts of individuals.

00:20:41.207 --> 00:20:42.475 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: And so it should.

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:44.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and it
should, absolutely.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:45.411 align:middle line:90%
That's our natural state.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.513 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: We're all

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:49.949 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a millisecond
we're all equal.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:50.883 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:53.786 align:middle line:84%
And then that inequality
starts, and it just

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:55.821 align:middle line:84%
gets worse and
worse until you die.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.756 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
all equal but different.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:02.027 align:middle line:84%
But you put a room of people
together, say example, men--

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.629 align:middle line:84%
You put a room full
of men together.

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.832 align:middle line:84%
You have someone who is
maybe earning half a million,

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:09.068 align:middle line:84%
a million dollars
a year, someone

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
who owns their own
corporation, someone

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.806 align:middle line:84%
else who is a heavyweight
in some sector.

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:16.675 align:middle line:84%
And then you have someone
who maybe is struggling

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:19.245 align:middle line:84%
to make ends meet,
and they're concerned

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:21.747 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to have a
job next year for their family.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:25.217 align:middle line:84%
And on and on and on, you go
around this room of individuals

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:29.021 align:middle line:84%
with a diverse kinds of
economic portfolios, as it were.

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.423 align:middle line:84%
You can tell exactly

our culture is

00:21:45.004 --> 00:21:48.073 align:middle line:84%
Look, unfortunately,
this is the situation.

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:49.241 align:middle line:90%
No matter how you argue it.

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.044 align:middle line:84%
You can argue in favor
of money, that it's

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:54.079 align:middle line:90%
an exchange of energy.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:54.947 align:middle line:90%
And it's not money.

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:57.116 align:middle line:84%
It's the love of money
that causes the problems.

00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:59.251 align:middle line:84%
You know what, I've been
through this thousands

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of times.

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:02.721 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no on every level.

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It is money that is the problem.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.459 align:middle line:84%
It's the money that
causes all the problems,

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:11.263 align:middle line:84%
money that's responsible for
the gluttony and the greed

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:14.266 align:middle line:84%
and the hoarding and the
ugliness and the seven

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.267 align:middle line:90%
deadly sins.

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:16.368 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Competition.

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.403 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Competition.

00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:19.171 align:middle line:84%
The hierarchial
structure system.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:90%
So let's get to the good news.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.944 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that you
can solve all these problems,

00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:27.746 align:middle line:84%
because we can harp
on the negative,

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:30.583 align:middle line:84%
but let's provide your
viewers with a solution.

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:32.418 align:middle line:84%
And the solution
is really simple.

00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:34.453 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of money.

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:37.356 align:middle line:84%
As horrific as it may seem
for the next few seconds

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.392 align:middle line:84%
or few minutes or few
weeks for some people--

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:42.094 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
get it instantly.

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.829 align:middle line:84%
Some people take a
little while to get it.

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.531 align:middle line:84%
And some people really
struggle with it

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:50.402 align:middle line:84%
because they really grounded in
the capitalistic, consumeristic

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:53.072 align:middle line:84%
society that we've
become of me, me, me.

00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:53.906 align:middle line:90%
What's in it for me?

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we need
a make believe world

00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:57.543 align:middle line:84%
that we're creating
verbally right now,

00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:90%
a world without money.

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.081 align:middle line:84%
You can be safe because, for the
moment, it's just theoretical.

00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.515 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It's
just theoretical.

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.285 align:middle line:84%
But allow yourself to expand
your mind and think about this.

00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:10.189 align:middle line:84%
And remember that quantum
physics and the metaphysics

00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:12.758 align:middle line:84%
and the beautiful
beings of light

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.694 align:middle line:84%
out there teaching us that
we can manifest things

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:18.464 align:middle line:84%
with our mind, the laws of
attraction, all these things.

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:23.235 align:middle line:84%
So if we project a beautiful
world of unity consciousness,

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:26.872 align:middle line:84%
where everybody shares and
everybody contributes what

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:30.242 align:middle line:84%
their passion is towards their
society and their community,

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:34.179 align:middle line:84%
there'll be an abundance of
all for everyone at all times.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:37.416 align:middle line:84%
That is really the
utopian structure of this.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.451 align:middle line:84%
And I also just need to
just throw this in there,

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
because some people,
as we said earlier,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.822 align:middle line:84%
believe that money is the
consequence of barter and trade

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:45.724 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:50.529 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the
contributionist Ubuntu system

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:54.967 align:middle line:84%
has no barter, no trade, no
value attached to anything,

00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:59.038 align:middle line:84%
greater or lesser, because
in the Ubuntu communities

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:90%
everyone is equally valued.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.675 align:middle line:84%
Your time and your
effort and energy,

00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
what you do for
your community is

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.879 align:middle line:90%
valued as much as anybody else.

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is a
really important part.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:12.751 align:middle line:84%
Every person and with the skill
that they bring to the table

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:16.922 align:middle line:84%
is an important part
of an entire system.

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:20.359 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: So in a nutshell,
the definition of an Ubuntu

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:23.729 align:middle line:84%
contributionist society that
functions without money--

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.497 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
get into how we're

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
going to get there because
that's always a big question.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.235 align:middle line:84%
--the fundamental
structures are--

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:33.005 align:middle line:84%
And if you need
to, if you come up

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:84%
against problems in your mind,
how are we going to do this?

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:36.575 align:middle line:90%
How is that going to work?

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:37.643 align:middle line:90%
How is that going to work?

00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:41.947 align:middle line:84%
Just repeat the mantra, the
five-pointed mantra, right,

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.615 align:middle line:90%
the five-factor mantra.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
--no money, no barter,
no trade, no value

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.056 align:middle line:84%
attached to anything
greater or lesser

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
than anyone else's value,
where everybody contributes

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
their natural talents, God-given
skills, God-given talents

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.766 align:middle line:84%
or acquired skills
for the greater

00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:03.369 align:middle line:84%
benefit of all in
their community.

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Those are the five points.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.271 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
going to be doing this.

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:09.007 align:middle line:84%
You're looking to do this
as a model in your hometown,

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:09.908 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:11.543 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take a short break.

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.145 align:middle line:84%
But when we get
back, I want to know

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:15.247 align:middle line:84%
exactly what this looks
like functionally.

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.048 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Great.

00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:17.316 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll be right back.

00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:19.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:20.219 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And we left off at
a really juicy place

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.323 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to be
talking about what that looks

00:25:24.323 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:90%
like in a real functional model.

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.594 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something you
want to bring to your hometown,

00:25:28.594 --> 00:25:32.898 align:middle line:84%
which I cannot pronounce
in South Africa.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
And so let's begin.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.502 align:middle line:84%
This is a small town
with natural resources.

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:37.403 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:38.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basic
natural resources,

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:40.539 align:middle line:84%
not extraordinary
natural resources.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:40.773 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: No.

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:90%
Basic natural resources.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:47.179 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's also important
to recognize that this is not

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:51.316 align:middle line:10%
going to be a smooth
transition from a capitalistic,

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:54.553 align:middle line:10%
consumeristic society
way of thinking to living

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.755 align:middle line:10%
without money in
abundance for all.

00:25:56.755 --> 00:26:01.226 align:middle line:84%
But abundance for all
is where we're heading,

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:04.997 align:middle line:84%
and that is, for me, the
beautiful image that I've

00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
absolutely, permanently
imprinted in my mind

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.969 align:middle line:84%
are these communities that
just function seamlessly

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:15.307 align:middle line:84%
and effortlessly, developing
everything and anything

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:19.511 align:middle line:84%
that that community needs
because that's what they do.

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your community.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.682 align:middle line:90%
What does your community have?

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:24.783 align:middle line:90%
How would this start?

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:26.819 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Well, I
think every little town

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:28.754 align:middle line:90%
can use this as a little model.

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a small
town or a small village,

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
you've got to start with the
basic necessities: food, water,

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
housing, shelter, health care,
education-- the fundamentals

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.837 align:middle line:84%
that every society
and community needs.

00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:47.139 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with the food.

00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:49.374 align:middle line:84%
The food and water is
the most important thing.

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:55.113 align:middle line:84%
So farmers will play a key
role in the transition phase

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:58.584 align:middle line:84%
into moneyless societies
because once a community's got

00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:02.421 align:middle line:84%
enough food and
water, they can start

00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:03.722 align:middle line:90%
thinking about everything else.

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.457 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
worry about, where

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
am I going to earn enough
money to buy some food?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.527 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.329 align:middle line:84%
You have your basic
survival needs.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:12.397 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And if the
community looks after each

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:15.934 align:middle line:84%
other with food, and you
have the people within that

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:19.104 align:middle line:84%
community that are really the
good cooks and the chefs--

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:90%
I'm really simplifying it now.

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:23.709 align:middle line:10%
--that provide the food,
that cook the food so

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:25.477 align:middle line:10%
that the whole
community can eat,

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:29.214 align:middle line:10%
and now you've got some
serious solutions to,

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:30.616 align:middle line:10%
especially in
Africa, where you've

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:33.886 align:middle line:10%
got a lot of homelessness, a
lot of hunger because there's

00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:38.924 align:middle line:10%
no jobs, and people spend all
their time and energy to earn

00:27:38.924 --> 00:27:41.627 align:middle line:10%
a few bucks,
whether it's begging

00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:44.463 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's coming to
you for a job every day

00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:47.299 align:middle line:10%
so they can earn a
few rands or dollars

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:10%
so they can go buy some food.

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:53.372 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they spend that time on
community projects, developing

00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:56.074 align:middle line:84%
food, everybody can have
food in that community.

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's backtrack a little bit.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.179 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing that
these communities need to do,

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:84%
the small towns,
is start working

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
with the farmers
around the areas,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.755 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's growing food
or dairy farms or chickens

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:13.825 align:middle line:84%
and eggs, and then
extending that into things

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:17.329 align:middle line:84%
like converting the sewage
plants into free energy,

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:20.399 align:middle line:84%
methane gas, and
using the rivers

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:22.834 align:middle line:84%
and solar to generate
energy so you

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:26.371 align:middle line:84%
can get the town or the
village off the grid.

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.407 align:middle line:84%
Once you don't have
to pay electricity

00:28:28.407 --> 00:28:30.342 align:middle line:84%
for the electricity
providing companies

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:32.177 align:middle line:84%
and you supply
yourself with energy,

00:28:32.177 --> 00:28:36.148 align:middle line:84%
you've got enough milk,
bread, butter, cheese, eggs.

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:38.717 align:middle line:84%
You've got gas coming
from the sewage plant.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.653 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you're looking at
a whole different community.

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.221 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly there's more time.

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's getting fed.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.094 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's got the
basic necessities.

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:52.731 align:middle line:84%
And you start using the natural
resources as well for building

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:57.436 align:middle line:84%
materials, and using
natural building techniques

00:28:57.436 --> 00:29:00.138 align:middle line:84%
to build houses that are
far more eco-friendly.

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:02.007 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More
insulated for example.

00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:02.708 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.843 align:middle line:84%
You look at houses that
are 2,000 years old

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:07.546 align:middle line:84%
built in the Near East,
and they're standing.

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:10.282 align:middle line:84%
You look at a house that's 100
years old standing around here,

00:29:10.282 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:90%
they're broken down.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes
a fire all around.

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:17.222 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And so
imagine if you've

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.424 align:middle line:84%
got this little community
that get together.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.526 align:middle line:84%
They decide, right, this
is what we're going to do.

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
after ourselves

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:27.265 align:middle line:84%
in all these obvious areas--
energy, food, water, shelter,

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.068 align:middle line:84%
housing-- and then
use that as a base

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:35.207 align:middle line:90%
to expand that to other areas.

00:29:35.207 --> 00:29:37.542 align:middle line:84%
So very shortly, you're going
to have a community that's

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:41.747 align:middle line:84%
going to be living virtually
free because they're paying

00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:43.548 align:middle line:84%
very little for energy
and electricity.--

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're using
their natural resources.

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:46.184 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They've got bread
and milk and butter

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.089 align:middle line:84%
that they make available for all
the people in their community

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:53.592 align:middle line:84%
because they're
contributing to making it.

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:57.396 align:middle line:84%
And you know how much you can
make, how much milk and stuff

00:29:57.396 --> 00:29:59.097 align:middle line:84%
you can generate with
very little effort

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.832 align:middle line:90%
if you really apply yourself.

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:04.002 align:middle line:84%
So now, suddenly everyone's got
everything in that community.

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:05.771 align:middle line:84%
What's the next
step that happens.

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.573 align:middle line:84%
The next step is now, OK,
you've got too much stuff,

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:11.143 align:middle line:84%
because that's what happens
when you do what you love to do

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.778 align:middle line:84%
and if you're looking
after each other.

00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:13.845 align:middle line:90%
You've got too much stuff.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.647 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
start making the stuff

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:19.217 align:middle line:84%
available to the
communities around you

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:21.253 align:middle line:84%
at a fraction of the
price that they're

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.588 align:middle line:90%
buying it at the supermarket.

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:24.956 align:middle line:84%
So all the
communities around you

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:27.459 align:middle line:84%
are going to start coming to
you to buy their milk and bread

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:29.728 align:middle line:90%
and butter and all the stuff.

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:33.065 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen to
their own communities is

00:30:33.065 --> 00:30:34.466 align:middle line:90%
they're going to say, hold on.

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:36.702 align:middle line:84%
We can't survive doing
the business the way

00:30:36.702 --> 00:30:39.404 align:middle line:84%
we used to because all
the people from our town

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
are getting their stuff
from the neighboring town.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to force them
to take on the same model

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.779 align:middle line:84%
and looking after each
other so they can also

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.382 align:middle line:84%
live virtually free
and creating abundance

00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:52.651 align:middle line:90%
of the basic necessities.

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:56.688 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got the people that
have got all this extra time.

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.691 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can start looking
at beautifying the town

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and building free energy
devices and developing

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.801 align:middle line:84%
the civil engineering, solving
solutions with sewage problems

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:14.439 align:middle line:84%
and developing arts and
recreational facilities.

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:17.476 align:middle line:84%
And that's the spark that
gets this thing going

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:19.945 align:middle line:90%
to every level of society.

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:22.314 align:middle line:84%
Shoemakers are making
beautiful shoes.

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:24.449 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly everybody
wants to come and get

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:90%
the shoes from this guy.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.085 align:middle line:84%
And where does he
get the leather from?

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.221 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the guys that
are running the farms that

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:33.225 align:middle line:84%
providing the meat and the
cows and all that stuff.

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:37.262 align:middle line:84%
So you start seeing how this
integrated structure can

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:40.232 align:middle line:84%
happen very, very quickly
in the small towns

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:42.167 align:middle line:84%
and create the
domino effect that

00:31:42.167 --> 00:31:46.071 align:middle line:84%
get all the other small towns
to respond the same way.

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:48.173 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens, I think
it's a runaway train.

00:31:48.173 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.042 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me ask you,
devil's advocate.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.278 align:middle line:84%
If anybody out there is
thinking, but, wait a minute.

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.348 align:middle line:84%
We always hear these
tales of our grandparents,

00:31:56.348 --> 00:31:59.351 align:middle line:84%
who worked the land and
that they worked from sunup

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:04.489 align:middle line:84%
to sundown trying to make
a profit from the land.

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.491 align:middle line:90%
Now, where is it--

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:08.026 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: The
key word was profit.

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.094 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The key
word was profit.

00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:09.594 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.028 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: You see, profit.

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You take profit out of
it, it changes everything.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.266 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
making huge amounts.

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously
they're producing food

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:17.936 align:middle line:84%
to feed a lot of
other individuals.

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.771 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way they
would make a profit.

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.873 align:middle line:10%
So where in this model
would you say, no,

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:23.508 align:middle line:10%
this is not idealistic.

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:25.744 align:middle line:10%
What you're talking
about is not idealistic.

00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:30.015 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to work your
little heiny off from sunup

00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:30.749 align:middle line:10%
to sundown.

00:32:30.749 --> 00:32:31.483 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:34.085 align:middle line:90%
So I always tell people--

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:35.754 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, this
is a long discussion

00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:39.057 align:middle line:84%
because this isn't something
that I put together

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.091 align:middle line:90%
over the last few weeks.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:43.528 align:middle line:84%
This has taken me many
years to put together.

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.831 align:middle line:84%
And going through
every aspect of it

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and realizing, as I mentioned
earlier, how simple it is.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.236 align:middle line:84%
Once you break through some of
the real barriers that we have,

00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.071 align:middle line:90%
you realize how simple it is.

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:54.873 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
it utopian dreams.

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:56.041 align:middle line:90%
And I say no, no, no.

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:57.409 align:middle line:90%
It's not utopian dreams.

00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:00.445 align:middle line:84%
It's the natural
order of things.

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the way that nature works.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.549 align:middle line:84%
We're just following the
natural order of things,

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:08.053 align:middle line:84%
and for that reason it's
virtually infallible.

00:33:08.053 --> 00:33:10.989 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-correcting system.

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow it to work,
utilizing the natural order

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.361 align:middle line:90%
of things--

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.296 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are
many other things

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.999 align:middle line:84%
that I need to throw into the
pot to explain what I'm saying.

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-correcting system.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Every problem area
within that community,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.072 align:middle line:84%
the Ubuntu
contributionist community

00:33:27.072 --> 00:33:31.042 align:middle line:84%
that runs without
money, corrects itself

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:33.778 align:middle line:84%
because you always ask
the questions, well,

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.014 align:middle line:84%
how does it benefit all the
people in the community?

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.116 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't benefit the
people in the community,

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.886 align:middle line:84%
then it's not necessary
for the community.

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:41.887 align:middle line:90%
We can have it.

00:33:41.887 --> 00:33:42.654 align:middle line:90%
We can use it.

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:46.057 align:middle line:84%
But then it's not part of
the fundamental structure

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:90%
that the community works toward.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.128 align:middle line:90%
It is an add-on.

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:52.397 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with add-ons.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.632 align:middle line:90%
What happens with add-ons--

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:56.835 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm getting into the
really exciting part of it.

00:33:56.835 --> 00:33:59.571 align:middle line:84%
--what happens, now you were
living in this community.

00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:02.874 align:middle line:84%
You wake up in the morning
with a smile on your face

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:06.278 align:middle line:84%
because what you go and
do is what you love to do.

00:34:06.278 --> 00:34:07.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
dynamic itself

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:10.047 align:middle line:84%
changes the entire
equation because you're

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:14.619 align:middle line:84%
taking fully participatory
human creativity and energy.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:15.987 align:middle line:90%
You don't even need discipline.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.554 align:middle line:84%
Discipline doesn't
exist when people

00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:19.157 align:middle line:90%
are doing what they love to do.

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.391 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't require discipline.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:20.891 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And
you're not doing it

00:34:20.891 --> 00:34:21.693 align:middle line:84%
because you're
earning money for it.

00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it because
you love to do it.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.963 align:middle line:84%
And you choose to do
it for your community.

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.766 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's a
process of how you

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:30.201 align:middle line:84%
get appointed to do
that by your community.

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:32.637 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the community
has allowed you or chosen

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:90%
you to do what that is.

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:36.007 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a
shoemaker, a glass blower,

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:39.244 align:middle line:84%
or a farmer or a
rocket scientist,

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.212 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
community you live in,

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.813 align:middle line:90%
or a teacher or whatever--

00:34:42.813 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Master teachers, but that's
a whole separate subject

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.952 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:34:46.952 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Teaching changes dramatically.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.455 align:middle line:84%
--and so you wake
up in the morning.

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:53.024 align:middle line:84%
And you might just be the
chemical engineer that's

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:84%
waking up, and you've
just figured out

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.896 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to solve
the problem of sewage.

00:34:57.896 --> 00:34:58.463 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using this
as a wild card idea.

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:03.034 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
so excited about this,

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:06.271 align:middle line:84%
you're going to run off to your
work or what it is you do--

00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:07.605 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer working.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.374 align:middle line:84%
You're following
your labor of love.

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:11.276 align:middle line:84%
So jobs and work
are words that are

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:12.711 align:middle line:84%
going to disappear
because now it's

00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:15.647 align:middle line:84%
a labor of love, an
LOL, which you're

00:35:15.647 --> 00:35:18.316 align:middle line:84%
going to do with a
smile on your face,

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.085 align:middle line:84%
laughing out loud
while you're working.

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people have
forgotten what they love.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.221 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:25.156 align:middle line:90%
So there's no bad energy.

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.624 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is
you're doing, you're

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.993 align:middle line:90%
putting all your good energy.

00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:29.661 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's baking
bread, can you

00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:84%
imagine how much good energy
is in the bread that'll

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.732 align:middle line:90%
come out of the bakeries?

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:36.267 align:middle line:84%
And how much love is going to
be in the cheese and the butter

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:37.535 align:middle line:90%
and the woodwork factories?

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
already experience

00:35:39.037 --> 00:35:41.006 align:middle line:84%
that in places that
operate off this principle.

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:41.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:42.874 align:middle line:84%
And remember,
everything is energy.

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.677 align:middle line:84%
If you hate your job, and
you do whatever it is,

00:35:45.677 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and you do it because you're
going to earn some lousy bucks,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.081 align:middle line:84%
and you hate it,
you hate your boss,

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:55.253 align:middle line:84%
you hate the whole process,
that's a recipe for disaster.

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:58.123 align:middle line:84%
If everybody does
this, let's quickly

00:35:58.123 --> 00:35:59.591 align:middle line:90%
look at what happens today.

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:03.728 align:middle line:84%
90% of the time that people
spend during their day

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:90%
is chasing money.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.499 align:middle line:84%
If you backtrack
and you analyze what

00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:09.434 align:middle line:84%
it is that I've
done today, you'll

00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:12.203 align:middle line:84%
realize that most of the
things you do, 90% of the time,

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:15.206 align:middle line:84%
is actions that you've
taken to chase money

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.776 align:middle line:84%
so that at the end of the
day you've earned some money.

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:19.511 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're not
doing that, now you're

00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.447 align:middle line:84%
spending 90% of
your time on things

00:36:22.447 --> 00:36:24.749 align:middle line:84%
you love to do for
your community that

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:28.186 align:middle line:84%
benefits your community
and, therefore, benefits you

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.722 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:36:30.722 --> 00:36:32.857 align:middle line:84%
If everybody does
that, that now it

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.526 align:middle line:84%
means that you're
living in a community.

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:36.027 align:middle line:90%
You're not sitting in traffic.

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:36.528 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:40.331 align:middle line:84%
You live where you work, where
you do what you love to do.

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So now people can
live out of the cities

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.569 align:middle line:84%
in the small little
villages that they

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.404 align:middle line:90%
have a country cottage in.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.673 align:middle line:84%
That they're working all
week so they can get away

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:51.609 align:middle line:84%
for the weekend to go and
spend a few lousy hours

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:52.677 align:middle line:90%
in their country cottage.

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:55.013 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can stay
there forever.

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:59.551 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you wake up
and you do your labor of love?

00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.619 align:middle line:84%
You can only do it
for a few hours a day.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.955 align:middle line:84%
And I use three
hours as an example

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.091 align:middle line:84%
because it's the Holy
Trinity, and I like that.

00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:06.591 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So three hours, the
holy trinity of time

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.829 align:middle line:84%
that you spend
every day doing what

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:12.597 align:middle line:90%
you love for your community.

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:14.499 align:middle line:84%
If you do any more
than that, there'll

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:16.468 align:middle line:90%
just be too much stuff.

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.337 align:middle line:84%
There'll be too much food, too
much water, too much rocket

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.206 align:middle line:90%
science, too much free energy.

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.909 align:middle line:84%
If everybody spends 90%
of their day doing that,

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:25.944 align:middle line:90%
it's just too much stuff.

00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:27.645 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to ease off.

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.048 align:middle line:90%
Take the foot off the gas.

00:37:30.048 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:31.516 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:33.451 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're going
to have too much stuff.

00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:36.454 align:middle line:84%
And that applies on
every level of society

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:39.324 align:middle line:84%
if you start to analyze what
we're talking about here.

00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:41.326 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:43.628 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to
finish what you love doing,

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.897 align:middle line:84%
and then you've got
all this time left.

00:37:45.897 --> 00:37:48.266 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to do something
else that you love to do.

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.835 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty
about our humanness.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
We have many hobbies,
many loves, many passions.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.975 align:middle line:84%
And you can follow
another passion,

00:37:56.975 --> 00:38:00.278 align:middle line:84%
whether it's movie-making
or sculpturing.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:04.449 align:middle line:84%
And in this lies the
example of the other stuff.

00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.219 align:middle line:84%
So now you go home, and you
start doing your sculptures.

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
But you're not doing--

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you have
secondary industries.

00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:13.458 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the world
of art starts coming in.

00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.227 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: But I'm using
this because often arts

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.462 align:middle line:90%
is a questionable thing.

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:20.565 align:middle line:84%
Well, why would the community
want you to just sit at home

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:21.666 align:middle line:90%
and make statues?

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.335 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not
really benefiting anybody.

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.937 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll show you.

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.806 align:middle line:84%
Again, once you work
through this process,

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.608 align:middle line:90%
you will always get the answers.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:33.745 align:middle line:84%
And every one of your viewers
will find the answers.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:37.248 align:middle line:84%
Repeat the mantra, the
five-pointed mantra, no money,

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.485 align:middle line:84%
no barter, no trade, no
value greater or lesser

00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:42.854 align:middle line:84%
attached to anything,
and that everybody

00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:84%
contributes their God-given
talents or their acquired

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
skills to the greater benefit
of all in their community.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.862 align:middle line:90%
The answers are so simple.

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:53.865 align:middle line:90%
So just to quickly explain this.

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:56.868 align:middle line:84%
So you finished your
working in the dairy,

00:38:56.868 --> 00:38:58.236 align:middle line:90%
because you love to make cheese.

00:38:58.236 --> 00:38:58.736 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, you come home, or you
go to the communal area,

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.642 align:middle line:84%
where you study under
the master sculptor.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:07.512 align:middle line:84%
And you start making
beautiful sculptures.

00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:10.882 align:middle line:84%
And within the six
months, there's

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:13.351 align:middle line:84%
such a demand for your
sculptures by the community,

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.087 align:middle line:84%
because remember they're coming
to get it from you for free.

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.689 align:middle line:90%
You're not selling it to them.

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:20.758 align:middle line:84%
People come and get it from
you because that's what you do.

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:24.295 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly the community
comes to the counsel of elders.

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:28.032 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we talk about
it's not a lawless society.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:32.136 align:middle line:84%
It's a very cohesively
structured society.

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:35.139 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on what I
call the council of elders,

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:37.609 align:middle line:84%
the 12 around 1, the
Christic principles,

00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:40.111 align:middle line:84%
the Christ consciousness
principles, the 12

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:42.313 align:middle line:84%
disciples around
Christ, because that

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.616 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect number
in sacred geometry

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to have as your
decision-making council

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.722 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
council of elders

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.591 align:middle line:84%
that, on a daily basis
and an hourly basis,

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.928 align:middle line:84%
decide what's best
for the community.

00:39:56.928 --> 00:39:58.129 align:middle line:90%
It is such a simple thing.

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:01.466 align:middle line:84%
So a bunch of you will run
off to the council of elders

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:04.969 align:middle line:84%
and say, listen, Regina's
statues are so fantastic,

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:07.138 align:middle line:84%
and she doesn't have enough
time to make statues.

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.641 align:middle line:84%
We want Regina to be appointed
as the official sculptor

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:10.308 align:middle line:90%
for our town.

00:40:10.308 --> 00:40:12.377 align:middle line:84%
And the council of elders
will go, oh my goodness,

00:40:12.377 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:90%
you're right.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.544 align:middle line:84%
Regina's sculptures
are everywhere.

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.979 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's
done baking bread.

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.148 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Regina,
it's your choice.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:20.151 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to become the
officially appointed sculptor

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.853 align:middle line:90%
for our town?

00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:23.388 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
bake bread anymore.

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:25.156 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, well,
I love baking bread,

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.924 align:middle line:84%
but you know what, I
prefer making statues,

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.626 align:middle line:84%
and if you'll allow
me to do that--

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.461 align:middle line:84%
So what happens,
the community will

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:34.165 align:middle line:84%
bestow the honor of doing what
it is you do for the community.

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.834 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's interesting
about this is once the survival

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:84%
needs are taken care
of, once the fear leaves

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.906 align:middle line:84%
the cells of our body, which
most people don't know what

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:46.077 align:middle line:84%
that feels like anymore
to truly be without fear,

00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:50.281 align:middle line:84%
and once that happens, our whole
psyche and internal landscape

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:51.115 align:middle line:90%
shifts.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.552 align:middle line:84%
And beauty and
these other esoteric

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:56.954 align:middle line:84%
and finer aspects
of life actually

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:59.223 align:middle line:84%
start coming into
a place of not only

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.292 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to
see them, but truly

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.328 align:middle line:84%
being of a value
and appreciation.

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:06.331 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: That's the
thing, the appreciation.

00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:10.001 align:middle line:84%
There is no better reward
than the appreciation

00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:12.870 align:middle line:84%
of others and the
recognition by others

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.773 align:middle line:84%
for what it is that you are
doing for your community.

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:18.643 align:middle line:84%
No amount of money
could ever even

00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:19.911 align:middle line:90%
begin to compare with that.

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.613 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I believe, why
people have become incredibly

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:25.516 align:middle line:84%
wealthy, and they realize
that money can't buy you love,

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:29.087 align:middle line:84%
money can't buy you happiness,
they start giving it away.

00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:30.722 align:middle line:84%
Because once they
start giving it away,

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
they start to feel
the love of others

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.527 align:middle line:84%
because it increases
the plight of others.

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:40.031 align:middle line:84%
It helps them out of
areas of desperate needs.

00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:45.236 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly they start to feel
a different kind of energy,

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.972 align:middle line:90%
and that changes people.

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.574 align:middle line:84%
And within there is
an interesting mix.

00:41:49.574 --> 00:41:52.944 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, as we
move from the capitalistic

00:41:52.944 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and the consumeristic societies
the ego-driven me, me,

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:02.019 align:middle line:84%
me service to self, and changing
that into service to others--

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:03.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Totally different
internal landscape.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:04.856 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: --people with
huge amounts of money,

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.091 align:middle line:84%
I believe, will start
crawling out of the woodwork

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.693 align:middle line:90%
and say, hold on.

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:10.962 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm going to
do with all this wealth

00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:12.029 align:middle line:90%
that I've acquired.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:14.999 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, what the hell
am I living this life for?

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.101 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even Darwin, in
his lesser known works,--

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.971 align:middle line:84%
Everybody made a big deal out
of the competition and survival

00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:23.040 align:middle line:84%
of the fittest, which is really
only mentioned a few times.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.576 align:middle line:84%
--the greater part
of his work actually

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:29.414 align:middle line:84%
was extolling the
virtues of cooperation.

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:32.016 align:middle line:84%
Our survival is through
cooperation not competition.

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:35.253 align:middle line:84%
And we have somehow
been convinced

00:42:35.253 --> 00:42:38.122 align:middle line:84%
that the other is true, keeping
us in this horrible state.

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.824 align:middle line:84%
And that competition
doesn't happen just

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:40.992 align:middle line:90%
between individuals.

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:42.093 align:middle line:90%
It happens internally.

00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:44.462 align:middle line:84%
We're in internal
conflict ourselves.

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:48.199 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're talking
about, imagining this world,

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:50.635 align:middle line:84%
is where we're making
our contribution,

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle line:84%
but someone else
is contributing.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.006 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up behind you
and flowing through you

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:56.274 align:middle line:90%
in all directions.

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:59.744 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing to fear
when you're all creating this

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:00.478 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:01.779 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: It's so beautiful.

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:05.116 align:middle line:84%
Because what you did you touched
so many important nerve endings

00:43:05.116 --> 00:43:07.585 align:middle line:84%
and fundamentals
of contributionism.

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:10.321 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the fact
that it's a united effort.

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.989 align:middle line:90%
It's unity consciousness.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:14.425 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe
that it's only

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:17.462 align:middle line:84%
through higher
consciousness levels

00:43:17.462 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and as we grow into
the consciousness

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.099 align:middle line:84%
that we start realizing that
that's the only way ahead.

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:23.401 align:middle line:90%
It's the only way ahead.

00:43:23.401 --> 00:43:27.972 align:middle line:84%
It's a system for beings
of higher consciousness.

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, the competition
thing is so absolutely crucial.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.811 align:middle line:90%
Competition, we talked.

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:34.445 align:middle line:90%
Competition.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.913 align:middle line:90%
And it's no.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.782 align:middle line:90%
You want cooperation.

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:40.251 align:middle line:84%
So there's another beautiful
example that I have for people

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:42.587 align:middle line:90%
that say, well, you know--

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:44.789 align:middle line:84%
And I use the thing
of shoes, right,

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:47.158 align:middle line:90%
which is a beautiful example.

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:51.562 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize how huge
the global shoemaking industry

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:54.232 align:middle line:90%
is as far as master shoemakers.

00:43:54.232 --> 00:43:56.801 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge global thing.

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:59.136 align:middle line:84%
Master shoemakers are
revered worldwide,

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:02.006 align:middle line:84%
and the average person on
the street doesn't know this.

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:05.076 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a shoemaker
in my little town.

00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's an athlete in
the most advanced sporting

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.517 align:middle line:84%
facilities because that's what
the community has done, right.

00:44:12.517 --> 00:44:16.888 align:middle line:84%
They've built the most advanced
sporting cultural systems.

00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:21.425 align:middle line:84%
And I've made this amazing
pair of running shoes for John.

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:24.128 align:middle line:84%
And John has just broken the
world record in the hundred

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.297 align:middle line:84%
meter sprint, using
my running shoes.

00:44:26.297 --> 00:44:29.967 align:middle line:84%
Now suddenly, all the other
runners around the world

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.569 align:middle line:90%
want John's running shoes.

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:90%
So what do they do?

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.437 align:middle line:90%
They contact John.

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.772 align:middle line:84%
They say, where did you
get your shoes from?

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.207 align:middle line:84%
He says, I got
them from Michael.

00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:40.378 align:middle line:84%
They contact me and say, can
we have the model for the shoes

00:44:40.378 --> 00:44:41.379 align:middle line:90%
that you made for John?

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And I say, sure.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.314 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:44:43.314 --> 00:44:46.284 align:middle line:84%
Upload it on the free
internet system that

00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:48.753 align:middle line:84%
is a 3D holographic
system because remember,

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:52.623 align:middle line:84%
money no longer keeps
technological advancement down.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.892 align:middle line:90%
So the technology explodes.

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:57.228 align:middle line:84%
And I share that
technology of how

00:44:57.228 --> 00:44:59.363 align:middle line:84%
I made these shoes
with every shoemaker

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world in a few seconds.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:45:03.401 --> 00:45:05.836 align:middle line:84%
But this has to start
with a fundamental shift

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:07.104 align:middle line:90%
in our thinking.

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:10.808 align:middle line:84%
And now, I think everybody
watching this is certainly

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:84%
starting to feel
the possibilities.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.912 align:middle line:84%
Gee, just imagine
if I didn't have

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.481 align:middle line:84%
to go to work tomorrow
at that horrible job

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.783 align:middle line:90%
that I absolutely hate.

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:20.251 align:middle line:90%
We can start feeling this.

00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's going
to have to start also

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.422 align:middle line:84%
with a new generation
of people, meaning

00:45:24.422 --> 00:45:26.691 align:middle line:84%
we have to educate our
children differently.

00:45:26.691 --> 00:45:28.759 align:middle line:84%
The system we're in
creates these little--

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.597 align:middle line:84%
--but it creates
really a droid species.

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:34.198 align:middle line:84%
They've taken
everything beautiful out

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:36.467 align:middle line:84%
of most of the public
education systems.

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.401 align:middle line:90%
The arts are gone.

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:40.338 align:middle line:84%
Even a lot of the sports and
physical movement is gone.

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's down to teaching
for the next test.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.142 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of children,
who are very creative,

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:47.244 align:middle line:90%
have extreme test anxiety.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.346 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:50.281 align:middle line:84%
The education
system is horrible.

00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:53.317 align:middle line:84%
Tell us your model of how that
would work because you wouldn't

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.685 align:middle line:84%
have schools as
we have them now.

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.954 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: What you just
described is not education.

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:57.888 align:middle line:90%
It's indoctrination.

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:58.222 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.523 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: That's what it is.

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:03.461 align:middle line:84%
And true education is
coming into knowledge,

00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:06.897 align:middle line:84%
learning, knowing how to do
things, how to solve problems,

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:10.501 align:middle line:84%
learning how things work,
learning about nature.

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.403 align:middle line:84%
And the first
principles of education

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:14.372 align:middle line:84%
would be, in a
contributionist system,

00:46:14.372 --> 00:46:16.941 align:middle line:84%
is taking the young children
at the earliest of ages,

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:19.477 align:middle line:84%
probably between the ages
of four, five, and six,

00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:21.979 align:middle line:84%
and the first
fundamental principles

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:23.748 align:middle line:84%
is teaching them
the love for Mother

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Earth, the love for Gaia.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.918 align:middle line:84%
Once they have the love for
Gaia and they understand

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:31.288 align:middle line:84%
some of the fundamentals of
how water and soil works, how

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:36.861 align:middle line:84%
to grow seeds, and some of the
real basics, nature, earth,

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:38.863 align:middle line:84%
natural environment,
they will never

00:46:38.863 --> 00:46:41.632 align:middle line:84%
hurt our mother,
Mother Earth, Gaia.

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:45.002 align:middle line:84%
And that's, for me, the
fundamental starting point.

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:48.372 align:middle line:84%
From there, you're
growing conscious beings

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.307 align:middle line:84%
that will always be
responsible and feel

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.677 align:middle line:84%
responsible for what
it is that they do.

00:46:52.677 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the education system
is really, really important

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.382 align:middle line:84%
because it lies at
the foundation of how

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.686 align:middle line:84%
the future civilizations
are going to act and behave.

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.221 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
system is so beautiful.

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.724 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said it's a
self-correcting system?

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:09.827 align:middle line:84%
And before we talk about how
the education system will work--

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:10.995 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's talk about that.

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:11.495 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.264 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
I'm jumping around.

00:47:13.264 --> 00:47:14.699 align:middle line:90%
So there are no classrooms.

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:16.333 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.769 align:middle line:90%
There are master teachers.

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.271 align:middle line:90%
Who are master teachers?

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:22.339 align:middle line:84%
Master teachers can
only be a master teacher

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:25.209 align:middle line:84%
if they were appointed
by the community

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.677 align:middle line:90%
to be a master teacher.

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:31.082 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a shoemaker,
a baker, a farmer, a rocket

00:47:31.082 --> 00:47:33.884 align:middle line:84%
scientist, whatever
it is that you do,

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:37.755 align:middle line:84%
a sculptor, right,
only the community

00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:40.791 align:middle line:84%
can say Regina is
a master sculptor.

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We've appointed her as such.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the children
will come to you

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.833 align:middle line:90%
to learn a process as they grow.

00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:50.601 align:middle line:84%
After they've learned
the love for Gaia,

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:55.239 align:middle line:84%
they go through a sequence
of workshops and internships,

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:90%
little mini internships--

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, are these
based on their own loves,

00:47:59.477 --> 00:48:03.247 align:middle line:84%
their own intrigues
and curiosities?

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:07.718 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It starts off with
basic needs of community, which

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:13.691 align:middle line:84%
is food, water, shelter, health,
the basic needs of community.

00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:16.393 align:middle line:84%
So the children will be
introduced from a young age

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:17.461 align:middle line:90%
into one day.

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:21.165 align:middle line:84%
So one day they'll go and learn
how the farmer milks the cow.

00:48:21.165 --> 00:48:23.901 align:middle line:84%
The next day they'll go and
learn how cheese is made.

00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:24.835 align:middle line:90%
The next day--

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.071 align:middle line:84%
So every day they
learn something new.

00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:29.206 align:middle line:84%
So they become one
day little internships

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.174 align:middle line:90%
for the young children.

00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:31.709 align:middle line:84%
Then they become
two day internships.

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:34.745 align:middle line:84%
Then they become three day,
four day, a week internship.

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.615 align:middle line:84%
By the time a child
is 10 or 12 years old,

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:40.184 align:middle line:84%
they become maybe a month
internship or two week

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:40.785 align:middle line:90%
internships.

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:44.021 align:middle line:84%
You learn everything from
the basic farming stuff

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:48.959 align:middle line:84%
to woodwork to welding
to mechanical stuff

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:53.731 align:middle line:84%
to electronic stuff to rocket
science to nuclear science

00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:90%
to you name it.

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:56.567 align:middle line:90%
You will do that internship.

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:58.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
are sort of examples

00:48:58.235 --> 00:48:59.904 align:middle line:84%
of this that are
going on right now.

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:01.906 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked
about this off camera.

00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:03.941 align:middle line:84%
There is a school,
a model for this.

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:06.143 align:middle line:84%
Have you read the
Anastasia series of books?

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.144 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I
haven't read them all.

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:08.579 align:middle line:84%
But I'm familiar
with the content.

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:10.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So-- but we've
talked about this off camera.

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about a school they

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.885 align:middle line:84%
have there, in which the
kids learn in this way.

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.321 align:middle line:84%
They learn in blocks, where
there are no teachers.

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.989 align:middle line:90%
A teacher is only for reference.

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.692 align:middle line:84%
But it is really the
children themselves

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:25.262 align:middle line:84%
that ask the
questions and discover

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:26.697 align:middle line:90%
the answers among themselves.

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:29.366 align:middle line:84%
Only if they've come to the
point where there are either

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:32.169 align:middle line:84%
no more questions or they can't
figure out the last answer

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.538 align:middle line:84%
is an adult even brought
into the equation.

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.539 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Russia.

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:38.876 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazingly lit
up group of individuals.

00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:41.011 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I think what
you're talking about there

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and I really highly recommend
for every one of your viewers

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.516 align:middle line:84%
to try and find this,
the documentary is just

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:46.217 align:middle line:90%
called School.

00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:48.752 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where you would
find it, but it's phenomenal.

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:51.889 align:middle line:10%
It's this Russian school that
has completely broken down

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.558 align:middle line:10%
all the boundaries
of the way we teach.

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:57.728 align:middle line:84%
And the children write the same
exams as all the other schools,

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.697 align:middle line:84%
and they pass them
with flying colors.

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:00.698 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flying colors.

00:50:00.698 --> 00:50:03.367 align:middle line:84%
It might be a 12-year-old is
the genius in the physics class,

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:04.268 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And they explore it out
over a period of weeks

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.605 align:middle line:90%
til they're done.

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.174 align:middle line:84%
Then they go on to whatever
the next subject is.

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:12.509 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I saw in that
documentary, some of the kids

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.912 align:middle line:90%
write three years in one year.

00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:17.648 align:middle line:84%
And they finish high school,
and they're 13 years old.

00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're developed
on all levels, including

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.051 align:middle line:90%
artistically.

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:23.654 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones that provide
the artwork for the schools.

00:50:23.654 --> 00:50:25.089 align:middle line:84%
They build the school,
for that matter.

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:25.856 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yes,
they do the building,

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.491 align:middle line:90%
the fixing, the everything.

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:29.393 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great
model, I believe,

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:31.795 align:middle line:84%
for an interim phase,
definitely an interim phase.

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
still a school.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.131 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's still a school.

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:34.999 align:middle line:90%
It's still a school.

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:36.133 align:middle line:90%
It's an interim phase.

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:39.103 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
rudimentary classrooms,

00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:41.572 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call them that,
gathering places, where they

00:50:41.572 --> 00:50:44.642 align:middle line:84%
will gather and exchange
information and knowledge

00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:47.745 align:middle line:84%
and experience and learn
other things, where you

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:84%
have to watch
somebody do things.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.815 align:middle line:84%
So yes, of course, there'll
still be classrooms,

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.884 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call them
that, but not the way

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:84%
we think of them
today with a board

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.721 align:middle line:84%
and a teacher
there with a stick.

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.924 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do something
right, you get whacked.

00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:02.293 align:middle line:84%
And we used to get caned
when I was at school.

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:04.561 align:middle line:84%
Six of the best and
all that kind of stuff.

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.163 align:middle line:84%
If you can't regurgitate
it correctly,

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.031 align:middle line:90%
you're going to fail.

00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:08.232 align:middle line:90%
You're useless to society.

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:12.336 align:middle line:84%
See, those are the lies and
the levels of hierarchy.

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:15.873 align:middle line:84%
If you can't regurgitate that,
you're useless to society.

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:19.677 align:middle line:84%
What kind of education
system is that?

00:51:19.677 --> 00:51:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It is completely perverting
the natural order

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.016 align:middle line:84%
of things, where people
use their God-given talents

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.918 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
those around them.

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:28.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in
the system you're

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:30.587 align:middle line:84%
talking about, by the
time the child has gone

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:33.691 align:middle line:84%
through a lot of these basics,
their own innate talents

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and skills are
beginning to surface.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.296 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: By the time
a child is 12 years old,

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:42.032 align:middle line:84%
they will know exactly what they
want to do for their community.

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.334 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you imagine that?

00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:45.069 align:middle line:84%
I can't even tell you
how many of my adult

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:46.737 align:middle line:84%
friends still don't
know what they

00:51:46.737 --> 00:51:48.672 align:middle line:84%
want to do with their
lives because they never

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:51.175 align:middle line:90%
had the luxury of looking at it.

00:51:51.175 --> 00:51:51.875 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
quickly recap that.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.612 align:middle line:84%
So the children go through
these mini internships,

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.981 align:middle line:90%
these little workshops.

00:51:56.981 --> 00:52:00.017 align:middle line:84%
And they get longer and longer
the older the children get.

00:52:00.017 --> 00:52:01.385 align:middle line:90%
And they get excited.

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:03.053 align:middle line:90%
These things are exciting.

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.155 align:middle line:84%
And they stay exciting
because you're not

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.190 align:middle line:90%
cramming it into them.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.959 align:middle line:84%
You're not forcing them to
do it for extended periods,

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:11.528 align:middle line:84%
for one year learning
maths and physics that you

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.297 align:middle line:84%
go, why am I
learning this stuff?

00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:13.831 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:14.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Algebra.

00:52:14.765 --> 00:52:15.632 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.134 align:middle line:90%
Algebra.

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:19.303 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do it, and
you're going to apply it.

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:21.505 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says, well,
actually that's algebra,

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:23.407 align:middle line:84%
and it works like this,
now you understand.

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:27.544 align:middle line:84%
How do lenses in cameras work
that can focus in and out?

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:29.346 align:middle line:90%
You'll find that fascinating.

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.281 align:middle line:84%
Some people will want
to stay with that

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:35.052 align:middle line:84%
and explore that and turn
it into a whole new science,

00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:39.223 align:middle line:84%
while others will want to go on
developing new types of cheese.

00:52:39.223 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.992 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I had that experience.

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:45.229 align:middle line:84%
I was awful at math in
school, and partially

00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:47.164 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't see
the reason behind it.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:48.866 align:middle line:84%
If no one could
explain why I needed

00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:52.236 align:middle line:84%
to do this, besides to
balance a checkbook,

00:52:52.236 --> 00:52:55.005 align:middle line:84%
back to the same problem, then
I wasn't really particularly

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:57.608 align:middle line:84%
motivated, and not a very
good student as a result.

00:52:57.608 --> 00:52:59.877 align:middle line:84%
It was really far
later, when my son, who

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:02.279 align:middle line:84%
went through the Waldorf
School, which is in that

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:05.783 align:middle line:84%
school very oriented toward
planting your own seeds

00:53:05.783 --> 00:53:08.685 align:middle line:84%
and harvesting them in the
fall and making your own bread

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:11.555 align:middle line:84%
and sheering sheep,
and it was really

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:13.357 align:middle line:90%
a pastoral existence for him.

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.259 align:middle line:84%
But he was taught the
wherefore and the why

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:17.227 align:middle line:90%
behind the various maths.

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:19.196 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm embarrassed
to say this, honey,

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.898 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you could
teach me a little bit

00:53:20.898 --> 00:53:23.133 align:middle line:90%
of trigonometry and such.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.935 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can
learn it in an instant

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:27.071 align:middle line:84%
once you understand
the point behind it.

00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:29.339 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:30.741 align:middle line:90%
We are not taught in that way.

00:53:30.741 --> 00:53:32.676 align:middle line:84%
There's no wholeness
to our education.

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.711 align:middle line:84%
So as you say, the
natural brilliance

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.447 align:middle line:84%
can rise right out
of an individual

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:39.283 align:middle line:84%
at a very early
age in this system.

00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:42.186 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I see
this as so beautifully,

00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
naturally progresses from one
area to the next to the next

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:48.025 align:middle line:90%
until--

00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:50.294 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine by
the time you're 16,

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:53.964 align:middle line:84%
and in my model at the age of
16 you finish this process.

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.566 align:middle line:84%
At which point, you
would have probably

00:53:55.566 --> 00:54:00.671 align:middle line:84%
undergone a few three to six
month internships between 14

00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:02.773 align:middle line:84%
and 16 because by then
you pretty much know

00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:08.479 align:middle line:84%
what your real passions
and areas of focus are.

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:10.781 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you're moving
into a serious internship,

00:54:10.781 --> 00:54:11.482 align:middle line:90%
an apprenticeship.

00:54:11.482 --> 00:54:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yes,
apprenticeship.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:13.517 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:54:13.517 --> 00:54:15.886 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
you're 16, you can

00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:18.689 align:middle line:84%
imagine you've done everything
you can imagine, everything.

00:54:18.689 --> 00:54:20.057 align:middle line:90%
You'll know how to milk a cow.

00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:22.292 align:middle line:84%
You'll know how to build a
rocket, how to put together

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:25.329 align:middle line:84%
silicon chips to store
memory in a computer.

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:28.365 align:middle line:90%
You'll know everything.

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:32.503 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody in the world
that has that kind of foundation

00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:35.072 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge or
information or skills.

00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:38.242 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
alien to us today.

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't know
how electricity works,

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.412 align:middle line:84%
why it comes through there
and how it lights up lights.

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's magic.

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.114 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: It's just magic.

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:44.882 align:middle line:90%
It just works.

00:54:44.882 --> 00:54:45.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:46.517 align:middle line:90%
So I think we can see.

00:54:46.517 --> 00:54:48.619 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for a child,
can you imagine?

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:51.255 align:middle line:84%
Every single child would be
engaged in their own life

00:54:51.255 --> 00:54:53.790 align:middle line:84%
under a system like this,
I mean, theoretically.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.626 align:middle line:84%
So now, in this wonderful
theoretical world

00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:56.493 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:58.495 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
of minutes left.

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:01.431 align:middle line:84%
--the reality is
we're likely coming up

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:05.569 align:middle line:84%
for some more bumps
economically globally.

00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:07.938 align:middle line:84%
That puts us into a
greater state of fear.

00:55:07.938 --> 00:55:08.972 align:middle line:90%
How would you recommend--

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.708 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to have
crossover points, and people

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.644 align:middle line:84%
are doing things
like time banking.

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:15.012 align:middle line:84%
They're doing
things like barter.

00:55:15.012 --> 00:55:16.613 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
of the interim steps

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.315 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned before.

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.784 align:middle line:84%
What is your recommendation,
in two minutes or less,

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:22.886 align:middle line:84%
of where we can
start in our hearts

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:26.523 align:middle line:84%
and by agreement with each
other now to begin implementing

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:28.091 align:middle line:84%
this kind of vision
for our world?

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:30.561 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: First of all,
start sharing all your knowledge

00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:32.796 align:middle line:84%
and information with
others, especially if you

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:35.999 align:middle line:84%
have any knowledge
regarding to free energy.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:40.737 align:middle line:84%
That'll free humanity
up in an instant.

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Look at small town
communities, where

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:48.412 align:middle line:84%
you can become an integral
value to developing

00:55:48.412 --> 00:55:51.782 align:middle line:84%
a self-sustainable and
sustained small community that

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:53.684 align:middle line:84%
can have all these things
that we spoke about,

00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:57.187 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentals that then can
move on to the next levels.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.122 align:middle line:84%
And it will probably
go through a system

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:01.992 align:middle line:84%
like time banking, barter and
trade, in the first few phases.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All good
interim steps.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.361 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Absolutely.

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.762 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, to the
point where you

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.297 align:middle line:90%
realize money is not needed.

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:09.933 align:middle line:84%
And it's really important to
think about this right now

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:14.671 align:middle line:84%
because we might be thrust into
this through external forces.

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:17.174 align:middle line:84%
So we have to start thinking
about a moneyless society,

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:21.111 align:middle line:84%
where we work together as
a united community, united

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:21.845 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:24.381 align:middle line:84%
In unity consciousness,
this is what it's all about.

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:25.148 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.551 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
I would like to be

00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:29.052 align:middle line:90%
the baker in your community.

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:31.355 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interviewer
and the baker

00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in your community,
and the dancer.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.725 align:middle line:90%
That's the funny thing.

00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:36.526 align:middle line:84%
Once you start looking
at it you realize,

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:38.662 align:middle line:84%
actually, I love
all kinds of things.

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:40.397 align:middle line:84%
I just haven't had
the time or energy

00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:41.832 align:middle line:84%
to even think about
it because I've

00:56:41.832 --> 00:56:43.934 align:middle line:84%
been so tired trying
to make a buck.

00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:45.035 align:middle line:90%
And that is the story.

00:56:45.035 --> 00:56:46.737 align:middle line:84%
And Michael, I want
to thank you so much.

00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:49.206 align:middle line:84%
I think you've painted a
beautiful picture for people

00:56:49.206 --> 00:56:52.175 align:middle line:84%
of what our world not
only can but, I believe,

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:53.944 align:middle line:90%
will be like in the future.

00:56:53.944 --> 00:56:55.379 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Thanks, Regina.

00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:57.447 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you'd like
to know more about Ubuntu,

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:59.950 align:middle line:84%
you can go to Michael's website
at michaeltellinger.com.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:04.955 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us at Gaiam TV.
