00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia James was
on the fast track

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
as an actress, singer, and
wife of a high profile actor.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But what no one but her
closest friends and family knew

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:84%
was that she suffered
horribly from emotional trauma

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and a lack of self-confidence.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
While this is not an
uncommon story in itself

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the twist comes when
Cynthia took responsibility

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:90%
for her healing as a warrior.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Her journey of healing
resulted in becoming

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
an inspirational
author and lecturer

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
who has the grace and presence
to take this message deep.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
She joins us today to speak
about how we can reveal

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:90%
the very best of ourselves.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And Cynthia, it's
wonderful to see you again.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to see you
and to be with you again.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And to have moments to connect.
-Yes.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And we had a little
bit of time off camera.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And last time I saw
you was in Sedona.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And we had a
magnificent conversation

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
about the previous book
that you had written to what

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
you're working on right now.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to go
back into that conversation

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very personal
and sometimes painful story.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But it gives other
people who have been

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
through these
experiences something

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that they can really kind
of hold on to and relate to.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would appreciate it if you
would start by kind of giving

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
us a little of the
background of your life

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
as the world saw it, which
was very big and very shiny.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what your life was

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
like before we go into what was
going on underneath that story.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:10%
Well I was married
to a famous actor.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:10%
We had a beautiful
home in Malibu.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:10%
Our children went
to the best schools.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:10%
We traveled all over the world.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:10%
It was really incredible.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I was making my living
as an actress as well.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, I was
living the dream life.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.581 align:middle line:84%
Talk about your life as
an actress a little bit.

00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I was the original Lexie
on Days of our Lives.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it was great
because I love theater.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know soap operas
really are theater.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
You're doing everything kind of
live, and quick, and wonderful.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And so that was great.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd go home, I'd
be with the family.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt on a
certain level as though I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
had moved out of my
history and created

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:90%
this extraordinary life.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it was surprising
to me that these things

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%
kept coming up.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
These feelings, and these
emotions, and these behaviors

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
kept coming up in
unexpected ways.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And you try to manage them/
you try to push them down.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:90%
You try to deal with them.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But I became aware that it
was time for me to really look

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
at them because I couldn't mask
what was happening any longer.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's
interesting because we

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
often hear this
story about people

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
who are living "the big life."

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes we read
about them in the headlines

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
because they end up
in either arrest--

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
developing an arrest record
or in rehab or something.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But with you, you
had the presence

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and you had the
courage to begin diving

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:90%
into the deep end of that well.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
how deep that well went.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm speaking about
coming from a lineage of women

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that goes back at least
five generations of abuse.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And so let's begin
at whatever you

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
feel is the appropriate
point in that story.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And certainly going back to
your grandmother at least.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can see and think
of it in our own light

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
how these things-- how
these patterns reoccur.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You know I'd love
to talk about this.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother was born in 1898.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Her name was Mary Swain,
and she died at 99.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
She raised four children
in Alabama on a farm.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
At a time when--
and she was alone--

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and it was a time when
black people in this country

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.025 align:middle line:90%
were really challenged.

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
You know In the way in which
she took care of her children

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
was taking her clothes--
going to pick up

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
the clothes of the Caucasians
in the neighborhood,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
and taking it back
home and washing it,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and having her kids help
iron, and then take them back.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So that she could take
care of her children,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%
that they could get educated.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And then she moved to
Minnesota, bought a home,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and created this life for the
family that was possibilities.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with
all of that though

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is that while the
children-- my grandfather

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
was there before he left--
there was a great deal of abuse.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who was
incredibly beautiful.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean she was like--
-Like you,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh thank you.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean she was like a Rita
Hayworth she was so amazing.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And intelligent and skilled.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather treated
her terribly because she

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:90%
was very intuitive as well.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there were experiences
I think that were mystical.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
her to have those.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And so he would lock her
in under the house in

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:90%
those hot boxes that they had.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Lock her under?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you even do that?

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
someone in the box?

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Well you squeeze them in.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And so she was always
paranoid and always

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:90%
feeling disconnected.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I started uncovering
all of this in my family

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and started to recognize
what was going on with me

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I did research.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I went to the University
of Santa Monica

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and we had to do a genogram.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Five generations of
women had been abused,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
raped, traumatized.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Did that happen to-- was
it your great grandmother?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It was my great
grandmother who was a slave,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%
brought over as a slave.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And the slave owner
raped her in front

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of the entire slave group.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
And she conceived.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And so she hated her child.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that continued the
abuse on another level.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very-- it was
very disheartening on one level

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to find out that it had
been going on for so long.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But there was this kernel
within me that said,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:90%
well maybe I can shift it.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Because my stepfather
was the perpetrator.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
My mother married for the
second time to get out.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Because my biological
father left pretty early,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
he was an alcoholic.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so she married this man
who beat her consistently.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Did you witness the beatings?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, totally.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
-That's very difficult.
-Very.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember being about six years
old and hearing her scream.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
She was pregnant with my
brother and going into the room,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and he was straddling
her, smacking her.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And she's screaming get out.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Because she wanted
me to be safe.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.587 align:middle line:84%
-Telling you to get out?
-Yeah.

00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Telling me to get out.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I was mouthy
and expressive.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that probably did not
help the relationship with him.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And this went on-- I
was six years old--

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:90%
this went on for almost a year.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Until at some point
something in her

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:90%
said I can't do this anymore.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And she had my uncle
come and take everything

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:90%
that she owned in sheets.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And she got out because she
only had a 20 minute window

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
before my stepfather came back.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was-- I didn't
remember all this until I was

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%
in my 30s and I was in therapy.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
trying to find out

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
why I was disconnected
at points and I

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:90%
would disassociate at points.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it was really quite
interesting for me to say,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is why.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:90%
To open to it.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a therapist
at one point who

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
said quite innocently,
have you ever

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:90%
been abused by your father?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
At which time I fell out of
the chair on the floor and was

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:90%
curled up.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And that opened up the
door for me to look at it.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But had you not had memory
of it up to that point?

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:90%
You had shut it out.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You must have compartmentalised
your emotions in mind

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
to the extent because
you couldn't bear

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:90%
it-- to even think about it.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
You must have just pushed
it to the back of the mind.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.089 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I think really what happens
is you fight, flight,

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
or you leave.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And I dissociated.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I think I just pulled
myself out of my body.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
in therapy and there

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
was something going
on and the therapist

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:90%
said to me, where are you?

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware
that a part of me

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
was kind of hanging up
on the ceiling watching,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
that I had left my body.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the work was
to get me back into my body

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.049 align:middle line:84%
so I could feel.
-Oh.

00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So now during these
experiences that you endured

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
with your stepfather
were you out of body

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
during those experiences?

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I must have been.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I had-- there were little
memories that came back.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was so grateful
my mother was alive.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you know the remembering
of those kinds of things,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of controversy
about whether it happened

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and whether the therapist
implanted stuff.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But when I went
back to my mother

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and I started describing
these memories

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and these little flashes
she began to weep.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Because she thought
I wouldn't remember

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
because I was so young.
-Oh.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I was six.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:90%
You were six.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking pretty
extreme abuse I take it?

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty extreme.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Pretty extreme.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And so as you're working
with this therapist and this

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is being revealed from
you to your conscious mind

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
for its understanding.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
What was your very-- you say
you were in a fetal position

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
on the floor-- what was
your first response?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to talk
about the lineage of what

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
happens once you're
confronted with this

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
if it has been
erased essentially

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:90%
from your conscious awareness.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
You know I remember
the therapist getting

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
on the floor with me and
basically kind of holding me

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and telling me I was safe.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And asking me what was going on.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't totally
clear but I was

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
aware something happened to me.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And so that became the work.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
To uncover it so that I could
be safe enough not to leave.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
at six years old

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
your only option is to try
to run away on some level.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you had run away
on an emotional level.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So once the memory
is fully back you

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
had to start working
with this, which there

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:90%
are a lot of implications.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's anger, there's
mistrust, all these things.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all, tell us how
those things were reflecting

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:90%
in your adult relationships.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean we can--

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:90%
A mess.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You know really I tell
people that I really--

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:90%
it was a path of discovery.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
A relationship was a
path of discovery for me.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept repeating
the same relationships

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:90%
over and over.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Different people in
different bodies.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Because I couldn't understand.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I was this loving,
connected person

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and yet when people would
get close to me everything

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:90%
would shut down.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Because really
what it was saying

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:90%
was that I couldn't trust love.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in our last
conversation one thing

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
you shared with me
was that when it came

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to personal
relationships-- and we're

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
talking about California and
eras where free love existed.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Where people could hook
up with one another.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was OK when
you first met a man,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:90%
before you really knew him.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
You know when you were
first getting together.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
That was OK because
there wasn't any really

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.681 align:middle line:84%
deep intimacy there yet.
-Right.

00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Exactly.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
when someone wanted

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.290 align:middle line:90%
to get a little closer to you?

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
can relate to this.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Everything shut down.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I, I-- my sexuality,
my ability to connect,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:90%
my ability to communicate.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And these protectors,
these huge protectors

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
went up because it
was just too scary.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
You know what if I'd have to go
back to that original trauma.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't a conscious
thought but that's what

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:90%
was running in the background.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
the partners that

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
came into your life you say--
and in your previous book

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
you talk about this--
that we keep creating

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:90%
these same fields of resonance.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We keep being drawn back
to what is familiar to us.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
No matter how unhealthy it
is, it's familiar until we

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:90%
actually break the pattern.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that in the
subsequent relationships

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
throughout your adult life-- was
it abusive patterns with men?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Or was it simply that you were
shutting down and creating

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
the issues for yourself?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Or a combination of both?

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
It was both.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
It was both.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
People who were alcoholics,
who were drug addicts, who

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
are cheaters, who had multiple
relationships besides me,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and all of that was going on.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And the ability-- it was
like I could chase them.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
But when they'd turn around
and it would be like,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I want you.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:90%
It was like, OK, too scary.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Too scary.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So you could never get
very far with it really?

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.665 align:middle line:84%
-Couldn't get far with it.
-But you did.

00:13:21.665 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
You got far enough
where you had a family.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.041 align:middle line:84%
And you had a very
shiny looking life.

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Well because you know what--
-- this is what I discovered

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
in all the work
that I did, is that

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
when you've been
abused you get really

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
good at being a chameleon.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You get really good at
being what the people

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
that you're with want.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So what they drink, you drink.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:90%
If they smoke, you smoke.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
If they like this,
you like this.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
became a chameleon.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
is that the essence

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
of who I am, the
authenticity of who I am,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
would start to come up.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And when that would
start to come up that

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
would tweak the people.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Because this isn't the
person that I connected with.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the person
that I engaged with.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Where is she?

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I couldn't
push it back down.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there would
be this conflict,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%
internal and external.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I would assume that
in this-- what you're saying

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
is not only were you a
chameleon but a part of you

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:90%
becomes a pleaser.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Do anything to have love.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Do anything so that
people won't leave you.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Do anything so
that you don't have

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
to be alone to
deal with this pain

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:90%
that is coursing through you.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And now as I'm listening
to you on this,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
you went through some rather
extreme types of abuse.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Most people that are
watching this were raised

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
in-- most households
were just not conscious

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:90%
as to what we know now.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean so much has
bubbled to the surface

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:84%
in the last few decades as to
how vulnerable little children

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:90%
are to their environment.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
To do the things you say and
do to them that our parents

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
didn't know about.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
In their generation it
was basically children

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
should be seen and not heard.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't let
them have any voice.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And to put them
out on the street

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:84%
or to give them a good
slap was just considered

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%
a normal means of discipline.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So coming into--
you know-- coming

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
into this way of
consciousness now,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
would you say that most people
that are watching this also

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
went through their
own form of this kind

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of disrespectful treatment
on one level or another?

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that with most
of the people you meet,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
man and woman?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I do coaching with people and I
was with a couple this morning.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:10%
And the man came from
this really wonderful

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:10%
successful family and yet a
father that was disconnected,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:10%
that didn't know
how to show love.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:10%
And a mother that had these
high expectations and there

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:10%
were punishment when
that didn't work.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:10%
And people don't realize
that when love is withheld

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:10%
from them, when
they're not seen,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:10%
or when they're not
recognized, when

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:10%
they don't have a voice in their
growing up, it has an impact.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
create an identity based

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
on what will make them safe.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Based on who they're
going to be in the world.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And feel like
someone can see them.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.461 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
control the situation.

00:16:23.461 --> 00:16:25.031 align:middle line:84%
Right .
Yeah, all external stuff.

00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Right.
All external.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
fixing and creating

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
that being from within,
but from kind of pasting

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
a business card on the outside.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.789 align:middle line:84%
Ha ha.
Exactly.

00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
you also have said before

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is that you were given
many opportunities

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
along the way to
pull yourself out

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of the patterns you were in.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.901 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
You know I'm a blessed person.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It was like there were angels
around me that would show up

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
as teachers, that would
show up as-- I mean

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I had Mrs. Milky
and Mr. Benson where

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:90%
my elementary school teachers.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And I was a mess.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was angry.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could figure
out why because I

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
had all this these
gifts, and this talent,

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and this intelligence.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet there would
be these outbursts.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:90%
And these two teachers saw me.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean they saw me,
they understood me,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:90%
they encouraged my creativity.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so loved.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think that
did was plant within me

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
the seed of possibility
that that exists.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And so along the way there were
mentors, there were teachers.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
People who said, come over
here, let me help you.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean there was
a woman who said,

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:84%
you know you have this
wonderful energy and charisma,

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:90%
you should be a model.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And so-- took me into
a department store

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and I became a model while
I was in high school.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Someone saw me and that
I had this gift of gab

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and I became part of the
debate team, and chess.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So even though there was
all this craziness going

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
on in different places in
my life there were people

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:90%
who were saying, I see you.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Come over here and let me
help you share your gifts

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:90%
and shine your light.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're starting to get
little touchstones here

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of where your talents and
your gifts in life were.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But as your relationships
on the outside

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
progressed you
were still falling

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
back into the same patterns.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know the older you
get, the more sophisticated

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:90%
you get at it.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So what's that mean?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that you
learn to cover up those things

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
that you perceive as flaws.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And I learned what not to say.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
How to act with certain
groups of people.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:90%
How to show up.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:90%
How to dress.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:90%
How to bring my talents in.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But not to show them
what I was feeling.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Not to talk about the pain
that was going on internally.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And to suppress my own voice
if it meant in any way, shape,

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:90%
or form, there was danger.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I hear you say that, I
think about-- this is something

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about quite a
bit-- when we watch films,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, or we
read books, the moment

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
that people feel the most
connected with the character

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is when they're at their
own most vulnerable.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:84%
When someone is able to reveal
what they've been going through

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and how they feel.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And that opens up our hearts
like blossoms to them.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet that's the very thing
that we're so afraid to allow

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
anybody else to see.
-Well, yeah.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Because that vulnerability
makes you naked.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But that nakedness-- I mean
it appears over and over.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean through art
up to real life

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the very thing that is
the beginning of the healing,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
isn't it?
-Well, totally.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Because really in the depths
of the pain is the healing.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that all
of these things that we go

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
through, and all these
experiences and the awakenings

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have, are to bring
us to a point of healing

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and the health and wellness.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But but being vulnerable like
that is really-- if you don't

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
know what to do with
the vulnerability,

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't think that
there is safety in the world,

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
then you want to cover it
up as soon as possible.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
terrified that that pain

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.051 align:middle line:84%
will come back in a way that's
unexpected and brutal maybe.

00:20:29.051 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And that maybe you can't manage.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You've learned how to
manage it and contain it up

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:90%
to that point.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who
ultimately came into your life

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.031 align:middle line:84%
and was really able to
help you open up to this

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and move through.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about that experience?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman
who-- who said,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
you do not have
to live this way.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.229 align:middle line:84%
-That's the lady.
-Yeah.

00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to live this way.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
sell yourself out.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give
yourself away to be loved.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But for some
reason you actually

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.151 align:middle line:90%
heard the message that time.

00:20:59.151 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It's can't be the first
time you've heard it.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, because she loved me.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
She loved me and didn't
want anything from me.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't trying to mold
me or control me.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:90%
She just wanted me to wake up.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was with
such love and heart.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a thing
we've witnessed

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
in so many other people's
lives, all of us have.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Where we've seen someone who's
really struggling in life.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Who is sabotaging their lives.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Who's putting up
with things they

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:90%
should not be putting up with.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:90%
And you can't help them.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.175 align:middle line:84%
You can-- another person
may have said that to you.

00:21:36.175 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You may have had people saying
it to you every other week.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But until something in you
could trust that that was true,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and you were ready to hear
the message, we can't hear it.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the frustrating part.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We want to go around fixing--
trying to fix ourselves.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going around try to
fix each other all the time.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you just did this-- and
giving her a big fat opinion.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.331 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is you
can't tell anybody else.

00:21:57.331 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
-No.
-Until it's time.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
You can't do anything.
-Nope.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is
that I do believe

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes those people
telling us those things

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:90%
plant seeds within us.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody shows up
and puts the right water on it

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:90%
and it blossoms.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is
that when you look

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
at any kind of addiction, any
kind of challenges in people's

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:84%
lives, until they
want to change nothing

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
is going to make them change.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You know I went to Al Anon
because of my father's

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:90%
alcoholism and stuff.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, you
can't hide the alcohol.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk him out of it.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't manipulate
them out of it.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.941 align:middle line:84%
Until they want to change
they're going to just do

00:22:40.941 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
what they need to do.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's true
for every human being.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably the
most frustrating thing

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of our personal
relationships with others.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're
the kind of person

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that really wants to be of
some kind or service or help.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not your business
until that person's ready.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you can only
change yourself.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Exactly.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
You can only heal yourself.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes people
try to change other people

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:84%
because they are afraid if
they change they're going

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:90%
to-- the relationship will end.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
-It did for you.
-Oh.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It totally did.
It totally did.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what happened
when you started changing.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.681 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're talking
about losses in friendship.

00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
A real breakage because you're
becoming and emerging-- you're

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.021 align:middle line:84%
emerging into a
different human being.

00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
My spirituality became
very important to me.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual practice, my work
with the therapist, my wanting

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
desperately to get
clear about who I was

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and what was going on with me.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And it changed the dance.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It changed the dance
in the relationship.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was having
his own challenges.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And so they escalated.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And because I was
becoming clear,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and because I wouldn't go
back into that old behavior,

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
he didn't know
what to do with it.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately he opted
out of the relationship.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was challenging
for me and the kids.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
But it was really a gift.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when I look
back, that relationship

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
afforded me the
ability and the space

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:90%
to do really deep inner work.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And even though it was
painful when I got out of it

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I got to find out who am I?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
How do I want to
be in the world?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to share my gifts?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, who am I if I'm
not in a relationship,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
being what somebody else needs?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Who am I?
And that was big.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one
for women in general.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Oh.
Totally,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I think if there is a gender
divide, that is a really

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:90%
big one between men and women.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.091 align:middle line:84%
Women so define themselves by
the relationships they're in.

00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Well.
Yeah.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:90%
We're inculturated.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean people are giving us
dolls and little cook things

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:90%
from the time we're little.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
You know it was like,
this is what you do.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But for me it was like,
wow , if I stop dating,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not looking
for Mr. Right,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:90%
then who am I and what do I do?

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And it it led me back to school.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It opened up new ways
of thinking for me.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It opened up a new
career path for me.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really allowed me to
look at my thought patterns

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and what I was creating.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And then it also helps
you understand the nature

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of your connection with
friends and other people

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.061 align:middle line:84%
in you're-- maybe not immediate
family-- but in the environment

00:25:39.061 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
around you.
That changes with it.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not having the
same conversations

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:90%
with people anymore.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've been through
that where it's, I

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
don't want to participate
in that level of discussion

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.411 align:middle line:84%
And friends react very
quickly to know that.

00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Sometimes they leave.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the pattern
of-- whatever it is together--

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:84%
they're not getting
the satisfaction

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
from the same
relationship anymore.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same relationship.
-Right.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
the relationship

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
ended, when the marriage
ended, some people

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:90%
just exited all together.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.281 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that they
created space for the new tribe

00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to come in.
-Yes.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.339 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up at this
small spiritual community.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
Michael Bernard Beckwith

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
was a practitioner there.
-Oh, yes.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of us kind
of migrated into this place

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to
classes together,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
we had these deep conversations,
we support each other

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:84%
through health challenges,
through going to school,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:90%
through raising our children.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was powerful.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
you had to deal with--

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and you talk about at great
length, including in you're

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
working with other people--
is the body has its own memory

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:90%
of anything we're experiencing.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be physical abuse.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But where you have
physical abuse

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:90%
it may be even more pronounced.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.251 align:middle line:84%
-It's encoded.
-It's encoded.

00:26:58.251 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Yeah,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:10%
What I discovered is that
in the five generations

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:10%
there were distinct things that
kept showing up each generation

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that were in the body.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:10%
And so the majority of
the women in my family

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:10%
died with illnesses, overweight,
emotional challenges, that

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:10%
showed up in very similar ways.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that caused
me to look at, well,

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:84%
what is it that is in the
body that is transmitting

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
information and has
created neural paths

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:90%
that don't support me?

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing
a lot of research

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of working on my
body to open up energies.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I hired a trainer
whose expertise

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:90%
was emotional challenges.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the person what
would-- as I was working out--

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.931 align:middle line:84%
would be witnessing parts of
the body that were constricting

00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and stuff.
And we'd go into those places.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time
laying on the bench

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm lifting the weights,
and all of a sudden I

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
literally felt my
stepfather on top of me.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.174 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do
not run from that.

00:28:09.174 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:90%
The trainer said that?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The trainer said, do not run
from that-- as I'm pushing

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:90%
this weight and sobbing.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And eventually there was
this release in my body.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went home and
I got in the shower

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and as the water was hitting me
I realized I was feeling water

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.290 align:middle line:90%
on my body for the first time.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But there was a dance
at another point?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.034 align:middle line:84%
Is it at that point
or another point?

00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it was another
point when you were working

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
with someone where
your stepfather came

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
through from the other side.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a woman who was a
healer and a body worker.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was doing a massage
on me and she stopped.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, someone
is coming through

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and wants to speak to you.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately saw the
image of my stepfather

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:90%
in the suit with the hat.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And right after I saw the
image she said, he's in a suit

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.630 align:middle line:90%
and he's got a hat.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said he wants
to speak to you.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.791 align:middle line:84%
And I was flitting between
intrigue and anger.

00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-That he was in my space.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I said OK.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he said to me.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, you have been
dragging me around

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and I need you to have the
angels cut the cord between us

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:90%
so that we can both be free.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I mean I fee
a little emotional about it

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
stunningly true.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That I had been dragging
him through my whole life

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
with the anger, and the
judgments, and the resentments,

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and the shame.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And we were still connected
because I wouldn't let it go.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And we don't stop
and think about that.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Did part of you resent the
fact that he was asking

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:84%
you to do this
because you didn't

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:90%
want to maybe do that for him?

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.561 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Talk about it.

00:29:57.561 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us have
these things with the deceased,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
on many levels.
-Well.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was like he
didn't deserve to be free.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean I wanted him to be
in punishment and upset

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and you know.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet a part of me knew that
when we passed the other side

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you know we're not in
some place called Hell.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean you know that there's
a freedom of the soul.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:90%
But it was so striking.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Because really I felt like
once I got past the saying,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:84%
you know he doesn't
deserve this, it was like,

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
this is about my freedom.
-Right.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
If I don't cut this cord,
if I don't let him go,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I will drag him into
every relationship,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:90%
every aspect of my life.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.520 align:middle line:84%
-Which you had been.
-Right.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
after this moment?

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I made a decision.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a one woman
show about my life.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.394 align:middle line:84%
And the cutting of the cord
became the end of the play.

00:30:49.394 --> 00:30:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I did it all
over the country.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was incredible.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Each time I did it the
cutting of that golden cord

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:90%
was like a freeing of my body.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And people would stay in
the theater after the play

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and want to have
discussions about it

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to know
how they could do that.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it was so hard
to let go of the anger,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and the resentment, and
the pain that had been

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%
put upon them by these people.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Well let's talk about that.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Because people listening
right now may want to know,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:84%
how can I do that when I
am so angry at this person?

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
recommend a person

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
begin the process
of cutting the cord

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.880 align:middle line:90%
when you're still ticked off?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:90%
When you're still hurt.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.334 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the
first chapter of the book

00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:90%
in What Will Set You Free.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.861 align:middle line:84%
I have people write the story
in all the gory details.

00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Write it.
Write it.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Get it out.
Get it out.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Get it out.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:10%
And then to look
at the possibility,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:10%
what would my life be like if
this story wasn't running me?

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:10%
If this wasn't how I
was identifying myself.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:10%
If this isn't how I
was looking at myself.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:10%
What would my life look like?

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:10%
And that one little question
opens up with people.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:10%
Because they-- well,
I'd be happier.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:10%
I could have healthier
relationships.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:15.760 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't be dominated by
all of these insecurities

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:10%
and these feelings
of lack of worth.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would be able
to find out what

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:90%
it is in me that's important.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
What it is in me that makes
me essential to this planet.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the first thing.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing is to support

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:90%
people in finding their voice.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Because most people who
have been-- whether it's

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
beaten, or sexually abused, or
just emotionally traumatized--

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:90%
they have shut down their voice.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that you
know that is that when you get

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
ready to have a conversation
that's uncomfortable,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
you're throat chakra
will constrict.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And it will hurt.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And your jaws will get tight.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the back of your
head will constrict.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And those are all signs
that you have lost

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:90%
your ability to use your voice.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you're essentially
saying that a person is

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:90%
given this golden opportunity.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you can find it for
your own self-interest,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:84%
even not necessarily even
to release the other person

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.150 align:middle line:84%
at this point, if
you can find it

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:84%
in yourself to go
through this process

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.051 align:middle line:84%
you get a chance
rewrite the script.

00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And get rid of the shame and
the guilt, which is toxic.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.630 align:middle line:84%
To move into states of
forgiveness and choose.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you start to realize
that your life is about choice.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:90%
That every moment is a choice.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And that these experiences are
just energy and information

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and that you don't
have to claim them.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't belong to you.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And that you can say, well
what does belong to me?

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to show up?

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And do I really want
to walk through my life

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
with this level of pain attached
to me as though it's a weight?

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.526 align:middle line:84%
And do you want to label
yourself in that way?

00:33:58.526 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Even the words themselves
have a lot of power and import

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we
become in our adult lives

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and throughout our lives.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to label
yourself in that way?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I'm
really clear about.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.870 align:middle line:84%
When I hear people
talking about their lives

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:84%
as victims of this, that,
and the other thing--

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.170 align:middle line:90%
not a good place to come from.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.039 align:middle line:84%
I mean after all of this do
you believe in victim-hood?

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You know what, I mean I know
it exists energetically.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But you know I talk to
people about this path

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:90%
of chaos and unrest.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.560 align:middle line:84%
That an event happens and you
make a decision-- mentally,

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, consciously,
unconsciously-- you

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:90%
make a decision.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And then your whole
psyche starts looking

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
for proof that you're right.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes out and it starts
to create and recreate itself

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
until you can get to a place
where you understand that it's

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:90%
all made up in your mind.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
That you know when a lot of the
scientists talk about the fact

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that they drop these
chemicals and attach

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
the feelings in all that, that
your mind is mastering you.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to you choosing
how you want to live.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And how you want to show up.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And how you want to
express in this world.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That you are not a victim
of anything or anyone.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You get to say how
you want to live.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And if people can't
accept it and love you

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:84%
the way that you
are, authentically,

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.600 align:middle line:90%
then they don't belong there.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Well this obviously
leads to forgiveness,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:90%
the subject of forgiveness.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a different
take on what that word means.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I have my own take on
what that word means

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and diffusing that subject.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- how do you
view the word forgiveness?

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And the actual act?

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know everything is
viewed from my point of view

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:84%
through perception,
through filters.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever
you've made a decision

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:84%
you judge everything
through those filters.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And so forgiveness is really
forgiveness of us, of self.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of those perceptions
that do not support your health

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:90%
and your well being.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And then deciding to choose
what you are calling in.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing love.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing peace.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you-- first
of all, I don't

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
believe that spiritually
people have to be forgiven.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the universe loves us
wherever we are in the process.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
forgiveness is for letting

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:84%
go of any perception that you
didn't deserve to be loved,

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
or had, or that someone
had power over you.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big one.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Because to let go of the fact
that my stepfather controlled

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:84%
my life, and that I was allowing
him to do it well into my 30s,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:90%
was eye opening.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well,
if he's not, and I

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
can let that go,
and step back-- I

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:84%
got to see all the
places I abused myself.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Over eating, over drinking,
not taking care of myself.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.116 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh, so now I'm
doing to me what he did to me.

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
Yeah.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can choose differently.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I can choose to love me.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, there's
another component to that.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And in my perception, which
is when you start looking more

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.270 align:middle line:84%
deeply at the other
person as well,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:84%
you usually start
seeing the same patterns

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:90%
in their own life.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.191 align:middle line:84%
Your father was also subject
to abuse when he was young.

00:37:22.191 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-You're stepfather.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Alcoholism.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.739 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:25.739 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And the stepfather
had a lot of abuse.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
when I work with people

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
you find out that there have
been generations of this stuff

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:90%
that people have carried.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But what I tell people
is, you can stop it today.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.210 align:middle line:90%
You can stop it today.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Just because it came
through five generations,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the buck can stop here.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You can shift yourself and
model for your children

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.990 align:middle line:90%
what's possible.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I found-- and I
don't totally understand it--

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:84%
but it shifted going back in
time with my family members.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
An aunt who passed
away-- I mean we

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.334 align:middle line:84%
had an incredible
conversation where she talked

00:38:07.334 --> 00:38:08.700 align:middle line:84%
about something that
had happened to her,

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and released it for the
first time in '65 years.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:90%
My mother had shifts.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And my relatives have had
shifts because they've

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
seen the shifts in me.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It has an impact in
your entire environment.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:90%
The whole matrix changes.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.701 align:middle line:84%
When one person gets it,
the whole matrix changes.

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Absolutely.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's a power-- that's
a very powerful kind of take

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.220 align:middle line:90%
away in this conversation.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And for me to understand.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:84%
To simply understand
another person's journey

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
defuses a lot of the
personal part of it.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's like OK, yes.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have not been through
what you've been through.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how I would
feel under those circumstances.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But to the degree that one
can feel like you maybe

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:84%
ended up on the short end of the
stick in certain circumstances.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I find that if I
can look into them

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and see that person
was experiencing

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
so much pain themselves.
-Completely.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not personal.
Really.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It may look personal, they've
got their own problems.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Just work on fixing yourself.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no point in blaming.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And I find that if
you can understand

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that other person's
journey there's

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:90%
just no need for forgiveness.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.982 align:middle line:90%
It's really more understanding.

00:39:12.982 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:84%
You know forgiveness,
for me, I almost

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.890 align:middle line:84%
see it as kind of almost
like a pious thing--

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say, I shall
deem you worthy of forgiveness.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't, I don't-- I
don't like that tone.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.419 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And really do we have a
power anyway to do that?

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:26.396 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:27.096 align:middle line:90%
We don't,

00:39:27.096 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really about letting go.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Understanding.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Understanding your part.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Understanding their part.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Not perpetuating the story.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And kind of getting on
with it to the new level.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you've gotten on
with it in many ways.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean you've
become really quite

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:90%
a leader in your community.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
new book out, which

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.180 align:middle line:84%
is called Revealing Your
Extraordinary Essence,

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:90%
which is really beautiful.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a workbook.
-It is.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you've put together

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:84%
as a result of now decades
of unraveling your own story

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and helping other people as a
counselor in self-empowerment.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And let's go into that book.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:90%
We have some time to do that.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You have it broken
down into very kind

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:90%
of clear topic headings.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken out a few
of them here, depending

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:10.600 align:middle line:90%
on how much time we have.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But are you comfortable going
through the book that way?

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I just want to start--

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Tell us your point
of writing it first.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.239 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
That what if we knew that
the core of our being

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:90%
was really extraordinary?

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:84%
That we did not come
here to be uncommon.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
That we came here to be
exceptional, and powerful,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.990 align:middle line:90%
dynamic, and mighty.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:90%
What if we knew that?

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Then we would operate from
a totally different field.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
reason for doing the book.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And that people go away
from workshops, or classes,

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
or experiences, and they
have these great ahas.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they get home
and they start drifting

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
back into those old behaviors.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted to give them
practical tools that they could

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:10%
use every day to
keep them centered

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.575 align:middle line:10%
in the remembrance
of who they are

00:40:56.575 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:10%
and who they came here to be.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And that speaks
to almost everyone.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't even tell you how
many different workshops-- more

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:84%
so conferences and
such I've been to-- I

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:84%
hear all these
extraordinary things.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're back
at the end of the day

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and you're yourself.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you've done a lovely
job with that by the way.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's start on
some of the topics

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that you find that
are really important.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And the first one we'll
start with is connection.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:90%
"Connect."

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Being present.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Connect to yourself.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Being present with other people.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm sitting here
looking in your eyes

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and then were having
this conversation.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And because there's a
connection I feel your heart.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I feel your authenticity.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I feel you looking into my soul.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that connection
allows you to be present.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not thinking about
what happened before, what's

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the future.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.470 align:middle line:90%
You're really present.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect,
the heart opens.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And there is this space of
vulnerability and connectivity

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:90%
that is extraordinary.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do then is
you cease to worry about what

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:90%
was before and what's coming.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the only thing
is this delicious moment.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And how much of the time are we
ignoring this delicious moment

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:16.600 align:middle line:84%
while we're trying to text,
carry on a conversation,

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.941 align:middle line:84%
and drive, and maybe put your
lipstick on at the same time?

00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion
of multitasking

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:84%
has created not just
short attention spans,

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:84%
but from-- even though we're
attempting to become more

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and more connected through
technology-- that very thing

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about that's
happening right here with you

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and me is the thing that's
not happening between people.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge rise
in social isolation.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:90%
The statistics are staggering.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:90%
That we are withdrawing.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And we are fixating on
these little computers.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing
all these things.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And we are not
touching one another.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not connecting
with one another.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it is having an
impact with cardiomyopathy.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It is taking away the
ability to process.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so stress
hormones are rising

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:90%
and creating overweight people.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's-- people
aren't sleeping.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's huge.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
technology is great.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I love the opportunity that
it's given us, but we cannot

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.950 align:middle line:90%
forget that we need each other.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.690 align:middle line:84%
That we need to be
with each other.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:28.160 align:middle line:84%
That having someone
hold you is a gift.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean even heart
disease in women--

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.461 align:middle line:84%
the statistics of heart disease
in women is skyrocketing,

00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think it has a lot
to do with what you're talking

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:90%
about, this disconnection.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you they
talk about, oh, being

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:90%
with my friends feeds my heart.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're with your
friends in a superficial way,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
or-- like kids texting
each other sitting

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:90%
next to each other.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.129 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Ha ha.

00:43:55.129 --> 00:43:56.795 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha.

00:43:56.795 --> 00:43:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I have grandchildren.

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.791 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah,
what are you doing?

00:43:59.791 --> 00:44:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Exactly.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.400 align:middle line:84%
This thing that happens opens
up the this whole cascade

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals within our being.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Right?
-Exactly.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
And--

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.860 align:middle line:84%
There is part of our health
and well being-- physically,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.180 align:middle line:90%
mentally, emotionally.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%
It starts to shut down areas.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to tell us that
we are not interconnected,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
which is why we are seeing
some extraordinary things going

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.780 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Because people do not
understand that what one does

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.100 align:middle line:90%
effects the whole.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost to the point
of being phobic about even

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.580 align:middle line:90%
looking in each other's eyes.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.795 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:44:34.795 --> 00:44:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We look away when we're
walking down the street.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:84%
You know if someone
smiles we divert our eyes.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really?

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is another human
being who has the same needs

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and desires that you have.
-Right.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So that resonance,
that connection,

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that's part of our
path to health.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The next one, it says
is "clear." "Clearing."

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
clearing because that

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:90%
has a couple implications.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.767 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know we like
to do spring cleaning

00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%
and we clear everything out.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But you know clearing
really is about energy--

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.210 align:middle line:90%
mental, emotional, physical.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:84%
We stuff stuff in closets
because nobody can see them.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like it doesn't exist.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Except that energy is still
cluttered in that place.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So the clearing is
your willingness

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to open up, look at those
places that serve you,

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:23.250 align:middle line:90%
that empower you.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at
those places that don't.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And being willing to go
into them to clear them out.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
taking up space that

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
could be used for your
vitality, for your health,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:84%
for your creativity,
for your expression,

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and your purpose on the planet.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And taking responsibility.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you've cleared
the stuff out

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and you've recognized
what you're here to do.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you get far
enough along in your path

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to recognize you're here
for something very specific.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
We each have a unique
strength that we're

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.030 align:middle line:90%
bringing to this planet.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:90%
That requires responsibility.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.800 align:middle line:90%
A huge responsibility.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's nice
to not know what

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.491 align:middle line:84%
you're here to do because
then you don't have to do it.

00:45:57.491 --> 00:45:59.391 align:middle line:84%
Right?
I mean I hear this--

00:45:59.391 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes.
But you know what--

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid to know what I'm
here to do because-- I've

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.650 align:middle line:90%
heard people say this.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Because then it means
I have to change.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have to let
go of some stuff--

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that don't support
me-- but I feel like them.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.899 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Ha ha.

00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We're probably all a little
bit familiar with that one.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.540 align:middle line:84%
The next one is-- and I'm
not bringing all of them

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
up because there are too many--
but the next one is "trust."

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:84%
You know trusting other
people, trusting self--

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to say this for me

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual point
of view-- ultimately

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:84%
it's about trusting
the universe.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Trusting your
spiritual connection.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.144 align:middle line:90%
That you are careful.

00:46:43.144 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when these things
have happened to you,

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
somehow we relate it to the
fact that we weren't taken care

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.450 align:middle line:84%
of by the universe,
by spirit, by God--

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:50.870 align:middle line:90%
whatever you choose to call it.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that that seed of lack
of trust goes into everything.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And how do you start
reprogramming that part?

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
someone who is disconnected,

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:10.430 align:middle line:84%
who's blaming the
universe, God-- whatever--

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.320 align:middle line:90%
for their circumstance.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:84%
To start opening up and
trusting in the fact

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.811 align:middle line:84%
that the fabric of the universe
is essentially non-judgement

00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:20.385 align:middle line:84%
and love?
It's there for you.

00:47:20.385 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:84%
You can build what
you want from it.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:84%
You can make it
beautiful or ugly.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You know what, you
start by teaching

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.700 align:middle line:90%
them to trust themselves.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:84%
By keeping their own
agreements with themselves.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.100 align:middle line:84%
By keeping their word
with other people.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.660 align:middle line:84%
You start small because
the universe is too big.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.831 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I can't
even deal with all of that.

00:47:39.831 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But most people who
are in those spaces

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
have a challenge
keeping their word.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Have a challenge
honoring the agreements

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that they've made with
themselves and with others.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And so you start there.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So you start learning that
you can trust yourself

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and then that becomes
an energetic magnet that

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.390 align:middle line:84%
brings in other people and other
experiences that you can trust.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
fortunate because I

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:06.370 align:middle line:84%
was raised by parents that
were-- well, not perfect

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.890 align:middle line:90%
because no parents are perfect.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Nor are we as parents
perfect-- one thing they did

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:90%
was they did tell the truth.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:90%
They were very honest people.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And my father just has this
incredible level of integrity.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, even as a
teenager, one thing he said

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:84%
to me-- and he said it a couple
times again through life--

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle line:84%
he said, honey child--
he's from Texas-- he'd say,

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to lie
do it with someone else,

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.160 align:middle line:90%
but don't ever lie to yourself.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't suggesting lying.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:84%
He was saying one
of the worst sins--

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.950 align:middle line:84%
so to speak-- you can create
is to lie to yourself.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.770 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And how self-delusional
can we be?

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
are witnessing it all

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.940 align:middle line:90%
over this world with certain--

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Look at the political
structure alone.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.950 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to
do, by way of lying

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, to
perpetuate the insanity

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that's going on right now?

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Keeping us right on
the verge of war.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Or not on the verge of it--
justifying, rationalizing.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to convince ourselves,
as the population at large,

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that what these people are
convincing their selves of

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can justify and
rationalize these things.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:90%
This whole thing.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.041 align:middle line:84%
But it shows you the
power of the mind.

00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if they can work
on that end of the spectrum

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.321 align:middle line:84%
it can work on the healthy
end of the spectrum.

00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:35.010 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-And what you choose.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And how you choose to be.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:37.920 align:middle line:90%
And what you choose to create.

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose to
live your authentic self.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how
uncomfortable it

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is, even ugly at
times, like daddy says,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:47.370 align:middle line:90%
don't ever lie to yourself.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't lie to yourself.
Right.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't have
the tools to change it,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:84%
just to recognize the truth I
see that as huge in anyone's

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.520 align:middle line:84%
path to healing.
-Yes.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that
some kind of portals

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.240 align:middle line:84%
open and people and
experiences come in to support

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.020 align:middle line:84%
you taking the next step.
-Yes.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Recognition of truth.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And having, and then
having-- then you can

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:84%
start having your
trust in the universe.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.440 align:middle line:90%
OK "Invest."

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Investment of what kind?
-Yeah.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You know a lot of times when
we think of investment we

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:90%
think of it as financial.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What are we investing
our money in?

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But I guess I want to
say to people, what are

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.680 align:middle line:90%
you investing your energy in?

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:84%
What are you investing
your conversation in?

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:84%
What are you investing
your way of being in?

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean are you-- are
you putting your love,

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
your peace, the harmonic
aspects of yourself--

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.200 align:middle line:90%
are you investing them?

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Or are you perpetuating
that thing that you hate?

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you are you talking about
these things and these peoples

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
as enemies, when in fact you
are seeing the same field

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.780 align:middle line:90%
that you dislike.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:58.930 align:middle line:84%
What are you investing in
in your thoughts, words,

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.240 align:middle line:90%
deeds, actions and behaviors?

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Where you put your
energy is going

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:84%
to be dictating the quality
of your life experience.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.330 align:middle line:84%
-"Singing." it says "sing."
-Yes!

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.403 align:middle line:84%
And this is near and dear
to you, you're a singer.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I am a singer Well, you know
what-- we all have a song.

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:19.590 align:middle line:84%
We all have a rhythm, and
a rhyme, an end and an

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:90%
energetic pattern-- and use it.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's through music,
or whether it's writing,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.610 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's painting,
or raising your children,

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
or caring for animals--
do it full out.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, dance your dance.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Well there are many more.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even get into
"change," and "gratitude,"

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:90%
and many others.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But again, I mean anyone can
pick up a copy of the book

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and start diving in and working
on yourself through the book.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a genuine gift to
anyone that's looking to really

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.940 align:middle line:84%
break past some
of the old stories

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.000 align:middle line:90%
we've been telling ourselves.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of the lies we've been
telling ourselves as well.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
stopping at this point,

00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.870 align:middle line:84%
even though we have
a few more minutes

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is because there's
something else

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:84%
going on that you're
involved with called

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.500 align:middle line:90%
The Global Blessing.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have about
five minutes left.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Give us the idea for
the inspiration of it,

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.420 align:middle line:90%
what you're hoping to achieve?

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on with that?

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot through
social media.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.920 align:middle line:10%
And I began to
witness the amount

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.010 align:middle line:10%
of discomfort, dissatisfaction,
and complaining that goes on.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:10%
And I said, you know you're
either part of the solution

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.260 align:middle line:10%
or you're a part
of the challenge.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And so I began to
just ask, what is it

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:10%
that could make a difference?

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:36.540 align:middle line:10%
And it came to me-- blessings.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.450 align:middle line:10%
That we can invite people all
over the world to come and do

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:43.840 align:middle line:10%
blessings and bring
blessings for every aspect

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:10%
of this planet-- those things
we love and those things

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:10%
we don't like.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And so I created the
global blessing blog.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And anybody-- my intention
is to have 50,000 people post

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.250 align:middle line:84%
blessings from September
22 to December 21,

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:58.690 align:middle line:90%
the end of the Mayan calendar.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:04.780 align:middle line:10%
And to really put that energy
as a container-- a vortex

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.000 align:middle line:10%
of health, and well
being, and love,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.030 align:middle line:10%
and peace-- out into the world.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:10%
So we become the
alternative voice.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And so how do people
participate in it?

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.430 align:middle line:84%
They go to a
globalblessingblog.com

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and they register.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It's free, it doesn't
cost anything.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And the only thing is they have
to sign an agreement that they

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.740 align:middle line:10%
will only post blessings.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So far have you had any
abuse in your postings

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.420 align:middle line:84%
or has it all gone
really smoothly?

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone really smoothly.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.781 align:middle line:84%
So people are
resonating with it.

00:53:32.781 --> 00:53:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And I'm so excited about it.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.080 align:middle line:10%
Because there are people
from all over the world

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.810 align:middle line:10%
that are doing it.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I believe that
there is power in the word.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And by using that
energy in a powerful way

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:47.720 align:middle line:90%
we can shift consciousness.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.780 align:middle line:90%
We can indeed.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about this

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm being reminded
of other projects.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.551 align:middle line:84%
Other large projects as well,
like the Global Coherence

00:53:55.551 --> 00:53:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Project.
-Yes.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And what-- I think it's
really important to understand

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is the power that you
talked about of the mind.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Where you start bringing groups
and numbers of people together

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:90%
reinforcing each other.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that we have
an impact on-- impacting

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.330 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in each other.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.160 align:middle line:84%
This has the potential
to impact land masses.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't, I think,
understand as a species

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that the emotional bodies
surrounding us, the mind of us,

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is interpenetrated with
the mind of the planet.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And interpenetrating with
the mind of the cosmos.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:84%
We're all going through
this magnificent journey.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.970 align:middle line:84%
March toward 2012 when we
birth ourselves into a new era

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:42.670 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:45.710 align:middle line:84%
The earth is going through her
own stress points right now.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And the more attention,
and love, and nurturing

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that we bring, the easier
it is for the earth--

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:84%
to have her-- transition in
a way that is supportive.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.455 align:middle line:90%
And that is not woo woo.

00:54:59.455 --> 00:55:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Howard Martin
is working on setting

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:04.210 align:middle line:84%
up sensors around the planet.
-I know.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:05.085 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that crazy?

00:55:05.085 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing that
and they're saying,

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.700 align:middle line:90%
yes-- they can see.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're fully expecting to
start seeing a pattern here.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.640 align:middle line:84%
That where people in
a given land mass area

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.790 align:middle line:84%
change their emotions and
minds, and do this in harmony

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:23.060 align:middle line:84%
with one another,
they're expecting

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to see a reductiom--
not only in crime,

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean that John
Hegland's work went

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.250 align:middle line:84%
into all of that-- but
even Earth activity

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of along
fault lines and such.

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.390 align:middle line:84%
That's how seriously
they're taking this project.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:39.070 align:middle line:84%
-It's all interconnected.
-Yes.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is a way
scientifically to show

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.350 align:middle line:90%
us the impact of coherence.

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And as above so below.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have time
for that conversation

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.200 align:middle line:84%
but it is very
much quite literal

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.720 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in the cosmos.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Well it's this pressure
that the society at large

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.200 align:middle line:90%
is feeling is very real.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the kind
of work you're talking about,

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.080 align:middle line:84%
about cutting each other
a little bit of slack,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and being compassionate,
and showing

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.461 align:middle line:84%
that really showing up for
one another is key right now.

00:56:07.461 --> 00:56:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Because that might be
the very thing we need.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.230 align:middle line:90%
We're going to need each other.

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Any final comment?

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.420 align:middle line:90%
We just have a few seconds left.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I want the people
looking at this program

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
amazing they are.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And how necessary and essential.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And that there would
be a hole without them.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And that together
we can shift things.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:31.450 align:middle line:84%
There is light at the end
of the tunnel and it is us.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is not New Age talk.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.230 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be
hard, cold, reality.

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Or warm, soft, fuzzy, reality.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
so much for being with us.

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:42.919 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:56:42.919 --> 00:56:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see you too.
Thank you.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful.
Beautiful.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.990 align:middle line:84%
