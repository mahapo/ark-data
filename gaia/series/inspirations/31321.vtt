00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:84%
According to the Census
Bureau, 78 million households

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
currently have children

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
under the age of 18
years old living at home.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So even if you have
nieces or nephews,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
or if you'd like to take a look
back at your own childhood,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:84%
would you like to know what
it would be like to parent

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:90%
without power struggles?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we're
talking about today

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
with licensed marriage
and family therapist

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and credentialed teacher
Susan Stiffelman with over 25

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
years of experience teaching
and lecturing and parenting

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
about the lessons from
her book "Parenting

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Without Power Struggles."

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSAN STIFFELMAN:
Thanks, Lisa.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.576 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you here.

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I was just discussing with
you if it was easy to do this,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.452 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't need books
and tapes and information

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
on how to parent
without power struggles.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we were mostly
parented that way, right?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.373 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
We were mostly parented
with "because I said so,"

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
kids taking their misbehavior
or their naughty behavior

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
underground or being sneaky,
because the parents were so

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
in their face and so assertive
or aggressive about controlling

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:90%
what they did.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most people would
call that discipline.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.281 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
discipline's great.

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all about
parents owning the role.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I call it being the
captain of the ship.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely
believe that parents

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
need to be the one in charge.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's different
from being in control.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Power struggles happen when
you're jockeying for position

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
or you're trying to maintain
some semblance of control,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.624 align:middle line:84%
which our parents
were largely about.

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And also,
I mean, children

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
are trying to
become independent.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you give
them permission to do that?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.691 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I just want to say,
first of all, that this is not

00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
something that everybody will
get right 100% of the time,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
because of what
you just explained.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.296 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Exactly.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I, as a parent,
love the principles,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
adhere to most of them.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
But I need to also
not beat myself up

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
if I fall off the wagon or do
something that was, you know,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.892 align:middle line:90%
from my childhood.

00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
think is the biggest

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:90%
mistake that parents make?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:90%
One of them.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.828 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh, gosh.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
biggest mistakes

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that parents make is
being afraid to parent,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
being fearful of their
kids, not owning the role

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that their children
most need them

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to inhabit, which is-- I call
it the captain of the ship.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to say what's the
biggest mistake, first of all,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
you said something
earlier about being right.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And I throw that away.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Because there is no right.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And even when
we think about a mistake,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
biggest challenge might

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
be that we don't
understand how essential it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
is for our children and
the happiness of our home

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
to actually inhabit that
role of being in charge,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
even if it comes at
the cost of our kids

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
not liking us or being
upset or not being happy

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:84%
or those things that
we try to avoid,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
because they just
don't feel good.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your perspective
is to be the captain,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:90%
to be in charge--

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.802 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --to not be the friend,
best friend of your child.

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yep, yep.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.522 align:middle line:84%
I tell parents, make sure
you have other friends.

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going
to be a lot of days

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:84%
when your children
don't consider you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
one of the theirs,
best or another one.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about when you have
only children, when you're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
your child's mother and
sometimes sister and friend?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You know,
from having spoken with you,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.489 align:middle line:84%
you have a really
sweet relationship

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
with your daughter.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.049 align:middle line:84%
And I have a great
relationship with my son

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
who's about to
graduate from college.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
He's 22.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And he's an only child.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's trickier sometimes when
it's just that one child.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
There aren't siblings around
to sort of share the spotlight.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:90%
But of course it can be done.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It means still that
there are going

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
to be times when your daughter
just doesn't like you.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to allow for that
in favor of being buddy-buddy

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN:
--making sure that she

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.257 align:middle line:84%
feels that you're
really her chum.

00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:09.215 align:middle line:84%
She needs to have her
friends, age appropriate.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:90%
And you need to have yours.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.478 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a balance.

00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the mothers that I speak
to who have multiple children,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.259 align:middle line:84%
their biggest complaint is the
fighting between the children.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so we're going
to address that in a second.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But let's start off
with the main principal.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: OK.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few basic
elements of my work

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that seem to make sense
and one in particular

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:90%
that's very visual.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'll show it to you.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So this right hand is going
to represent the parent.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.091 align:middle line:84%
And my left hand
represents the child.

00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So the
right hand on top.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.705 align:middle line:84%
I have my bracelet on
the child hand today.

00:04:40.705 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.746 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So this is the
captain of the ship position.

00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The child might say, I really
want to go to the mall at 9:00

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
tonight to see this really
cool movie with my friends.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.166 align:middle line:90%
And she's 11, let's say.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think
that's a good idea.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So you, as captain, would
see the big picture,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.125 align:middle line:84%
the storm that you
might sail into here.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
sweetheart, I'm

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
afraid that's not going
to work out for tonight.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.966 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Now,
here's where it's

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
going to get-- nobody in
charge in this position.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not safe.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Sweetie, it's not.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.415 align:middle line:90%
9 o'clock, the mall is--

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you're negotiating.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
You're arguing.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: The
daughter's going to say,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
you treat me like a baby.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's in charge here.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.501 align:middle line:90%
And I call this the two lawyers.

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
this is what you said.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
There's negotiating.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:90%
There's jockeying for position.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
There's pushing
and pushing back.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And then it can get worse.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I had a coaching call today
with someone on the east coast.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.084 align:middle line:84%
And this is where she was
down below with her daughter

00:05:37.084 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
announcing something
she was going

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to do with or
without permission.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the mall, then
your daughter says, I hate you.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even
eating my dinner

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
or doing my homework,
your 11-year-old.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:90%
You're down here.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: The way you
know you're down here--

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and I call this the dictator--

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.289 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --is that you're
bribing and threatening.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying to
force your daughter

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to do what you want
so you can feel

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
you're back in
control, back on top.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.106 align:middle line:84%
And inside, you feel
desperate and out of control.

00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And so
here's where you're pushing

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.149 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
assert some authority.

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going
to work, because--

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's where,
I'll give you $1.

00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:15.191 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking
whatever lesson this week.

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Been there.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.818 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It
comes from down here.

00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:18.317 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:18.317 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know that really well.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: We all do.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.895 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I wrote the book, and
I still have my challenges.

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good to know.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Or did.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.111 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You literally
wrote the book.

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I mean,
he's now in college.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that when you
captain the ship, energetically

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:90%
you own the role.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
You're calm.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:90%
You're confident.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that if
you were a passenger ship

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.306 align:middle line:84%
and the alarm went off
on the ship, you know,

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
woop, woop, woop, you
don't want your captain

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
leaping over the side of the
ship like the guy did in Italy.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.333 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: RIght.

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
want the captain who

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that you're in a
problem, you've hit an iceberg,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and handles it.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So when the child's
upset, ideally-

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and we're all aiming for
this-- you hold this place.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of ways
that I teach that we do that.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So that no matter what she
puts at you or what storm she's

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of, you
help her through it.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm just
going to assert to say this.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We are not in charge that
much in our own lives

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:90%
even without being parents.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, how
many times are you

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
in charge of your life in full
empowerment throughout your day

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.784 align:middle line:84%
with conversations with people
in line, or at the bank,

00:07:23.784 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:90%
or with your family members.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN:
Right, right, right.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.221 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, usually
we lose that power.

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
said earlier this is

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:90%
a conversation across the board.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.901 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you assert
that type of power?

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well,
there's a lot about it.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The first is that, you know,
put your hands up for a minute.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I want
to show you something.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we were standing up and
I started to push against you,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Push back.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can sort of see
that we're doing that.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Human instinct is
to push against that

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
which pushes against us.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:90%
We're wired to resist coercion.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.627 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, resistance.

00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.362 align:middle line:84%
So when you come at a
child, not because you're

00:07:57.362 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
captaining your ship,
but because you're either

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
down here in lawyer
mode or down here

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
feeling desperate in dictator
mode, you will come at her.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And her instinct will be
to resist or to push back.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing is that instinct

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.907 align:middle line:84%
to resist being bossed around
is actually a good thing.

00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.865 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say, so isn't
this freedom, independence--

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.172 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:08:19.172 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --hero's
journey, whatever it is.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well, it's that.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.362 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
survival mechanism.

00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, that I
believe we're meant

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to raise our
children in a tribe.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in a tribe and
your three-year-old wanders

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
off to the perimeter,
you want her

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to say no if a stranger
says come with me

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.961 align:middle line:90%
and to run back to who?

00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.719 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: To you, the person
to whom he or she is attached.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Safest, yeah.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So the way
we override this instinct

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to push and push back or
resist is through attachment.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So at some point today, I'd
love to go over these stages

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that the child moves
through in the first six

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
years of their life,
becoming more and more deeply

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:90%
attached to you.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It's one element
that helps position

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
you to captain the ship.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it instinctively
helps your child

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.847 align:middle line:84%
want to take direction from
you rather than resist it.

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Is this what is called
attachment parenting

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:90%
or different?

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's an element.

00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's a
little bit different.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a full-blown,
everything by the book.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
that when we have

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
a loving and close
connection with our children,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
when they feel
that we like them,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
when they know that we
see who they are not

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
because of what they have
accomplished or achieved

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
or even how they've behaved,
but we get who they are

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.347 align:middle line:90%
and I love it.

00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: When
they feel that there

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.258 align:middle line:84%
are things that they have in
common with us, when they feel

00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
we're on their side, they are
more predisposed to going along

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
with the plan, whatever
it is you suggest.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.578 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I'm
glad you said that.

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Because there are extremes
of every movement out there.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
This is not the extreme of the
attachment parenting movement.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:90%
This is about balance.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I also like what
you said because when

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
you give a child too many
choices at a young age

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and too much freedom
at a young age, then

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.062 align:middle line:90%
they don't really understand.

00:09:59.062 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're emotionally

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.567 align:middle line:90%
able to make that many choices.

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Great point.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I mean, I don't know.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: No, yeah.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm asking, kind of.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.963 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I would
agree with that.

00:10:07.963 --> 00:10:11.729 align:middle line:84%
And that's where many parents
now, especially parents

00:10:11.729 --> 00:10:13.395 align:middle line:84%
that are doing yoga,
they're meditating,

00:10:13.395 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
they want this to be
part of their sort

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual practice
or conscious living--

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --it's
a little hazy.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's
a little unclear

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:90%
about where that line is.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you do
recognize your child

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
is and equally respectable
being on the same par with you.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the deal going on,
the contract, the relationship

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
that you have with that child
for a period of at least

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
a few years, is to sort of
manage and oversee and help

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.837 align:middle line:90%
them avoid the storms of life.

00:10:39.837 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.366 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've been on
both sides of that.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've asked my
four-year-old at one point,

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.919 align:middle line:84%
so we're at a restaurant,
what do you want?

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.309 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She has no clue.

00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's OK though.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what I wound
up doing was realizing,

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:90%
oh, here's three choices.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.625 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: There-- yeah.

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:57.927 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Choose that rather
than look at the 75 pages

00:10:57.927 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:90%
on the menu and tell you--

00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.739 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's definitely
trial and error with parenting.

00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've gone through
this idea of this power

00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
struggle and how we lose our
power and how we could gain.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you do that?

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.097 align:middle line:84%
How do you assert power without
being domineering and hate it?

00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first is that
you fortify connection

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:90%
through attachment.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
When I get a phone call-- and I
do mostly phone coaching now--

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
or I do a talk and somebody
poses the question my kid won't

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
do anything I ask,
won't listen to me,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
deliberately doesn't put on
shoes when I ask even if he was

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
about to put them
on before I asked,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I will ask for the temperature
of the relationship.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go through these
stages of attachment

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, where it is
strong and where is it weak?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So usually a child's
misbehavior I

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
see as sort of a flashing
neon sign saying something

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is not healthy or strong in
the connection or relationship.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only piece.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.015 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to being
captain than just attachment

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:58.081 align:middle line:90%
and connection.

00:11:58.081 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly going
to be one of the pieces

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
that I start with.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where a need
is not fulfilled?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Where the child
is constantly and chronically

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
defiant, I'm always
going to look

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
at does the child feel
that the parent likes them.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the
thing, you know as a mom,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and you work, and
you're really busy,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.357 align:middle line:84%
that it's easy to set it
up so that every time you

00:12:18.357 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
walk in the room,
your daughter thinks

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to ask
her to do something.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I call it being
lost to the list.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.411 align:middle line:84%
So from the time our kids
get up in the morning,

00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:90%
you want to get them up.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a feat in itself
for some families.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.048 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Then you want
clothes on their body and socks

00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and shoes, and food in their
stomach, and the backpack,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and on and on it goes.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they come home, and
you sort of go in reverse.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a shower
and bath and bedtime.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And homework.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.266 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And the
whole focus of your life

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
becomes getting these
things checked off.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And our kids resent that.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They know that life is about
more than checking things off

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:90%
the list.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, they're our
great teachers in that way.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Their goal in
life is to have fun pretty much

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
every minute that
they possibly can.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:56.365 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And so
they see you coming.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And outside of a loving and
sweet friendly connection

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.162 align:middle line:90%
they figure, oh, god.

00:13:03.162 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:90%
What does she want now?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
they're already like--

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when my daughter
says, mom, can I play?

00:13:07.885 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.459 align:middle line:90%
Were we not playing?

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:13.958 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.795 align:middle line:90%
That's a rough one.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like, busted.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.245 align:middle line:90%
But it's such a balance.

00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:90%
It's such a dance.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
keep saying that.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.889 align:middle line:84%
So electronics seems to
be another entire person

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:90%
in the family these days.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's
a good way to put it.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.984 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
ever-present.

00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
to get captivated.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
We, when we were kids, didn't
have the emotional aspects

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that kids have to
deal with today with Facebook

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.471 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that they're
connected with, and Instagram

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.269 align:middle line:84%
How do you suggest
monitoring that?

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.677 align:middle line:90%
Boy, it's a whole huge topic.

00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I call it a house on fire.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually helped launch a site
on the "Huffington Post" called

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Screen Sense based
on this conversation

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and the conversation
around the need

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that parents are having in
terms of how do we do this?

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we're on
this runaway train.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And nobody was prepared.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And none of us really know
at what age should she

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
have a Facebook pagem abd
how often should she post?

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Should I monitor it?

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
There aren't any quick
and easy answers.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the places
where-- when I give a talk,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll say to parents don't
believe anything I say.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.626 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to be--
yes, I'm called an expert.

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But you're the
expert ultimately.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And so this
is one of those places where

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.135 align:middle line:84%
I really invite and
encourage parents

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:90%
to check in with themselves.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:90%
What feels right to you?

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.001 align:middle line:90%
And then be fearless.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.583 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Be fearless.

00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:39.357 align:middle line:84%
Because if what
feels right to you,

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
for instance, is that
your daughter does not

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
have unmonitored, unbridled
access to a Facebook page,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
first of all, trust it.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, don't
expect other parents

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to do what you're doing.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
In that regard, you
can't lean on them.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It's great if you can have
a network of other support.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
But you may not.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
there's a great video

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that Susan's put together
about this particular issue.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Because it's an ongoing topic.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.822 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look.

00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Hi.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm Susan Stiffelman.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm the author of "Parenting
Without Power Struggles."

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Often, parents tell me that they
feel the screens in their homes

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:90%
have taken over.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's an uphill battle
just to get their kids

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to do their homework or
chores or even come to dinner.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Here are some things
that you can do.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:90%
First, be fearless.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It's your job to be
the captain of the ship

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and to establish guidelines that
are realistic and that work.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Most kids will spend
endless amounts of time

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:90%
unless you contain it.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So don't be afraid
if your kids don't

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:90%
like you or they get mad at you.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Second, turn everything off
at a predetermined time.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Just shut the router
off if you need to.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But tell your kids
what's going to happen

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
so they can get
their homework done.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Third, don't engage
in negotiations

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that only fuel
their frustration.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Please, one more
game, 30 more minutes.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
In the end, you just need
to be decisive and be clear.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Be compassionate and acknowledge
they want to keep going.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you say it's
over, it needs to be over.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Fourth, create alternatives,
outdoor activities,

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:90%
family games.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Spend time with your kids
doing fun things that

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
will make it more
attractive to be with you

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%

to stare at the screen.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Finally, take a look at
yourself and make sure

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're not modeling
behavior for your kids

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that they should
have unlimited use because you

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're reading, that
you're exercising, that you're

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
having regular
conversations so that they

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:90%
take their cues from you.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.282 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.282 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My daughter
actually got me

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
on that one, that last
one about how many times

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
when I pick her up from the
car and the phone would ring,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:90%
and I would answer it.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And granted, she's
been gone all day.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.517 align:middle line:90%
I pick her up at 3:00.

00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
She gets in the car,
ready and excited

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.141 align:middle line:90%
to tell me about her day.

00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'll answer the phone.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So she busted me on that
a good three years ago.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.605 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well done, her.

00:16:57.605 --> 00:16:58.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yup.

00:16:58.105 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And now
what are you doing?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.643 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
She was seven or
eight at the time.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
mom, get off your phone.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I needed to hear.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry it took me
that long to hear that.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But at 3 o'clock-- and
most of the people around

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
me know-- don't
call me after 3:00.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in the carpool line,
I'm done when I pick her up.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's off until 9:00.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Wow.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If there's
emergencies, of course.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
But I have really five hours
a day to have with her now.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.847 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so it's going

00:17:31.847 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: It is.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So I do that.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:90%
It is a tough one.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially,
I mean, conversations

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
are still in the
middle of things.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.183 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting to hear back from
people who can't reach me.

00:17:41.183 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gets really--
the conversations

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:90%
are still going on in my head.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.601 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I switch the
focus to her intentionally.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.343 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: But think about
what your modeling for her

00:17:51.343 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how she's
going to use her devices.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Or at least you're
giving her a fair chance

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.159 align:middle line:84%
to know internally that when
she's engaged constantly--

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
let's say she's sitting with
friends or grandma's there

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.372 align:middle line:84%
and her phone keeps
beeping and bopping,

00:18:04.372 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
that she's got a picture in her
head of a different way this

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
would look, which
is that she's all

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the way present with
whoever she's with.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.443 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:18:13.443 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And other things will
come through her texts

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that she'll ignore that I've
seen that she's ignored.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Fantastic.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.361 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But, OK,
what about that idea

00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
of reading your child's texts
if they're teenagers even?

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well,
there's a 13-year-old

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.391 align:middle line:90%
and there's a 17-year-old.

00:18:28.391 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Big range.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So with
a 17-year-old, so much

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of this with an older kid
and with younger, too,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:84%
again, you're going to be
checking in with yourself.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
If you have a funny
feeling, listen to it.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Follow it.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And certainly don't be afraid
of your kid not liking you

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
or being mad or
telling you you are

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
the meanest mom or the nosiest
mom or the most controlling

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
mom, or the most overprotective
mom in the world.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN:
We've all heard it.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of the deal.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But they have privacy.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
At what point do you
allow just the privacy

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and their own
relationships to build?

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's a
very personal question.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
based more on who

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
your child is,
who you recognize.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that
they are trustworthy?

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Are they in a position in
the rest of their lives,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
showing up in a mature way,
to manage conversations

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:90%
appropriately.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly
say now and then

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see my
14-year-old's texts.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I definitely don't think I would
give carte blanche depending

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
on the 15-year-old.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:90%
17 are less likely.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But if there was
something amiss,

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
if I felt like he or she
was locked in his room

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
all the time-- let's say
he was locked in his room,

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:84%
not making eye
contact, hanging out

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.696 align:middle line:84%
with kids who never
came to the house.

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I probably would say,
you know, I'm not

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.297 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with what it feels
like you're going through.

00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to really
look at your phone.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm paying for it, and
I'd like to have a look.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:44.959 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:47.909 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And then you'll
know a lot by their reaction.

00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, this
is a whole topic

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that goes into at what
point do you find out

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:90%
if your child is having sex.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I can't tell
throw you any curve balls.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
You've heard it all.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But at what point do
you ask that question?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.339 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something that's
a parent's business?

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:90%
How do you approach that?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.898 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
know, again, this

00:20:08.898 --> 00:20:10.186 align:middle line:90%
is so built on a few things.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
One is on the connection
that you have.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So the stages of
attachment, if you imagine

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that this is the tree and
these are the roots, right?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.313 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And this comes
from Gordon Neufeld's work.

00:20:19.313 --> 00:20:20.925 align:middle line:84%
The entry point
or the first place

00:20:20.925 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
where the attachment journey
begins for the newborn

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:90%
is proximity.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the touch, smell, sound,
contact, very physical.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: The second--
I'm skimming through these.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's important.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.433 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I go into
them in depth later.

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But the second
stage is sameness,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
where the child, the
two-year-old, learns language.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Because he wants to be
like you, mimicking you.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: They
want to be like you.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
The third stage is
belonging or loyalty.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The three-year-old can
be very possessive.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They push their
sibling off your lap.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:90%
My mommy.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.517 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:20:48.517 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's
around the age of three

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
as attachment deepens.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The fourth stage
is significance.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
The child feels seen and
cherished by you as is.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.353 align:middle line:84%
You know, I love your
laugh sweetheart.

00:21:00.353 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Nobody tells
a joke the way you do.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
The fifth stage is love.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going even
deeper, those roots.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's just this
unadulterated, uncomplicated

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:90%
transmission of love.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Not sweetie I love you,
did you do your homework?

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:90%
But just--

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Giggly fun.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: --god, I love you.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.916 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
the final stage,

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
if all has gone well with
these stages, is being known.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:90%
It's from six on.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is the child who
tells you her secrets.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So to have that
kind of child who

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
will tell you I'm
thinking of having sex

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
with my 14-year-old
boyfriend, you

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
want to have a strong connection
in all of these areas.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't just get to
jump in when a child is 17

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
and say, tell me everything.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we often
teach our children

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
not to do that very
thing by the way

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
we react instead of respond
when they hit the wall.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
get that back if you

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:84%
are hearing this
for the first time?

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
can get that back.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can't?

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: So absolutely.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
You know, I used to write--

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.869 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Absolutely,
you can, C-A-N.

00:21:55.869 --> 00:21:56.451 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.001 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: For two
years, I wrote the Ask

00:21:59.001 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the Therapist column
for grandparents.com.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was addressing questions
from parents every week

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:90%
who were in their '60s and '70s.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's no expiration date
on connecting and attaching.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And then what do you say to
the 14-year-old or the 11

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever year old
that wants to have sex?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So you do this
in the smaller ways first.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Children will test you.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:84%
They might say, you
know, I actually

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
got a D on my test, that test
that you cared a lot about,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:90%
mommy.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And by the way we
respond-- or react,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I should say-- you did what?

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:90%
You didn't study after all?

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
You have now taught your child
don't tell mommy the truth.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, I teach something in
my work called Act I parenting.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.419 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do a
demonstration if you want.

00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
In Act I parenting, you're
coming alongside the child

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:90%
rather than at.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
I have this nifty hand motion.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.872 align:middle line:90%
I like the visuals.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.538 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Instead
of coming at with,

00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:90%
how could you have gotten a D?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I reviewed
it with you.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You told me you were
studying for it.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
You would be coming alongside.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.447 align:middle line:90%
So should I--

00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Saying, yes?

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --run
it through with you?

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, go ahead.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: All right.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
So let me back up for a second.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Act II is what most of us do
when a child has a complaint.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%
And maybe we can role play this.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
can be a child.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And you're
going to make a complaint.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to start by
doing what most parents do,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:84%
which is Act II
parenting, where I'm

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
going to be appealing to your
left, logical, word-based,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
language-based rational brain
with suggestions and advice

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to feel better, so I can hurry
up and make you feel better.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:33.151 --> 00:23:33.858 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: OK.

00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
So what's your complaint?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I got a D
on my reading test.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You got a D.
Honey, didn't you try at all?

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I studied!

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I studied!

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.854 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: I know.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I saw
that you were studying

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and you were texting
your friends.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.672 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, you can't do that.

00:23:49.672 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I do
it all the time.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.005 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: I know.

00:23:52.005 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But you got a D. And
that's not the first D.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to talk about this.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So we'll pause.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.972 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: How is this
going in the parenting?

00:23:58.972 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:90%
How do you as the child feel?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounding familiar.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.772 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So that was
this, push, push back.

00:24:03.772 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Struggle.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.188 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: OK.

00:24:05.188 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So in Act I, which
prepares the child for you

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to actually come in and
offer real captain parenting

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
stuff, pearls of wisdom, you're
taking things down a notch.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
You're responding
instead of reacting.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You're slowing it down.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:90%
You're not wordy.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Because
you're not appealing

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:90%
to her left logical brain.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You're appealing to her
right emotional brain,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.381 align:middle line:90%
which is where she is right now.

00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.068 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So you're
not going to say a lot.

00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I talk about Act I
comments or responses

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
as being kind of
comic book language.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, oof,
darn, gosh, really?

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Pow.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.299 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Kind of neutral.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You're
trying to bring it down.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:90%
You're bringing her down.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
She's checking you
out, by the way.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to leave her
maybe scratching her head.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, wow, mommy
didn't say what I

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
thought she would say
here This is interesting.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.271 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking to
get at least three yeses.

00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.811 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And that
sounds a little formulaic.

00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But I get emails
every day from parents

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:90%
who are telling me this works.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.281 align:middle line:84%
So I like to make it really
simple and user friendly.

00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So look for
three nods or three yeses.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:90%
You'll watch me.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.998 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
questions or make comments

00:25:16.998 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that I pretty much know you're
going to have to say yes

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to just to make you more
receptive to what will follow,

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.571 align:middle line:90%
which would be my advice.

00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So make
the same complaint.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.826 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mom, I got
a D on my test.

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh, sweetie.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Boy, that's not really
what you expected, is it?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I studied.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So you were really
expecting that you'd better?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.182 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:37.182 --> 00:25:38.389 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's one yes.

00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I kind of didn't
understand this one part.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Ah, yeah.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So that part confused you.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.459 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I should have
asked the teacher.

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So
looking back, you're

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
thinking maybe
that was a time you

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:90%
might have gotten a little help?

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.489 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:50.489 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's two yeses.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Huh.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So are you maybe also
a little disappointed?

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, but I
was really thinking

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.482 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to
be disappointed, too.

00:26:05.482 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Ah, yeah.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.925 align:middle line:84%
So my reaction isn't
what you expected, huh?

00:26:08.925 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: All right.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm
agreeing. yeah.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I might have about what

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.281 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm more likely--
no guarantee--

00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could you say
maybe next time you could?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:35.842 align:middle line:90%
Or is that--

00:26:35.842 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: But
I'm always asking

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:90%
to be invited to the party.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Ah.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.664 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Would you want
to hear a couple of thoughts

00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I have about how it
might go differently

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: And if they say
no, that's fine for now.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.206 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Then
because I'm not

00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:84%
needy, which is-- when you're
down here, you're needy.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
"I need you to" are the worst
words to begin a request.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.398 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So when you're
down here, you're needy.

00:26:57.398 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
If I have this aroma of
authority and confidence

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:90%
as a captain--

>>LISA: I get the

00:27:03.975 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%

need you to want my
great suggestions,

00:27:07.677 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
then there's a much greater
likelihood that you'll

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
say, yeah, mom, what do you
think I could have done?

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm shoving it down your
throat, crashing the party,

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:90%
you're going to say no.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a parent
that would invite a child

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to tell them secrets or
what's going on at school

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.954 align:middle line:84%
or even if a child's being
bullied or humiliated.

00:27:26.954 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Exactly.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.778 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
don't know about it

00:27:29.778 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
until it shows up

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's another
really, really good piece

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that Susan has done
here on bullying.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.482 align:middle line:90%
This is a very hot topic.

00:27:39.482 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Hi.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm Susan Stiffelman.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm the author of "Parenting
Without Power Struggles."

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many
parents come to me

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
because their
children are bullied,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
what to do about it.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Here's some advice.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
First, encourage
your child to learn

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
how to avoid
engaging with a bully

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
or showing signs of weakness
which keep them in the victim

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:90%
mode.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Those things would include
whining, crying, pouting,

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:90%
begging.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You want your child
to simply walk away,

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't feed
the bully's behavior.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Second, teach your child
verbal tools and body language

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:90%
that convey assertiveness.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:90%
No!

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Back off!

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Stop bugging me!

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Help the child be empowered
and stand up for himself.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Third, talk with your child's
teacher if things escalate,

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:84%
so that you can set up a
meeting with the bully and/or

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
their parents and establish
clear, firm consequences

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
so the behavior
does not continue.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Finally, allow your child
to offload with you,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
express anxiety, fear,
have a cry if necessary,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't bring all
that emotional turmoil to them

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:90%
to school.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And they can then be more
empowered and assertive

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.739 align:middle line:84%
on the playground or wherever
the bullying is happening.

00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
happened to my daughter.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's happened to so
many people, where I just

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:84%
wanted to fight
her battle for her

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
so much rather than
giving her the tools

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:90%
to express it herself.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.349 align:middle line:90%
But she did not want me to.

00:29:13.349 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it would
have embarrassed her

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:84%
at home for a raging mom
to come in and take over.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And I respected that with her.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But what do you tell parents
who are on the fence that want

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to go in and take over
and those that don't?

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.638 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It depends on
what the nature of the bullying

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:32.835 align:middle line:90%
would be.

00:29:32.835 --> 00:29:33.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Situation.

00:29:33.584 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: If it's something
physical or below the belt--

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
if it's a little bit of
teasing, then you ideally

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
want to help empower your
child to learn to say,

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:90%
That's not nice.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't speak to me that way.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You want to help kids feel
that they have some resilience

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
If it's anything beyond
that-- and of course, it also

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
depends on the
age of the child--

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:84%
then with a young child, you
absolutely have to jump in.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There's no guarantee that
the school will act on--

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
as we've seen over and over
again-- on your child's behalf.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So ask for an authority?

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Go in and talk to an authority?

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Bring it up?

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Or in what way
would you jump in?

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:90%
What's the--

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well, it depends.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all
different, I know.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So if the
child's being bullied

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
on the playground,
being pushed around,

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.565 align:middle line:84%
things like that, then
you're going to come in

00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and say I want to talk
with you about what's

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
going on with my daughter
not in an accusational way.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You want to come across
as part of the team.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.289 align:middle line:84%
You want to assume that
they have your child's best

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:90%
interests at heart.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:84%
They just may not
be aware of it.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:84%
More and more schools now
are instituting programs

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.629 align:middle line:90%

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:84%
They have people coming

There's more awareness.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:90%
But it happens constantly.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
bullying at home

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%

strict and harsh

>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:06.359 align:middle line:84%
So with co-parenting-- and this
can also be true with parents

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:90%

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.165 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Or
you felt that it

00:31:46.165 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:84%
was yelling-- we'll do the
bullying-- that you felt

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that yelling was the only
way to get through to her.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what happened
in your household.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
you came out OK.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So do you see that we're
softening your partner

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a little more open?

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Because he's feeling or she's
feeling more understood.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:90%
You're showing some empathy.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I get that there are a lot
of times when yelling seems

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to be the only thing
that does work.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting with
a genuine friendliness.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Would you be willing to listen
to my feelings about that?

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been learning
new ways of parenting.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love for us to be
more aligned with each other

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:90%
if you're open.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But you're coming alongside;
you're not coming at.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're not parenting
the other parent,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.776 align:middle line:90%
which will not get you very far.

00:32:33.776 --> 00:32:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
very good point.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes to
doing homework and so forth,

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to get another parent
on the same page as you,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
going to happen.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But you can try in the ways that
you're speaking about, right?

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I mean, just
the homework issue alone is

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
something that you
have to constantly--

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.018 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:32:53.018 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's this.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's that our children
getting their homework

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
done-- until it's
done, we're anxious.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So we're down here.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're anxious or needy,
remember, you're down here.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So the child becomes
the means by which

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:90%
your anxiety will go away.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not until their homework
is done that you can then

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:90%
relax and feel competent again.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of manipulation
and pushing and prodding

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and cajoling to get it done,
so that you can feel better.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it also a
child's game to say,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
well, I know I'm
supposed to do homework,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote it down or I
know what I'm supposed to do.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.676 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to see how
far I can push the envelope.

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that maybe the case?

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: I call it mom TV.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's this thing
that I've invented

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that's called mom
TV, which is things

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.050 align:middle line:84%
aren't very interesting
right now, not much going on.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
show called mom TV.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.049 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly how
to get it going.

00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm going to do
my homework for a while, mommy.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.626 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know if I have any.

00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And then you're just, what?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.339 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's an On button.

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
now the show is on.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The Lisa show or that Janet
show, or whoever the parent is.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be less
invested and needy when

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:90%
it comes to this.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.655 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking you
might not do it?

00:34:06.655 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Boy.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Darn.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Pam.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a lot
of avenues you might go.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.659 align:middle line:84%
You might explore
with the teacher,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.513 align:middle line:84%
so that the relationship
or the contract

00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:84%
is much more between the
child and the teacher

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
than it is between
the two of you.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long have you
been coaching parents?

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you
considered a parent coach?

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Or are you a therapist?

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: I'm both.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Both.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I
do a lot of both.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.978 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of speaking.

00:34:28.978 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
write my weekly column

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:90%
for the "Huffington Post"

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is great.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I'm their parent
coach-- and a lot of events

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:90%
all over the world now.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
But still, the
coaching is where I've

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.471 align:middle line:90%
learned so much from one on one.

00:34:41.471 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Examples.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And in that situation,
what's the biggest

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:84%
reason why people
come to see you?

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh my gosh.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.159 align:middle line:84%
I think if I were
to sum it up, it

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.689 align:middle line:84%
would probably have to do with
kids not cooperating or doing

00:34:52.689 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:90%
what they're asked.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But then when they come to see
me for more serious issues,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.885 align:middle line:90%
the child is withdrawing.

00:34:57.885 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:90%
They're sullen.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:90%
They're depressed.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.404 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be in trouble.

00:35:00.404 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
They're pulling away.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.577 align:middle line:90%
Or they're very anxious.

00:35:02.577 --> 00:35:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something going on
in the family, in the household.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, these
are educated, loving,

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
you know, healthy,
sophisticated families.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not just--
we all need help.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:90%
I've turned to people for help.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I see myself in many ways, Lisa,
as the auntie in the village.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, that if we're meant
to raise our children together,

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:84%
it's really, as you know,
it's impossible for one or two

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:90%
people to do it on their own.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It is an impossible task.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And families are
so spread out these days

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.239 align:middle line:84%
in different states,
different countries sometimes.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely
a situation where

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.587 align:middle line:90%
you need to find the village.

00:35:34.587 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Or create it.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or create it.

00:35:37.211 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I'm a
big proponent of that.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I sort of see myself,
simply because I worked

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of families,
kids, and parents,

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:90%
I've learned a lot.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:90%
A lot comes through.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:84%
There's an intuition
that gets heightened

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:90%
or more accurate as you go.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in the case
where children are withdrawn

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
or in the situation
of anxiety or feeling

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
anxious about things, do
you have tips and techniques

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.869 align:middle line:90%
for that type of parenting?

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I do a
lot of work with that.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will always start, just
to mention a couple of things,

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.150 align:middle line:84%
with positioning
yourself as the one

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that the child feels
safe to turn to.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Many kids who I've worked
with who are quite depressed

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and/or anxious are afraid
of upsetting their parent.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they're afraid that their
parent's reaction, as opposed

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to response, will only
make things worse.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So I had a parent just
the other day coming in

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
with a very depressed teenager.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying
to get rah, rah.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%
You know, let's go exercise.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.259 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're depressed,
legitimately depressed,

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
energy to do that.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is a kid who's on
video games all day long.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And for the moment, that's
all that gives him comfort.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like his drug.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And so, yes.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, I would
say this is not a good idea.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
On the other, we
have to get in there

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and start to strengthen him
and give him an alternative.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I don't
know what might happen.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you
seeing an increase

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.942 align:middle line:90%
of children on antidepressants?

00:37:01.942 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: To some degree.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.191 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's difficult.

00:37:04.191 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because antidepressants
with children and teens

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.850 align:middle line:90%
is a risky business.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:12.925 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to finesse and
to get the medications right.

00:37:12.925 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
times, however,

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:90%
when they're very appropriate.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Even though I work a lot with, I
call it the ADD-ish population,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the real right-brain creative--

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, why?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.571 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I
don't like the label.

00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
a disorder, per se.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.855 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I don't think
it's a deficit, per se.

00:37:27.855 --> 00:37:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's sort of a
constellation of behaviors.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way
the brain is wired

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.769 align:middle line:84%
that can make life very
interesting and great.

00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it's a gift for me.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:36.130 align:middle line:90%
For me, too.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.489 align:middle line:84%
So I have had to learn
how to manage myself.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.655 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: But a
lot of these kids--

00:37:40.655 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:84%
there have been occasions
where I've said run,

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.554 align:middle line:84%
don't walk to get
this kid on something

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of
months, so he even

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.759 align:middle line:84%
knows how to sit in a chair
if it's very, very extreme.

00:37:49.759 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking, there
are a lot of alternative things

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:90%
that people can try.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But I also caution parents,
don't ignore your instincts.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
If your child needs
help, get help.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We can't manage everything
just by sitting quietly

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:90%
or being centered and talking.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.745 align:middle line:84%
But on the homework
issue, you can help them.

00:38:07.745 --> 00:38:08.703 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it starts with the--
so there's practical things.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the
things that I'll do

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.990 align:middle line:84%
with kids is-- because
this part of the brain,

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal cortex, is
responsible for staying

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:84%
on task, focused,
managing impulses,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and those sorts of things.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the brain
develops from back to front.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.882 align:middle line:84%
And this is the last to
mature or come on board.

00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Decision making is
the last to come on board?

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Decision
making, organization, right?

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Planning.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
executive function.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.411 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So when
you're asking a child

00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:40.870 align:middle line:84%
to start to do their
homework, you're

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.080 align:middle line:84%
really calling upon
their prefrontal cortex.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And for many kids, by 3:00
in the afternoon or 4:00,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:84%
if it hasn't been all day
kind of subdued and muted,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.686 align:middle line:90%
it is by then.

00:38:50.686 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I'll do with kids

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is I'll say, OK, how about
you do half this worksheet.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Then I want you to run around
the backyard three times,

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.747 align:middle line:84%
bring me four blades of
grass, sit down and sing

00:39:00.747 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
the "Happy Birthday
Song," and then do

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:90%
the second half of the page.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're probably thinking,
what did she just say?

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
But kids actually love this.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Because it wakes up their brain.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.682 align:middle line:90%
They're doing the work.

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But they're thinking,
how many blades of grass?

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:90%
What song am I supposed to sing?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you're lightening the
load, the mood a little bit.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're making it a
little bit more fun.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did that last night.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:84%
We played soccer in the house,
in the middle of homework.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, exactly.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Bravo.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was good,
til my husband got hurt.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.719 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.069 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
this video on homework.

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's hilarious.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:33.859 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm Susan Stiffelman.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm the author of "Parenting
Without Power Struggles."

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Often, parents ask me how can
I get my kids to do homework

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.370 align:middle line:84%
without meltdowns,
drama, and negotiations?

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you can do.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.090 align:middle line:84%
First, rule out any
legitimate reason

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that might cause your child
not to want to do the work.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
learning disability,

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:84%
a problem with the content or
understanding how to proceed,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:90%
or a challenge with the teacher.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Second, make sure
that your child's

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
had a healthy snack
and some down time,

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.990 align:middle line:84%
so that they're
fortified and ready to go

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
when it's time to
start their homework.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Third, avoid turning
on the TV or letting

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:84%
them play video games
just for a little while

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because that transition
is very difficult.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Leave those things until after
the homework has been finished.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Fourth, make sure that you
chunk down long assignments

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:90%
into more manageable units.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier for a child
to get started on homework

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
if they know they only
have work 7 to 10 minutes

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.515 align:middle line:84%
and they can see light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Finally, create a
comfortable, appealing place

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:90%
where they can do their work.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
That might be a comfy chair or
a nice fragrance in the air.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But make it a place
where they can focus,

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.855 align:middle line:84%
and they can relax
and stay on task.

00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again, very good tips,
things you can try at home.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.208 align:middle line:84%
Another topic is--
I got my list here.

00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.583 align:middle line:84%
I have so many
things to ask you.

00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about spanking?

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Big in our day,
when we were kids.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.365 align:middle line:90%
What about these days?

00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: People still
spank their children.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a shame, because
it compromises, remember,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:90%
the stages of attachment.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
What overrides a child's
resistance and works

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is to have a strong,
loving connection.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking,
children will

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
cooperate when they feel
seen, liked, enjoyed,

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.550 align:middle line:90%
all those things.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Now, that's
not across the board.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
There are kids who
have impulse problems.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen that there are so
many alternatives to spanking,

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that it's not really necessary.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And it usually comes from here.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.326 align:middle line:84%
It usually comes from a
parent who's hurt, angry--

00:41:37.326 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lost control.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --feeling
disrespected, lost control,

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:90%
feeling desperate.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So it does not
convey to the child

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that somebody is
calmly in charge.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
scary for the child.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying terrifying.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But kids, really, if you can
stay here as much as possible,

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:90%
then why not?

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.875 align:middle line:84%
If other approaches work,
then why not use them?

00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And my personal philosophy
is that it breaks the trust

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
completely with the
child and a parent.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That one who loves and
who touches and hugs also

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:90%
hits and spanks.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It breaks a trust barrier.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It really, for some reason,
severs something intuitively

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And by the same token, so does
you're lazy, you're a brat.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.637 align:middle line:84%
If your words are violent
towards your children--

00:42:29.637 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great point.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --then it
can mute to some degree,

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps lessen the impact, of

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:90%
of course you're amazing.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.612 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what if you
lose it as a parent?

00:42:39.612 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: You will.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You know?

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And yes.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:84%
When you lose it as a parent,
how do regain that trust?

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you rebuild?

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:90%
How do you take it back?

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:48.554 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:42:48.554 --> 00:42:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: You apologize.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You apologize.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: You apologize.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've modeled
this for my son.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Because believe me, again, with
all the training and experience

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I had, there were times
I lost it as well.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And to me, an apology
is not simply I'm sorry.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:90%
An apology has several parts.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The first is I'm sorry that I
lost it with you this morning.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The second is that you
empathize or you sort of visit

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.830 align:middle line:90%
their side of the fence.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And let them know that you can
imagine how that affected them.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine that it
was kind of scary for you

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:84%
when mommy really
was yelling while we

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:90%
were getting in the car.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That might have felt
yucky in your body.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about when
you were five years old

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and they might
not even remember?

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, the essence
of them remembers.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.529 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I'm really
sorry that I x, y, z.

00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you go back that far?

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You can
bring it up absolutely

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:90%
if you think that it's relevant.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The third piece
would be I'm working

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:90%
on not doing that again.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm working to be a
better person and more

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in charge of myself, and
even when I'm frustrated,

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:84%
learning different
ways of handling that.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you can forgive me.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything you
need from me sweetheart?

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So to me, there
are these elements

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of an apology that not only
help the child restore trust

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and faith in you, but
that model for her--

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:84%
like, I now see with
my 22-year-old son,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:84%
when he is rude or
edgy, he owns it.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Mom, you know what?

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.542 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, when I
was talking to you--

00:44:10.542 --> 00:44:10.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sorry.

00:44:10.659 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.449 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: --I'm
really sorry for that.

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:15.469 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a series of excuses
or rationalizations you know.

00:44:15.469 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
about when parents

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.420 align:middle line:84%
are going through very,
very tough economic times

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.379 align:middle line:84%
and they're fighting
about money and there's

00:44:21.379 --> 00:44:22.420 align:middle line:90%
fighting between parents?

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.336 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Tension.

00:44:23.336 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tension.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you turn around and
apologize to the child?

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do you
do, just let it ride?

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
start with, you know,

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you were around
this morning when

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.520 align:middle line:84%
daddy and I were
yelling at each other.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I call this a
Sunday afternoon Act I.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
the Act I. I would

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:84%
love to hear from
you, sweetheart,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.440 align:middle line:90%
how that was for you.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:84%
What was that like for you when
you heard daddy and me arguing?

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And then zip your lips together.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.574 align:middle line:84%
And keep letting the
child tell me more.

00:44:48.574 --> 00:44:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So she might say
I didn't like it.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.157 align:middle line:84%
And don't justify or explain,
or "we only did it because."

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or solve it.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.906 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You're not
going to the solving.

00:44:55.906 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:90%
You're just bringing it back.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine that was a
little bit rough on you.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty loud.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you like that when
mommy and daddy are so loud.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're just helping
her feel that you're

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:90%
captaining the ship again.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You've restored your role.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I can hear your truth.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get through this.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in a
calm moment, listen

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.319 align:middle line:84%
without solving,
fixing, explaining.

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And let it ride.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.688 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I
call it offloading.

00:45:21.688 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
piece that-- if we

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
can talk about frustration, if
it fits here-- when children

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.020 align:middle line:84%
are frustrated, it's
like they're on a road.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, it
could be frustrating

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that the child can't have
the household that she wants,

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:84%
or she can't get out
of doing homework.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.834 align:middle line:84%
So when a child's
frustrated, they're

00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:84%
either going to
become aggressive.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:46.397 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to homework if
that's OK, just for a second.

00:45:46.397 --> 00:45:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And she might become aggressive.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I hate you.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:84%
You're always making me do
things I don't want to do.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Or she adapts.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And to adapt, the
child needs to go

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.125 align:middle line:84%
through-- I use
Kubler-Ross' model-- denial.

00:45:56.125 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm really going to have
to do this homework.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Anger, why
are you making me do it?

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.923 align:middle line:90%
Bargaining, mommy, please.

00:46:01.923 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:84%
If you just give me 20
more minutes, I'll do it.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Disappointment,
instead of depression,

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.780 align:middle line:84%
where she feels sad
about having to do

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:90%
the homework, and acceptance.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Any time you've stumbled
and you've gotten upset

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.850 align:middle line:84%
because there's been a
problem, the child, in a sense,

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.730 align:middle line:84%
needs you to
restore and help her

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.150 align:middle line:90%
feel sad about what happened.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the
fighting in the morning,

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.385 align:middle line:84%
you just sometimes
might help her

00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:28.150 align:middle line:84%
have a cry about the fight this
morning that she overheard.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about when they
do something that is either

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.980 align:middle line:84%
harmful to someone or they
break something that's valuable

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.320 align:middle line:84%
or they do something quote
"wrong" in your world?

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.890 align:middle line:84%
How do you not chastise them in
the moment, make them feel bad?

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Or I mean, how do you teach?

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.558 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's
a good question.

00:46:47.558 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So when the child's
triggered and upset

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.720 align:middle line:84%
or you're triggered
and upset, those

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.880 align:middle line:90%
are not teachable moments.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Just forget it.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
where the crying over

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:84%
spilled milk phrase
comes from, right?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: So let's
say an example might

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:00.590 align:middle line:90%
be that she broke something.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.417 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.417 --> 00:47:05.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling pretty
calm and, you know,

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:84%
it's not your priceless
heirloom and you

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:84%
feel like you can handle
it, then you say wow.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And she may, depending
on what the precedent

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.070 align:middle line:84%
has been, if she feels you're
going to get really reactive,

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:84%
might make excuses, might
pretend she didn't do it,

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.302 align:middle line:84%
might blame it on
her brother, right?

00:47:21.302 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I didn't do that.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: But if
you see her, you know,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.510 align:middle line:84%
throwing the ball and
it hits the thing,

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and you had said don't
play with the ball inside,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you know
the vase is on the floor--

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the
water on the laptop.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.831 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes,
hypothetically speaking.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.985 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you,
sweetie, it's going

00:47:39.985 --> 00:47:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to take me a couple of
minutes to kind of get back

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.854 align:middle line:84%
to where I want to be to talk
about what just happened.

00:47:45.854 --> 00:47:47.020 align:middle line:90%
So you're modeling for her--

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you take a break?

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I
might take a break.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Especially, if there's water
in the laptop, and you've

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:84%
been discussing
that a few times.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.393 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the adult brain
goes to all the things

00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:90%
that you just lost.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Exactly.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you need to go
take a timeout yourself?

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: You may.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.450 align:middle line:90%
You may.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:58.991 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
then there may well

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.517 align:middle line:84%
be some reasonable, appropriate
response on her part,

00:48:04.517 --> 00:48:06.350 align:middle line:84%
of course, depending
on her age and the rest

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of the circumstances.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we do want our kids to
be responsible and accountable.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not raising children, by
the way, we're raising adults.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
always letting your kids

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.290 align:middle line:84%
off the hook-- so
it may well be you

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.370 align:middle line:84%
made a decision and a choice to
play with the ball inside when

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I asked you several
times not to.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.750 align:middle line:84%
In a little while, we're going
to talk about what's next.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:90%
But not in a mean, scary way.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm owning the role here.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk a little
bit about-- these

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:84%
are good topics--
sex, drugs, and food.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
not rock and roll?

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.305 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not all at once.

00:48:38.305 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:90%
No, sex, drugs, and food.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So sex we've covered a little
bit on how to talk about,

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:90%
educate.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever use yourself as
an example and say, oh, well,

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I had sex when I was nine.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So I don't suggest
you doing that.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you ever
suggest doing that?

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.775 align:middle line:84%
They're going to only
model your behavior, right?

00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Back when I did all
those drugs, don't do them.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:58.833 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: No, I don't.

00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And you know, our
kids are so hip.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.180 align:middle line:90%
They're so tuned into us.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty sure that we did
something, that we did inhale.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it depends
on the age of the child.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that you
can go back and say,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.236 align:middle line:84%
here's some of the choices that
I made that I regret making.

00:49:17.236 --> 00:49:17.991 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:49:17.991 --> 00:49:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I
absolutely might say that.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wouldn't say
that to a 12-year-old.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I might say that to a
15-year-old who is about to go

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.512 align:middle line:84%
to a party where
there's likely to be--

00:49:26.512 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know
drugs are present.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.553 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Now,
with a 15-year-old,

00:49:29.553 --> 00:49:33.620 align:middle line:84%
it well may be that my
15-year-old doesn't go, too.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a funny age.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And there's a funny line there.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that your bigger goal

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.017 align:middle line:84%
is to hold yourself
in a place where

00:49:42.017 --> 00:49:43.600 align:middle line:84%
your kids feel like
they can tell you.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.975 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, they're not
going to tell you everything.

00:49:45.975 --> 00:49:46.730 align:middle line:90%
They're just not.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.570 align:middle line:84%
There's going to always
be this edginess.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.361 align:middle line:84%
Because their job is to
individuate as they get older.

00:49:51.361 --> 00:49:51.902 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:51.902 --> 00:49:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned my
15-year-old might not go.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.880 align:middle line:84%
At what point do you let
them go and work out that no

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.890 align:middle line:84%
or let them go and
make their own choices,

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in your world.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: There's
no hard and fast--

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.254 align:middle line:84%
it depends so much on the
child and their judgment

00:50:04.254 --> 00:50:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and who they're hanging out
with, the rest of the friends.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.920 align:middle line:84%
With my son, I trusted
him quite a bit.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I trusted the crowd
he hung around with.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.540 align:middle line:90%
They were pretty good kids.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I knew they were
probably doing something.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're also
childhood friends.

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: They're
childhood friends.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a safe place
where we lived.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.960 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
elements to consider.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Is there a car involved?

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Are parents home?

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Adults present.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
then, of course, it's

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.781 align:middle line:84%
sort of shocking,
because the parents

00:50:27.781 --> 00:50:29.990 align:middle line:84%
might be buying
them the alcohol.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So food, other
question, about at what

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.310 align:middle line:84%
point do you monitor, tell them
what to eat, what not to eat?

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.602 align:middle line:84%
How do you avoid eating
disorders, body images?

00:50:39.602 --> 00:50:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh, gosh.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do we have another hour?

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: In 30 seconds?

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know, exactly.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:51.041 align:middle line:84%
So at what point do you set up
what a child's intake of food

00:50:51.041 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:90%
should be?

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
monitor that or not?

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: You
know, most of us

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.410 align:middle line:84%
want our kids to eat healthy
food as long as we can possibly

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.190 align:middle line:90%
convince them to do that.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And there will come a
point, for most children,

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.480 align:middle line:84%
where they will do what
you don't want them to.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They will eat the
Twinkies and the Fritos.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.529 align:middle line:84%
And they'll take great
pleasure in doing it

00:51:12.529 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:84%
when they know that
you don't want them to.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: First thing I
did when I got a car,

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.814 align:middle line:90%
went and got Doritos.

00:51:16.814 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Exactly, right?

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.082 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yup, exactly.

00:51:21.082 --> 00:51:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I use
these two words a lot

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.100 align:middle line:84%
as kids get older,
amused and indifferent.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So that there's a
part of you that's

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
watching this thing, the
same thing you probably did.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.350 align:middle line:90%
You just can't care that much.

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't make it mean
these big global things when

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.790 align:middle line:84%
your kids deviate
from the organic vegan

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.250 align:middle line:84%
sort of thing for
a little while.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:41.277 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's my opinion.

00:51:41.277 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean I'm right.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.401 align:middle line:84%
And there are some kids
who will really staunchly

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:46.450 align:middle line:90%
adhere to the plan.

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.270 align:middle line:90%
You can certainly use fear.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And you could say here are the
implications of eating food

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:90%
with additives.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, I think
most of our kids

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.300 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to
sort of find their way.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.342 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But when you see
a child gaining weight--

00:51:58.342 --> 00:52:00.008 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Oh,
well that's different.

00:52:00.008 --> 00:52:02.729 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --getting, you know,
out of the healthy weight range?

00:52:02.729 --> 00:52:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And some of that is going to
be what you have in the house.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of it--
usually kids who

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.270 align:middle line:84%
are overeating who
are mindlessly eating,

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.930 align:middle line:84%
who are snacking,
who are ingesting

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:84%
just massive quantities without
knowing if they're hungry,

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.290 align:middle line:84%
there's a different
issue there anyway.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm always, always looking
underneath to the root

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
cause of a child's
problematic behavior.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't treat it with scripts.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:24.563 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do it superficially.

00:52:24.563 --> 00:52:28.090 align:middle line:84%
There's always a way that the
child's behavior makes sense.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I line up with that.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So the question
would be, why does it

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.920 align:middle line:84%
make sense that my child
is eating constantly,

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.120 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to how can
I get him to stop?

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Why does it make sense
that my daughter wants

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to have sex with her
12-year-old boyfriend,

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.710 align:middle line:84%
rather than how
can I control it?

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it what's
missing that they

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.790 align:middle line:90%
would need to cover with that?

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:45.956 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Very possibly.

00:52:45.956 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:90%
It might be what's missing.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It might be a peer influence.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It might be all kinds of things.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
biochemical.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be hormonal.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
grandma just died.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:58.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.471 align:middle line:84%
But I want to find out
what the actual reason is,

00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:03.610 align:middle line:84%
so I can captain the ship
and sail through the storm,

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.900 align:middle line:90%
not to be too nautical on you.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.300 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to, how do I just
control my child's behavior?

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're looking
for the need or a way

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.731 align:middle line:84%
to find out what's going

00:53:15.731 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:90%

>>STIFFELMAN: Great.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.708 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I'm looking
at the recap here.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.889 align:middle line:84%
And just because this

00:53:21.889 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:84%
it's the first time
they've heard it,

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing here

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:28.834 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned is that we,
as parents, are not always

00:53:28.834 --> 00:53:29.750 align:middle line:90%
going to get it right.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: That's right.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There isn't
a right and a wrong.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Thank you.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
a way of doing it

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that it can be as
conscious as possible

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and be mindful as possible.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And someone once told me
when I had a young child

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that your relationship
to your coffee cup

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.960 align:middle line:90%
will be observed by your child.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from that
was every single thing you do

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is mirrored when they
are little, little.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And they look at your
relationship to everything.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's just something
as simple as a coffee cup.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.602 align:middle line:84%
They will look at how you
sip it and the relationships

00:54:01.602 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in the bigger
picture that you have

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.474 align:middle line:84%
with your spouses
and your parents.

00:54:06.474 --> 00:54:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The way you treat
your mother will

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.785 align:middle line:84%
be the way they
treat their mother.

00:54:09.785 --> 00:54:10.701 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Exactly.

00:54:10.701 --> 00:54:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's
something to be aware of.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You're not always
going to perfect it.

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Right.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:16.086 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't.

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of it though.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Well, that's
the start, you know?

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm aware of my not
perfecting it sometimes.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.498 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: Like
when I do talks,

00:54:21.498 --> 00:54:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll often say if you get
nothing else today, think about

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.072 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
here, here, or here.

00:54:26.072 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And just pay attention.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Be aware.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Change always starts
with awareness.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.216 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
I have a chapter

00:54:31.216 --> 00:54:33.860 align:middle line:84%
called, Live Like Your Kids
Are Watching, Because They Are.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's exactly
what you're saying.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.831 align:middle line:84%
Our greatest influence over our
children is not what we say,

00:54:38.831 --> 00:54:40.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's how we live our
lives in front of them.

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:41.850 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's true for when
you have other people's

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.071 align:middle line:90%
children in your house as well.

00:54:46.071 --> 00:54:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not like nobody's watching.

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So a few of the
things we've learned

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:55.910 align:middle line:84%
is the captain of the ship
doesn't need their child

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to behave to know
that she's in charge.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very important part.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:06.580 align:middle line:84%
To come alongside your child,
rather than at your child.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Connection, being very,
very, very important,

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.944 align:middle line:90%
and it's never too late.

00:55:10.944 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: It's
never, ever too late.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's so touching
for me in the work

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I do, I might have an
18-year-old or a 20-year-old.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The parent finally
convinces the kid

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:22.032 align:middle line:84%
to come in and do some
counseling, but warns me,

00:55:22.032 --> 00:55:23.240 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to say a word.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.614 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to
open his mouth.

00:55:24.614 --> 00:55:25.340 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't talk.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can't get the kid to
shut up, to be quiet, to not...

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.500 align:middle line:90%
to stop talking.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I find out
how much he longs

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to talk like
that with his parents.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:90%
It's so sweet.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is also
really great information

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:39.320 align:middle line:90%
for grandparents--

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --who have
a very big divide

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of generational
divide and knowing

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.650 align:middle line:84%
how to respond to teenage
grandchildren, who now have

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.920 align:middle line:84%
technology that
grandparents never had.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.345 align:middle line:90%
And babies, too.

00:55:55.345 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: And
also, the grandparent

00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is in this terrific
position to be

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.900 align:middle line:84%
an influencer of the child
at a phase of his or her life

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.220 align:middle line:84%
when he can't really go to
mom and dad as comfortably,

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but might be able to
go to a grandparent

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:84%
if the grandparent really
has the feeling of safety.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Safe.

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a very important role.

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:15.830 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to cover.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STIFFELMAN: My pleasure.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:18.954 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -we did a good job
in the small amount of time

00:56:18.954 --> 00:56:19.570 align:middle line:90%

connect with you.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.965 align:middle line:84%

questions on Facebook.

00:56:22.965 --> 00:56:24.464 align:middle line:84%
>>STIFFELMAN: I'm
there on Facebook.

00:56:24.464 --> 00:56:26.451 align:middle line:84%
I have a page there where
I engage with people.

00:56:26.451 --> 00:56:28.075 align:middle line:84%
And I have my newsletter
on my website,

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:90%

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:31.900 align:middle line:90%
So I'm easy to find.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if people have
individual questions,

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.790 align:middle line:84%
they can reach you
