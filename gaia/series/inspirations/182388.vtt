>>LISA GARR: You've
heard the phrase,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:90%
"To be human is to suffer."

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the Dalai Lama has a
mission to end suffering.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So is suffering really
necessary for the soul

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%
to grow and to find meaning?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
and joining me

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
is a senior rabbi at Wilshire
Boulevard Temple, Rabbi Steve

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Leder, who was twice named by
Newsweek as one of the 10 most

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:90%
influential rabbis in America.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
In his book "More
Beautiful Than Before,"

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:10%
Rabbi Leder talks about his own
journey with pain and suffering

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and how it made him
more available than ever

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:10%
before to listen to
people's stories about pain.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVE LEDER: Thank you.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.547 align:middle line:10%
I'm very honored to be here.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: No, it's my pleasure.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:10%
You do hear a lot of people's
stories about pain, don't you?

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: I do.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Listen, I'm the
senior rabbi of one

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:10%
of the largest
synagogues in the world.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm--

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.875 align:middle line:10%
>>LEDER: --ultimately
responsible

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:10%
for about 10,000
people's religious lives.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
it's my phone that

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
rings when people's
lives fall apart,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
when their bodies fall
apart, when they're facing

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:90%
the scalpel or the cemetery.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And this happens many hundreds
of times over my more than 30

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
years there.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:10%
So I've been on the inside
of an awful lot of suffering.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The way a friend of mine
puts it is he said, Steve,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
your job is a
front-row seat to life.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Does it ever wear on you?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Oh, it does.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, cliches become
cliches because they're

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally true.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've all heard of this
notion of the wounded healer.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would be
possible to serve and to be

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
in giving mode and
in caretaking mode

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
for that many years
and that many hours

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and that many days
and weeks and months

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
for decades without
being depleted by it.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
The hope is that you can be
secure in your own spirituality

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and your own sense of
meaning and that it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
worth the sacrifice to
you, without denying

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it is a
tremendous sacrifice.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.977 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: But
hopefully, one you're

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
proud of having
made with your life.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's not an
easy road to travel.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've seen
generation upon generation

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
come through your
congregation, haven't you?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yes.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I've been there long enough
now to be doing Bar and Bat

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Mitzvahs for the
children of couples

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I married, to be
burying grandparents

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and parents of a child,
to be doing weddings

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the children of
people I married,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:90%
which is quite extraordinary.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.125 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You wonder
where the time goes.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:07.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yes.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:08.767 align:middle line:90%
Yes, for all of us.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I think my mother had
this expression, which

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is so true, which I didn't
understand when I was young.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
She would say, the days are
long, but the years are short.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very true.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you had your own
experience with pain recently.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.185 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Well, I did.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So we were just talking about
the extraordinary amount

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
of pain that I've
witnessed and tried

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to help people walk through.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I had my own
experience with severe pain.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
About five years ago now, I
had a very frightening car

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
accident-- a hit
and run, by the way.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a large SUV and
turned our car around.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:90%
The airbags went off.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that,
physically, I had walked away

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
from it relatively unscathed--

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
a little scraped up,
but nothing more.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:10%
And then, a few
months later, I had

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:10%
this extraordinarily painful,
torturous lower back pain

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:10%
that shot down to my left toes
and essentially, honestly,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.643 align:middle line:10%
left me paralyzed.

00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time in my life--

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.393 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, Lisa, if you've
ever had this experience--

00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:18.265 align:middle line:84%
where my brain told my body
to move, and it wouldn't.

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's frightening.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.557 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Imagine your brain
saying to you, you know,

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
scratch this itch, and
your arm just doesn't move.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, my brain said, walk,
and I just couldn't move.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
It was just too painful.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And this led to opioids,
steroids, surgery,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
more opioids, more steroids,
opioid addiction, depression,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
a downward spiral
that was pretty awful.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And I came out of it.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I came out of it for a
lot of different reasons.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And those reasons
formed the foundation

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of this book, "More
Beautiful Than Before--

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:90%
How Suffering Transforms Us."

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, the
book is, in a way,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
my apology to my congregation.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Because for 27 years
before this accident,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
people about pain

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and trying to help them
through their pain.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, after this
accident and this surgery

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and this depression,
that despite my best

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
efforts in the past, I actually
knew almost nothing about pain.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to set
the record straight.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So while the book is only maybe
5% about me and my situation,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
it is 100% about
how can each of us

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
journey through pain, which
is inevitable for all of us.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:84%
How can we journey
through it in a way that

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
makes our lives more worthy?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, Dostoyevsky
said his greatest fear

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
was that his life would not
be worthy of his suffering.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:90%
That's such a powerful idea.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%

what will we,

the luckiest Jews

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:90%
do with our good fortune?

Will we squander it?

Will we disappear?

Or will we honor the sacrifices

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.585 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
point of the book,

00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:35.893 align:middle line:84%
is can you be worthy of this and
can you make something of it?

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear
about something--

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
neither what I stand for nor
what the book articulates is,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in any way, an
idealization of suffering,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
a glorification of suffering.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is terrible.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is suffering.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Pain is pain.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing good
to say about it.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
However, while none of the
insights or growth that

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
result from pain are
worth it, I would never

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
say to the parents
of a child who died,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
worth it for the way

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.337 align:middle line:84%
that it informs your
life going forward.

00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not worth it.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:90%
But neither is it worthless.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you think about
the scroll Book of Ecclesiastes,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
it says there's a
season for everything.

There's a time for everything.

00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on to say
there's a time for everything

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and a purpose.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't say there's a reason.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It says there's a purpose.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
There is some
purpose to be found.

And I can only tell you that,
personally, what I went through

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:10%

words upon our hearts.

is that these parents survive
the death of their children,

00:22:49.027 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%

"When Bad Things Happen

Harold Kushner's book.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The title of that famous book

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wishes
someone could write

they both affect the

The one difference is-- and
this is why, on some level,

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
physical pain can be
easier in the long run--

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't re-summon
the pain of physical pain.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.622 align:middle line:84%
You can't re-feel it,

the pain of public shame,
whatever it is, you

blue-collar family.

My dad owned a junkyard.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.922 align:middle line:84%
Not a metal recycling
plant, a junkyard.

00:24:54.922 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I was one of five kids.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
There were seven of us in a
three bedroom, one bathroom

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:90%
house.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, I grew up
in a very modest way.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
family that was not

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
particularly religious,
although culturally very Jewish.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I knew almost as much Yiddish in
kindergarten as I did English.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't a particularly
religious family.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And because of this
kind of very demanding,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
hard-driving father that I had--

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and because of his
background, having grown up

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
on public assistance as a
child through the Depression--

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
almost any creative pursuit was
dismissed as a waste of time

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.877 align:middle line:90%
when I was a child.

00:25:31.877 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:90%

The one creative pursuit,
the one creative endeavor

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.657 align:middle line:84%
gravitated toward that one
place that was about the spirit.

00:26:06.657 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And freedom.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: It was freedom.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It was spirit.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:90%
It was music.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It was art.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.075 align:middle line:90%
It was stories, so many stories.

00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is the
Bible if not a collection

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
of stories about
the human condition?

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
synagogue was an oasis

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in this blue-collared desert of
dirt and grease and hard work.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that that's
a big part of it.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
I thought very serious

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.005 align:middle line:90%
about going into politics.

00:26:33.005 --> 00:26:34.655 align:middle line:84%
I was an undergraduate
at Northwestern.

00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I was in the writing
program at Northwestern.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But I took a summer
and part of a semester

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
off and volunteered on
a congressional campaign

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.423 align:middle line:90%
in Southern Illinois in 1980.

00:26:44.423 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with a bunch of
the guys who ended up running

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:90%
the Clinton White House.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was the other
thing I was interested in,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is I think I want to be a
senator and change the world.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
When I got on the
inside of politics

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and saw what it was really about
and who it was really about,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:90%
I wanted nothing to do with it.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a very negative
experience for me,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was just about
money and being predatory.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And I had no interest in that.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So that that campaign
really did me a favor

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and just reaffirmed
my commitment

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.222 align:middle line:90%
to pursue a life of the spirit.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
We have two early
childhood centers,

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
two elementary schools, two
sleepaway camps in Malibu.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing collection
of people and places,

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm incredibly,
incredibly proud of.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's also very
contemporary at the same time

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it's holding on
to the tradition,

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.373 align:middle line:84%
which there's something
to be said for that.

00:27:48.373 --> 00:27:49.957 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Well, I
think it's essential.

00:27:49.957 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to be
rooted in the past,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but we also have to be leaning
forward into the future

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or we'll lose the
next generation.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And I wouldn't blame them a bit.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So I try very hard to be
both timely and timeless

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:90%
in my messages.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Also, I work hard at hiring
a lot of young people, which

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:90%
I think is very important well.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how do you
keep to that tradition

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and honor the suffering of the
Jewish people at the same time

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:84%
as be contemporary and move
the conversation forward?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Well, you
know, Jewish history

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:90%
is not only about suffering.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: It's also about
poetry and music and stories

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:90%
of deep faith and transcendence.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only about
suffering, you know.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
do allow that kind

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.823 align:middle line:84%
of suffering to eclipse
the joy of Judaism,

00:28:37.823 --> 00:28:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
a huge mistake.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: You know, I gave
a sermon many years ago

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:90%
that was pretty controversial.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And in it, I talked not about
forgetting the Holocaust,

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but about transcending
the Holocaust.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That the last thing those
victims would have wanted

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
was for us to perpetuate or
embrace a joyless Judaism.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: And so this is about
transcending oppression,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
not forgetting it.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But also not being
identified by it.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Because darkness really
doesn't hold people.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's true that
those who forget history

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
are doomed to repeat it.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But it is also true that those
who only remember history

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
are also doomed to repeat it.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Right?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: And so it is,
as you articulated,

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
this dichotomous tension between
past, present, and future,

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:90%
and they're all important.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think we, at least, have
struck a pretty decent balance,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.482 align:middle line:90%
and it seems to be working.

00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the controversy
that you received

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
was the remembrance and the--

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: How dare you forget.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't talk
about forgetting,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
but I talked about
transcending it.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is
for this generation

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of American kids in general,
darkness doesn't hold them.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.440 align:middle line:90%
They want light.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.938 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: They want joy.

00:29:54.938 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: We all do, and to
define oneself by the darkness

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.665 align:middle line:90%
is a mistake.

00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to honor it.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.082 align:middle line:84%
And this gets back
to this whole idea

00:30:04.082 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
of honoring your pain
without being defined by it.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am so glad
that you said that.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
That is the basis
of what I believe

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and what I have created
this show based on.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Well, I'm glad.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: We're kindred spirits.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We are.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see
your rabbi leader

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:90%
in action giving a sermon.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: So what have I
learned from 30 years of death

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that I can share with
you on this evening, when

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we are commanded to consider
our own deaths in order that we

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:90%
might change our lives?

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.930 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I have
learned about death

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
might surprise you,
which is there are

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:90%
many things worse than dying.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I've held the hands of
hundreds of dying people.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It might amaze you to know
that not once, not one time,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.515 align:middle line:90%
has any of them been afraid.

00:31:07.515 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.210 align:middle line:84%
There are rare exceptions,
but most people

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.380 align:middle line:84%
die at the end of a very
long life or, if young,

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
after a long,
debilitating illness.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Age and disease have their
own rhythm and power.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:90%
They teach us.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They carry us along,
preparing us and the people

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
we love for death.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:38.465 align:middle line:84%
For most, death comes as
a sort of peaceful friend.

00:31:38.465 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Most people are ready
to die the way we're all

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.410 align:middle line:84%
ready to sleep after a very long
and terribly exhausting day.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We just want to pull
the covers up around us

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and settle in for
the peace of it all.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
We are not anxious
about sleeping.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:90%
We are not depressed.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We are not afraid.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:84%
The rabbis called death
[SPEAKING HEBREW]----

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.925 align:middle line:90%
perfect sleep.

00:32:10.925 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Disease and age and life
itself prepare us for death,

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and when it is really
our time, death

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:90%
is as natural a thing as life.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Here's some good news--

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
this means that if you
are afraid of dying,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
it's not your day.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was this sermon
on Rosh Hashanah?

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: That
sermon was actually

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:84%
given on the eve of
Yom Kippur, called

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Kol Nidre, the holiest
night of the year for Jews.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's an evening
that really does--

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:84%
if you see the
whole sermon, it's

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
an evening that's meant to force
us to contemplate our deaths so

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that we might take our
lives more seriously.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yeah.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
imagery and metaphors

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:10%
in the liturgy and
the choreography

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:10%
of the service that force us
to think about our own deaths.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:10%
We fast because
the dead don't eat.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't drink.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
We wear white because the
traditional Jew is buried

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in a white burial shroud.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:84%
We begin with an empty what we
call arc on the pulpit, which

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:90%
holds the Torahs.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the Hebrew word for arc
and the Hebrew word for coffin

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:90%
are the same word.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So we begin the evening
staring into an empty coffin.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there are all these
ways in which that evening

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is structured to force
us to contemplate

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
our deaths, simply and
purely, so that we might

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:90%
think about changing our lives.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's Yom Kippur.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.162 align:middle line:84%
And then after that
is Rosh Hashanah?

00:33:52.162 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Rosh
Hashanah precedes it.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Precedes?

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:90%
It can you explain--

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Which I'll tell you
something also very interesting

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.238 align:middle line:84%
based on what we were
just talking about,

00:33:58.238 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:84%
about privilege and
light over darkness.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So Rosh Hashanah is the holiday
that affirms the new year,

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
celebrates the new year,
embraces the new year.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And Yom Kippur is the
holiday on our festival

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
on which we atone for our
sins and regrets and mistakes

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:90%
from the past year.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's structured
counterintuitively, right?

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
You would think,
first, you would

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:84%
think about the sins of
the past, clean the slate,

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and then go forward to
embrace the new year.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But the rabbis constructed
it in just the opposite way.

Why?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It is a demonstration of

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and our faith in God
and goodness and light.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.740 align:middle line:90%
First we celebrate, then--

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Life.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
beautiful thing, when

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:84%
you think about it, that we
privilege light over darkness.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't deny the darkness,
but light comes first.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:84%
And this is built into
Judaism in many ways.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Talmud says a
wedding processional interrupts

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:90%
a funeral procession.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:90%

You know, your thumb

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:90%

And I think they fear death--

00:35:41.548 --> 00:35:43.090 align:middle line:84%
their fear of death
is really, if you

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
think about it, a reflection of
how much they love life, right?

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:90%

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: So first of all, I
don't think it predominates.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the symptom
of a love of life

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:90%
more than a symptom of fear.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But people who fear death
haven't seen much of it

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%

have, or maybe you have.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%

Now, how do I deal
with that with people

00:36:44.437 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:90%

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:90%

If you are worried about

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Anxiety is for the living.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

People who are really
dying, they're not afraid,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and they're not anxious.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think if people

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.700 align:middle line:84%
they would calm

its own rhythm and power,
its own trajectory.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And it prepares you.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It prepares you to let go, and
it prepares your loved ones

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.600 align:middle line:90%
to let go.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
My father-- I haven't talked
about this on camera yet.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:84%
My father died two weeks
ago after 10 years with

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And when this all began 10
years ago with that diagnosis,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
if you had asked
me, will you ever be

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:84%
grateful for the day your father
dies, I would have said no.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But my father died two weeks
ago peacefully in his sleep,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:90%
and I was deeply grateful.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because death came to my
father as a peaceful friend.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:10%
There are many things
worse than dying--

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:10%
many.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And being that ill
is one of them.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a hard
thing to understand

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
until you've lived it yourself
or through a loved one,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:84%
but death is not
something I fear.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:90%

of eulogizing my
father and placing

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
those shovelfuls of earth
on his plain pine casket

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
also came with their
own dose of anesthesia.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We somehow protect
ourselves as we

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
go through these intense
emotional experiences,

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:90%
and I was grateful for that.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I was as present as
I was able to be.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
more present, frankly.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think there's any--

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I know there's no
way through life

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
without walking through
these difficult experiences.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And my point in this
book is that you do not

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:84%
have to come out of
them a lesser person.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You come out of them a greater,
more spiritual, more beautiful

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.710 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why I called it "More
Beautiful Than Before."

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And suffering is the
transformational component.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.373 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way.

00:41:44.373 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the
Jewish tradition

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.760 align:middle line:84%
has a wonderful way of honoring
the transition of a loved one.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yes, very true.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's in Shiva.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yes.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So Judaism-- the
rabbis were very wise.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes laws are
created to limit and control

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
human behavior.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're
created in response

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:84%
to what human behavior
requires, what we need.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The laws of mourning
in Judaism--

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
so clearly, from
my perspective--

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
were designed to support
people and scaffold them

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:84%
during this time of intense
emotional, and sometimes

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:90%
physical, need.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So the first three days
are called, in Hebrew,

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.490 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]----
days of weeping.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:90%
All you do is weep.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.290 align:middle line:84%
You have no responsibilities
and no obligations

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.150 align:middle line:84%
other than to curl
up in a ball and cry

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.730 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you want to do.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The first seven days
after the burial

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
are called Shiva, which is
the Hebrew word for seven.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And during that
period, you stay home.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:90%
You hunker down.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.055 align:middle line:84%
The community is
supposed to provide food.

00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a prayer service in the
morning and one in the evening

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
when you're surrounded by
friends and family who remember

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and who care.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And you just allow the
community to hold you.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
something quite beautiful

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that I do talk
about in the book.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago,
I was at a Shiva,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:84%
leading the service for a man
whose 30-year-old daughter was

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:90%
killed in a car accident.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
There we were that evening in
the service, and at the end,

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
we all had our arms around each
other, and we were singing.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And he looked around this
circle, and he turned to me

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and he said, this
changes nothing,

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.817 align:middle line:90%
but it means everything.

00:43:25.817 --> 00:43:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never heard it
put more beautifully.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: So this seven
days changes nothing,

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.392 align:middle line:90%
and it means everything.

00:43:34.392 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there
are all these rules

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:90%
about how to behave.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.612 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
approach the mourner

00:43:38.612 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:90%
unless they summon you.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:84%
If they do, you're not
allowed to distract them

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.452 align:middle line:90%
from talking about their grief.

00:43:43.452 --> 00:43:45.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's our
natural inclination.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:90%
How about those Dodgers, right?

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.810 align:middle line:90%

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: That's wrong.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.057 align:middle line:90%
They want to talk about it.

00:43:49.057 --> 00:43:50.140 align:middle line:90%
They want to hear stories.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:90%
They want to cry.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.150 align:middle line:84%
They need to, and you have
to be sensitive to that

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and dial into that
frequency that they're on.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the first 30 days
is a whole other period

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of refrain from doing all kinds
of things, normal activities.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the first year,
you don't go to parties.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be around
music and dancing now people.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, people misunderstand
this prohibition.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, it's seen as
disrespectful to the deceased

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
if you're partying.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.880 align:middle line:84%
It's because during that first
year of grief, for many people,

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.805 align:middle line:84%
it's so difficult to
be around happy people.

00:44:24.805 --> 00:44:26.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
be around them.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%

permission-- to take your time.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:84%

sometimes three or four months

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.100 align:middle line:84%
after a death and say, Rabbi,
my kids are worried about me.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to date.

And I said, no, there's
something wrong with your kids.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Three or four months is nothing.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You spent 60 years

extremely important in this

It's the root of suffering.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was equating
when one is patient,

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.660 align:middle line:84%
you're just prolonging or being
tolerant of the suffering.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.930 align:middle line:84%

noun and an adjective,

00:46:29.738 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:84%
but nouns and adjectives
are not the same thing.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.480 align:middle line:84%
To be a patient is
to definitionally

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:90%
be in some form of suffering.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.690 align:middle line:84%
To be patient can be a
form of suffering, right?

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:84%
A way to think of it
is, how does one endure

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.040 align:middle line:90%
that period of suffering?

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you endure it with some
degree of equanimity, of grace,

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:90%
of quiet strength?

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's a form of
patience, of tolerance.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, the word for
tolerance and patience--

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I-E-N-C-E, patience
and tolerance--

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:90%
come from the same root.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So to be patient is
also to be tolerant,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to tolerate something, to
withstand it, to take it.

Well, first of all, what
you say and don't say

And my answer is always,
it doesn't matter.

That's the first thing.

00:51:47.228 --> 00:51:50.800 align:middle line:84%

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's fake.

about how to deal

00:55:04.593 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
with certain types of pain--
grief, divorce, chronic pain,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.560 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.970 align:middle line:84%
There's almost
nothing about what

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:12.520 align:middle line:84%
do you do when you're
the betrayer, not

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:84%
the betrayed, when you're the
perpetrator, not the victim.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Because believe me, that's its
own world of very deep pain.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.460 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.458 align:middle line:90%
The first thing is--

00:55:27.458 --> 00:55:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this in a
chapter in the book called

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:35.500 align:middle line:84%
"Hurt and Run," where I had this
very crazy experience of two

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.990 align:middle line:84%
families in the
congregation in one year

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.330 align:middle line:84%
both losing loved
ones who were killed

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:90%
as pedestrians by drivers.

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:45.810 align:middle line:84%
In one case, it
was a hit and run.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.130 align:middle line:84%
In the other case,
the driver did

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:84%
everything possible
to set things right,

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.600 align:middle line:84%
understanding that you
can't bring someone back.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:90%
But she did her very best.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So I compare and contrast
these two situations.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And the incredible
unending, unbearable pain

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of hit and run
versus the healing

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that was possible for
accepting responsibility.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So, first thing, and
most important thing,

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to utter the
three most difficult words

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.550 align:middle line:84%
for any human being to say,
and they are not, I am sorry.

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because anybody who's
married knows "I'm sorry"

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.450 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of latitude, right?

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry you feel that I this.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry you think I that.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry you thought
I meant whatever.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry doesn't cut it.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Much more profound are the
three words I was wrong.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah,
that's powerful.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: I was wrong.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.850 align:middle line:84%
That is a much higher
degree of culpability.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It takes the sting
out right away.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no excuse.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.590 align:middle line:90%
There's no explanation.

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I accept that I was wrong.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.960 align:middle line:90%
That starts the conversation.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the book, I talk
about a four-step process

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.730 align:middle line:84%
that people can go through
to heal a relationship when

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.610 align:middle line:84%
they have caused the
pain or caused the break.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: First step-- stop.

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you were doing
that caused the problem--

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you're
still doing it, yeah.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: --stop.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.580 align:middle line:84%
If you were texting and
driving and hit this poor guy

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:27.080 align:middle line:84%
in the crosswalk
and killed him, you

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.080 align:middle line:84%
lock that phone in
the glove compartment.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Stop whatever it is.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Drinking, opioid,
whatever it is, stop.

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Gossip, stop.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Number two, confess
the sin out loud.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Say it out loud.

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.305 align:middle line:84%
Saying to oneself,
oh, I feel awful.

00:57:45.305 --> 00:57:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have done that.

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.260 align:middle line:90%
That was a mistake.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:54.190 align:middle line:84%
That's very different than
saying, Lisa, I was wrong.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have done that.

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm an alcoholic.

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.653 align:middle line:90%
Saying it out loud--

00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:02.903 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is the accountability.

00:58:02.903 --> 00:58:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: --is to own it.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Say it out loud.

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:12.087 align:middle line:84%
Number three, ask
for forgiveness.

00:58:12.087 --> 00:58:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's
what I was going to say.

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: I was wrong.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I have this problem.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Please forgive me.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And finally, create
a system, scaffolding

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in your life, that
will prevent you

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:33.250 align:middle line:84%
from doing whatever it was
again if given the opportunity.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:35.685 align:middle line:84%
If you're an alcoholic,
never go into a bar.

00:58:35.685 --> 00:58:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have an
accountability partner.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: If you're a sex
addict, no internet service

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:41.770 align:middle line:84%
at your house, and
your cell phone

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:43.540 align:middle line:84%
is only for phone
calls, whatever it is.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Create the scaffolding
you need to make sure

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.380 align:middle line:90%
that this won't happen again.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go through
all four of those steps

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and you seek forgiveness
and the person

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:90%
is unwilling to forgive--

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.320 align:middle line:84%
now, this comes
from the Talmud--

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.720 align:middle line:84%
three times, the sin
is then on that person.

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.420 align:middle line:84%

heinous the crime?

No?

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Well, there
are certain crimes,

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:12.640 align:middle line:84%
like murder, which
are unforgivable,

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.340 align:middle line:84%
because the person
can't forgive you.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would say if
the repentance is

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:23.620 align:middle line:84%
sincere and lasting and
forgiveness is not forthcoming,

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.740 align:middle line:84%
then you're choosing to
remain an unforgiving person.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is a choice.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.283 align:middle line:90%
Which is a choice, yes.

00:59:29.283 --> 00:59:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: And by
the way, forgiving

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean forgetting.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.638 align:middle line:90%
They're not the same thing.

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:36.430 align:middle line:84%

forget what happened.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:38.020 align:middle line:84%

>>LEDER: But I would
say that the book has

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.230 align:middle line:90%
proven very helpful.

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Many people have written
to me who have committed

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:49.730 align:middle line:90%
financial crimes, for example--

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gambling.

love and care about.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Saying, I was wrong--

>>LISA: Yeah, it's
very powerful.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.718 align:middle line:84%
Asking for forgiveness,
stopping the repeated pattern,

01:00:11.718 --> 01:00:13.510 align:middle line:84%
those are things that
I would want to hear.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But you hear
stories all the time

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.430 align:middle line:84%
of a person whose
child was killed

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and they forgave the person
who was the shooter because

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation that
it inspired and helped

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.010 align:middle line:90%
so many people around.

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: You know, I have to

I have a problem with that.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't judge why one person
chooses to forgive and why one

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But I would say without a person
having gone through these four

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
steps, I don't think
they merit forgiveness.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%

01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not hearing the

a stronger person,
a better person.

If forgiveness is
cheap, the perpetrator

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
or that it needs to still
hold on to tradition,

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
but it needs to move
forward in the world?

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts?

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.032 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: It's a delicate dance.

01:01:53.032 --> 01:01:54.510 align:middle line:90%
The answer is both.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.120 align:middle line:90%
The answer is both.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Religion at its best
is rooted in the past

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.290 align:middle line:90%
but oriented to the future.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:02.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's always
been the case.

01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Well,
sometimes religion

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is overly rooted in the
past and doesn't really

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:11.510 align:middle line:90%
talk much about the future.

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And the past is the past.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, someone once said, the
single thing most responsible

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.238 align:middle line:84%
for the good old
days is a bad memory.

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They weren't really so
good if you actually

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.400 align:middle line:90%
lived through them.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think the thing, for
me, certainly about Judaism--

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and from which, of course,
Christianity and Islam flow.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So I see Judaism as
kind of the mother

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
religion of all monotheistic
religions, which it is.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Judaism uses the stories of
our past, but only in as much

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
as they are
beneficial in creating

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
a different and better future.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
All of Judaism is oriented
toward a time in the future we

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
call the Olam Ha-Ba,
the world to come--

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
a kind of everlasting utopian
existence in the world.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
So Judaism--

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.247 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That would
be good for everyone.

01:03:00.247 --> 01:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LEDER: Yes, and Judaism is
definitional forward-facing.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But of course, using
these foundation

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
stories from the past
to inform our decisions

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.160 align:middle line:90%
about the future going forward.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
have a beautiful concept

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.815 align:middle line:90%
called seventh generation.

01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:18.690 align:middle line:90%
You might have heard.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a line of cleaning
products at Whole Foods

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.190 align:middle line:90%
called Seventh Generation.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So that comes from the great
law of the Iroquois nation.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And in their sort of
Bible, let's call it,

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
for monotheistic purposes, they
say that every time the elders

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
make a decision
for the tribe, they

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
have to consider the
impact of that decision

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
on the seventh
generation to follow.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very forward-looking
decision-making process.

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think religion,
at its best, is that.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I often put it to people--

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I think to be a religious person
means that you are choosing

01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
to live as a good ancestor.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't think of
ourselves as ancestors.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.640 align:middle line:90%
We are, just not yet.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So our job is to
be good ancestors,

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and that means to think about
the future more than the past.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are
religions, though,

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that think that their
religion is the only way,

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and that other religions
would say that they're

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
the basis of all religion.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Yeah.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
one path, of course.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Judaism
is my religion.

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's my love.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I love my wife.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We got engaged on
our second date.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.020 align:middle line:90%
We've been married 33 years.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that someone
loves his wife any less?

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But this is my wife,
and that's your wife.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great example.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Love isn't limited.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's limitless.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I think all true
religions are a path of love,

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're of equal beauty,
but they're different.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes think
differences are bad.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't see things that way.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I think differences
are beautiful.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's this great shot of him.

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
He's half in shadow,
half in light,

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
but he has a kind of
disinterested look on his face.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
about this photograph

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
is if you look really
carefully-- now, remember,

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.135 align:middle line:84%
he's a big star
already at this point.

If you look really
carefully, you

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:50.080 align:middle line:10%

years old, 10 years old.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.940 align:middle line:10%
I remember in this
little elementary school

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.960 align:middle line:10%
in suburban Minneapolis, there
was a girl in the class--

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.040 align:middle line:10%
I won't mention her name.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a girl in the class

You know, in 1970, we

about going to the teacher, Mrs.

saying, you know

01:08:39.093 --> 01:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:50.859 align:middle line:10%
was that here's a person
who's clearly suffering.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.899 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to help.

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:58.529 align:middle line:84%
And for as long as I can
remember, that's been my why.

did talk to her?

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: No.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:01.800 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.127 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've talked
to plenty others.

01:09:04.127 --> 01:09:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: I've tried.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I've tried my best.

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
you've made up for it.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.429 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much--

01:09:07.429 --> 01:09:08.229 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Thank you.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --for showing us how
grief can truly transform us

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:12.889 align:middle line:84%
and how suffering
can transform us.

01:09:12.889 --> 01:09:13.689 align:middle line:90%
>>LEDER: Thank you.

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful for the
opportunity to speak with you.

01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:16.630 align:middle line:90%
