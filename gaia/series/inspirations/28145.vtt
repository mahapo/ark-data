00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:17.281 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:10%
Do you feel that
food controls you?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that the
brain has the same chemical

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
reaction to sugary
and fatty foods

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:10%
that it has to
cocaine or nicotine?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And this chemical
reaction happens

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:10%
even before you eat the food if
you even just think about it.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to end
that battle with food?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Today's topic is
for anyone who wants

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to end the food addictions
or the hunger cravings

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:90%
once and for all.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Pam Peeke is joining me.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
She's a physician, scientist,
Pew Foundation scholar

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in nutrition and metabolism,
and nationally renowned

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:90%
expert in integrative medicine.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Peeke is a "New York
Times" best-selling author,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
whose latest book
"The Hunger Fix:

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the Three-Stage
Detox and Recovery

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Plan for Overeating
and Food Addiction,"

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
it reveals that food
addiction is real.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a science-based
blueprint for detox

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and lifelong recovery.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, hello there, Lisa.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You shed a lot of light
on this for a lot of us.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
How did you first begin
to realize that food

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
is actually an addiction?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's interesting.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It was my patients.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
They would come
in, and they would

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
have drug vernacular to describe
what was happening to them.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Gee, I need a hit of this.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't get off the stuff.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:10%
Withdrawal is killing me.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:10%
And after a while, you know,
I talked to my colleagues.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:10%
And I said, are they
all sounding like this?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:10%
And they said a growing
number of people

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:10%
are really using this
kind of vernacular.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:10%
Could there be something there?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there a relationship
between food and addiction?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what got me going.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So did you ever have an
issue yourself with food?

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.951 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
experience with being food

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
as an addiction?
I've said those things.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I need that cup of coffee.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Or I would die for some
sugar or for some chocolate.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, please.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is America.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.324 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:12.491 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have some
kind of issue with food,

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
you'd be un-American.
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:90%
So of course I've had it.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is another reason
why I can really relate to it.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I think all of us can.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
When we sit down, close
our eyes, and say,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is there one particular
food product--

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
now, mind you I have
to say "food product"

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
because most of these
are science fair projects

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.967 align:middle line:84%
or food-like products.
LISA: Mm--

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So you know where
I'm going on that.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
LISA: They're the most
addictive ones are those, right?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.066 align:middle line:84%
You know, close
your eyes and say,

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is there one thing that I was
eating that, after I ate it,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt completely
out of control?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Then, you're on a bender.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And you just don't feel right.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're not even getting
the right satisfaction

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:90%
from it anymore.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
wrong there.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So scientists began to
explore this entire arena.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So here are some
questions that you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
can ask yourself to find out
if you have a food addiction.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So when life gets hard, is
it your first impulse to eat?

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:10%
Do you stockpile "emergency"
snacks in your desk, closet,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:10%
or nightstand?

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:10%
Do you-- do you have to know
where your next meal or food

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:10%
source is going to be
at all times to feel--

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:10%
or you feel nervous
or panicky or "off"?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:10%
In times of high
emotion, do you sometimes

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:10%
find yourself
eating even when you

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:10%
feel no physical hunger at all?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:10%
So emotional eating.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:10%
Does your relationship
with certain foods

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:10%
cause you have feelings
of shame or guilt

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:10%
or disgust or self-loathing?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:10%
Is food your best friend
or your worst enemy?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:10%
Actually, your best friend
and your worst enemy

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.353 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I mean, this is a rock and
a rolling kind of relationship

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:90%
people have with food.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, they
use it for comfort.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:90%
We already know that.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you eat
these kinds of foods

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking
about, we actually

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
call them the
hyperpalatables, which

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
are the sugary, starchy,
fatty, salty combinations.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
They actually, in the short
term, reduce stress hormone.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
You basically go into kind of
a food numbness, an anesthetic.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
But that wears off very quickly.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Then, you wake up out of it.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, my gosh,
what have I just done?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
This is when you wake up in
bed, and you've got wrappers

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and cartons all over the bed.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly realize what
you've just done after you've

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:90%
come out of your food coma.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Or you've bottomed out the
chip bag, and you realize--

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Oh, yeah.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
How did I do that?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Or the other one is that
wonderful menage a trois people

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
have at night time,
especially women,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
watching endless re-runs
of "Law and Order"

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:90%
with your two best friends.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a menage a trois,
you, Ben, and Jerry in bed

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:90%
together, all of you.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yes.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, how long does
that last, though?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
How long does the relaxation
part of the eating last?

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Does it last for the whole
time you eat the food?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
No, it's very interesting.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.955 align:middle line:84%
If you really feel
out of control

00:04:56.955 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
with these kinds of foods,
then you're eating with frenzy.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no real savoring
and really getting into it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It's-- you're just going at
it with angst and frenzy.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So relaxation's really
not a piece of it.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:90%
What it is is numbing.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
It's anesthetizing you.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you're stressed out
and you're feeling funky one

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
way or the other and
you've got these foods,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, flying
through your mouth,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
then you just go from
angst to numb, basically.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of the science around this.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
What does the
brain actually look

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
like on these food addictions?
-OK.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, for the longest
period of time,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
scientists have really
wanted to explore

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that one part of the
brain that we know

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
is already affected by
drugs, for instance,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and alcohol, so as it
were, validated addictions.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reward
center of the brain.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:10%
When you look at brain scans,
what you'll actually find

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:10%
is if you look at a binge
eater, for instance, as compared

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:10%
to someone who doesn't
binge, and you actually just

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:10%
give them the simple cue
that a food is actually

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:10%
coming or just the sight of it.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:10%
But they haven't
even eaten it yet.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:10%
What you're actually noticing is
the red there is the dopamine.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:10%
And that is the neurotransmitter
that is associated with reward

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:10%
and pleasure in the brain.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:10%
The dopamine in
the control subject

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
is basically pretty normal.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:10%
They have a little bit
more dopamine coming up.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:10%
They're excited.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:10%
They see it.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
the binge eater,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:10%
wow, the dopamine
just disappears as

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:10%
soon as they've seen that food.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:10%
And that is because,
one, they've

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:10%
been hyperconditioned to it.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And two, because they don't
even secrete that much.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have that
many dopamine receptors

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pick it
up because over time,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:90%
that entire system changes.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.291 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
sees a commercial--

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
When someone sees a
billboard, this reaction

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:90%
happens in the brain.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.223 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Absolutely.

00:06:52.223 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It could even be looking
at someone who you usually

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:90%
hang out with when you overeat.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It could be that subtle.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The cues are everywhere
in our environment.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It could be the chair
you're sitting in.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the chair
you always have binges in.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
What if I think about it?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.659 align:middle line:84%
-That's all it is.
-You're kidding.

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just a thought.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
these cues are.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The reward center
in the brain is

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
exquisitely sensitive to this.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so dopamine gets secreted
immediately in response

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to these kinds of
cues, especially

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
in people like binge eaters,
compulsive eaters, and people

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:90%
who are addicted to food.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So the dopamine is the
feel-good element of the brain?

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that what makes
us feel high or good?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a brain chemical that
is associated with anything

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that has to do with reward.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
It helps you with
motivation for reward.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You want to get
that college degree.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It gives you short term
gratification, long term.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has to do with
reward, promoting reward

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
is all about dopamine.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine's in charge of that.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, the receptors
receive the dopamine.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a
cascade or a flood--

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
or you give the analogy
in the book, which I think

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.781 align:middle line:84%
was brilliant, of a
flood going down a river.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Mm-hm.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And it overcomes the river
and goes over the bank.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.311 align:middle line:84%
So it blows out, say, the
dopamine receptor for trees.

00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Right?
DR. PEEKE: That's right.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, so what ends up happening
in the brain of someone who

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is at first-- let's just
say right off the bat,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:90%
you came from Amazon.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're gonna
come to America,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
and you're gonna find sugary,
fatty, starchy, salty,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
substances everywhere.
Right?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly, these are
real hyperpalatable rewards.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots of dopamine
starts being secreted.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So much so, over a period of
time-- not just once, but over

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
a period of time-- that
your receptors which

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
have to manage all
of this dopamine

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
basically become
absolutely overwhelmed.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The brain realizes it can't
process this amount of dopamine

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
coming in, that river.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It can't process it.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So instead, it takes
the actual receptors,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and it does something
we call downregulating.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It means it turns
off and deactivates

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
most of these receptors.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, someone who
has an addiction,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it's alcohol, cocaine,
meth, or food-- right?

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:90%
They have fewer receptors.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
These are called D2 receptors.
-Ah.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We can actually
see this on scans.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So what this does
is the brain actually

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.789 align:middle line:84%
turns against you then.
Right?

00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it
does is it doesn't

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%
understand what's happening.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the brain is all
geared to one thing, Lisa--

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
survival.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if it sees
that you're getting

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
this huge rush all the time,
it tries to control this.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And it controls this
by downregulating

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
those dopamine receptors so
that you don't get overwhelmed.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
What unfortunately happens
is you start a vicious cycle.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Because now, when I want to get
re-exposed to that particular

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
food stuff-- let's just say that
cupcake rolls around again--

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:90%
then I eat the cupcake.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I even see the cue
for the cupcake.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not feeling
as much reward

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
because the dopamine receptors
are decreased in number.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not getting
as much reward.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:90%
So guess what happens?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:90%
You guessed it.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I have to have not
one, but five cupcakes

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to get the same reward
I got originally.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.259 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Huh.
So this--

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- well, this is the
same thing happens in drugs.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
One moment, you have just one
hit of crack or, you know--

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Or heroine.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The next time, you're
just running at it.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So what the brain
looks-- this is

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
a-- we actually
have a slide here

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.306 align:middle line:84%
of what the brain
looks like when it's

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
swelled with this dopamine.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Is this what it looks like?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: OK, well, so
this is a beautiful picture

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at here is how much

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:90%
the brain enhances expectation.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So remember how I told
you about the cue.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
All I have to say is, you
know, in about two hours, Lisa,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:90%
we're gonna have a cupcake.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Or and if that turns out
to be something that's

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
one of your binge-able,
cravable, what

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I love to call "false fixes."
All right?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up
happening is you suddenly

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
realize that where that
orange is just lit up,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
turned on, that you have
dopamine flooding in,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:90%
enhancing expectation.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
question by scientists

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
in this one
particular experiment

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
was how long does
that expectation last?

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
How long can you
keep that dopamine

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:90%
enhancing that feeling?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
80% of the subjects
in the experiment

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
kept it going for 24 hours.
-After they--

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
-It just keeps going and going--
-Oh, my goodness.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:90%
 --and going.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.084 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't one of those, oh,
wow, what a wonderful thought.

00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, it just, you
know, flittered off--

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
- --and ended.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.359 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
This can keep-- this
is why people obsess.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
This explains the
epidemic that we have

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:90%
in this country of obesity.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this explains the
trouble that we're in.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
chemical reaction.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But most people wouldn't
think of food as a drug.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, you see, I'll betcha
people watching this interview

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.931 align:middle line:84%
would say, I'm not an addict.
You know?

00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And you have all these terrible
thoughts about, you know,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
addicts in, you know, the
end of allies or something.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, how many of you

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
have fished through
a garbage can,

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, to find
that cupcake again.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
No, but seriously, as it
turns out, in all seriousness,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.990 align:middle line:84%
at the National
Institutes of Health all

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world, we've
been looking at the science

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:90%
of food and addiction.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And we finally hit
a tipping point.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We realized that through all
of the new tools that we have,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the PET scans, the functional
MRIs, and all of these lovely

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
scans that you've been
seeing, that we now understand

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that there is a very
striking relationship

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
between food and addiction.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And for that matter,
the same centers

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that regulate drug
addiction also regulate food.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's what's shocking.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And food is
available everywhere.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Well--

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, drugs are illegal.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:90%
But the food is everywhere.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it more
tempting and more

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
up to us to use will power.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Well, you see,
here's another issue.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be getting into this.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But in your brain,
there's a battle going on.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got the reward
system that's been hijacked

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
by these hyperpalatables.
Because come on.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's just get
real here for a minute.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You got a bowl of berries,
fresh berries, whole foods.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, you've got
this huge, steaming,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, warm, strawberry
tart with a cream

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
center and all the gooey--
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.889 align:middle line:84%
Give me a break.
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think--
I mean, come on.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's get real
here for a minute.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.507 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, don't think for
a second the food industry

00:13:47.507 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
hasn't figured this out either.
-Right.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Right.
-So there it is.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
well, gosh, is everyone

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:90%
affected by food addiction?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I would say not everyone.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I would probably say
the majority of people.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wide
spectrum of, you know,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
people who have a
mild food addiction

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to people who have very striking
and serious food addiction.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And these people also tend to
be cross-addicted, many of them,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning they have
other addictions

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
both genetically and
otherwise, like alcohol,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
cigarettes, drugs.
LISA: Interesting.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's-- it's not
just the food addiction.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It goes generationally,
which is also--

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got--
all of a sudden,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
you've got this cross-linking
between all of these addictions

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that just sort of increases
the intensity of all addictions

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
by an order of magnitude
over people who just

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
simply have food addiction.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.535 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So we have
a slide about that

00:14:43.535 --> 00:14:46.014 align:middle line:84%
that shows the cross-linking
that you're talking about.

00:14:46.014 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Well, actually,
you know, what this one

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:90%
is is very interesting.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a slide that shows the
brain, one of those centers

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of the brain in
the reward center

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that also is highly
associated with overeating.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to look
at an animal experiment

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to see whether or not there
was any cross-linking between

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:90%
overeating and cocaine abuse.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, it's
either one or the other.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't have both
at the same time.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
When you stimulate
for food, what

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
you see is a decrease in
interest in both cocaine

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
as well as what we call
"novelty behavior,"

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you want-- you're
exploring your environment.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
You're taking risks.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So taking risk and
cocaine go together.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
When those are stimulated, food
and appetite are decreased.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It's either one or the other.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:10%
But they're happening at the
same center in the brain,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:10%
which we never knew.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is either seeking
food or it's taking risk.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's not seeking the food
and the risk at the same time.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And the risk is most highly
associated with drugs and drug

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:90%
addiction, not with food.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Could you say that
the brain could

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
be interested in goal
setting or pleasure--

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
other types of pleasures and
not be interested in food

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.021 align:middle line:84%
So if you say you want to go
out and play with your child.

00:16:13.021 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Of course.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Does that decrease
your desire for food?

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.003 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Oh, no, no no.

00:16:16.003 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
See what happens here is
you're-- you know, that

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:90%
question is excellent, Lisa.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
playing with your daughter

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're having so much fun,
the last thing on your mind

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is--
LISA: Right.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
 --hey, man, I need
to score a candy bar.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Exactly.
-It just doesn't happen.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you-- actually,
it's the reason why I called it

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:90%
"The Hunger Fix."

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
What do you really hunger for?
-Mm.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And what you want is
a rich, wonderful life,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:90%
like enjoying your daughter.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the false
hungers of the food

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
addictions which
drag you from that.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Because what we found, in both
animal experiments and human,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
when you're in full
on, blowout addiction,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't care
about your family.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't care about
your obligations

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and responsibilities.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't care about your work.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:90%
You don't care about self-care.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Mm.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
You let it all
go for one thing.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is the foraging to
be able to find that food.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
For that matter, in
animal experiments,

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
if we electrified the floor and
we had the hyperpalatable food

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
that they got conditioned
to on the other side

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
of that electrified floor,
these animals don't care.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.654 align:middle line:84%
They'll come right
across, get injured--

00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Oh.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
 --in the seeking for this
because they want it that much.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And boy, I'll tell you there's
some people watching this right

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
now who could raise their
hand and say, been there, done

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that, probably
doing it right now.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
LISA: I would--
yes, yes, exactly.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Get electrified for food.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, though,
because when you exercise

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
or when you work out, you
always say, oh, I'm not hungry.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You know it's-- you don't
feel hungry if you're finding

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
something that excites you or
is interesting to you, even

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:90%
if it's exercising or playing.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you about
putting up, say, pictures

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:90%
of how you want to look.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Or I noticed you have an awesome
picture of you as a triathlete,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
just stunning, you
know, in your glory

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:90%
in that fit place of your life.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Does that give you
the same reward

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and make you not want the food?

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Would it work?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's interesting.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.081 align:middle line:84%
In my book, there's a choice
of false fix or healthy fix.

00:18:20.081 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA: OK.
-OK?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So my healthy fix is
that I'm a triathlete.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm out there
doing my little thing.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And I keep pictures.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
These are my cues.
LISA: Ah.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:90%
These are healthy cues.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Healthy case.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.249 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
LISA: Very good.

00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're cues that
remind me, oh, my gosh.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, I
remember how much fun it was

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.891 align:middle line:84%
to hit the lake that morning,
and that bike ride was amazing,

00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
All from one little cue that
happens to be my screen saver

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.361 align:middle line:84%
on my computer that you saw.
-Brilliant.

00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: OK?
-Yeah.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: So healthy cues
are extremely important.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
asking also is that,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
can I do battle with the false
fixes with my healthy fixes?

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Can I take my
healthy cues and do

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
battle with the false fix cues?
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:90%
My answer is absolutely yes.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
that has to happen.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is I have to have one
part of my brain beefed up,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
strengthened, empowered to
be able to make that happen.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the prefrontal
cortex of the brain,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
right here, smack dab in here.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
That's known as the brain's CEO.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Or what we say in food
and addiction research,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
it's the brain's
braking mechanism.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able
to say no when you

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
need to say no when
the prefrontal cortex

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:90%
is really empowered and strong.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
tell you something.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:84%
When you're in full on,
out of control addiction,

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
whether it's food or
cocaine or whatever,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal
cortex is damaged.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It's impaired--
LISA: Wow.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
 --so that you cannot
rein in impulsivity at all.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So when food people
say, well, gosh.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
You know, come on.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just a cupcake.
-Mm.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just a piece of candy.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just use moderation.
Right?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Moderation is a moot point
when your prefrontal cortex

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
is impaired.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.865 align:middle line:84%
That's like walking
up to an alcoholic--

00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
 --you know, through-- and
he's already been through three

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
bottles of wine and
saying, just one glass,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:90%
that's all you really need.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.201 align:middle line:84%
You'll be fine.
LISA: So--

00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Really?
-Mm.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: I don't think so.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So the more you have
the cupcakes and the more

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that you fall to that
false fix, the more damage

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.335 align:middle line:84%
you're doing to the
prefrontal cortex.

00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:27.201 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: That's correct.

00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So that it's
becoming completely

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:84%
impaired for you to be able
to stop that in the future.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: That's
absolutely right.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And I want to say something.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I used a cupcake on
my cover as an icon.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
plenty of people

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
out there who can be more
than happy to have one cupcake

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and be perfectly-- you
know, walk away and not

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:90%
feel out of control.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I only use it as an icon to
say that it could represent

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
any one of a bunch of
binge-able, cravable foods

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that end up being false
fixes that lead you to feel

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
like you're out of
control and then decrease

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the dopamine receptors and
lead you to that whole cascade

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of changes, the
organic changes that

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
actually happen in your brain.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:90%
How did we get this way?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did we get
this way as a nation?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We-- is it because there's
so many processed foods now,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:90%
more than ever before?

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what happened.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We sort of fell
into a land mine.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:10%
All right, Lisa, why
are we here today?

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that you
and I can sit here

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.665 align:middle line:10%
today and have this
marvelous conversation

00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:10%
and help other people?

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Two things.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.461 align:middle line:10%
One, sex.
All right?

00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:10%
-OK.
-So we've been procreating.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Somebody's been procreating--
-To get us here.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:10%
 --to get us here.
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know, "Fifty
Shades of Gray"

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
aside, we're still sort
of doing it the same way,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:90%
you know, shackles optional.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
the sex part of it.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The food part of it is
where we really went awry.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Our brains were set
up for survival.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So sex and food, terribly
important for survival.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We are very attracted to fatty
foods because we have to.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Because fat gives us fuel.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And fuel helps us be able to get
through famine and tough times

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:90%
when we can't score food.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We like sugary stuff,
but natural sugars.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.641 align:middle line:84%
So when raspberries are in
the bush or back and forth.

00:22:16.641 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
-Fruits.
-We love that.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if we weren't attracted
to it, we wouldn't eat it.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:90%
We'd starve to death.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:90%
So all of that's great.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was when we
started manufacturing food that

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:84%
wasn't whole food-- it wasn't
the apples, the bananas,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.739 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of it.
Right?

00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
When we started
manufacturing food,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
we made it uber-palatable.
LISA: Mm.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
We made it over-the-top
palatable so that, once again,

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
if you had that bowl of
fruit compared to the big,

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
gooey, you know,
strawberry tart, come on.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:90%
What are you gonna go for?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what ended
up happening was

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:84%
our brains became conditioned
to this kind of food

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
so that this became the
real rewarding food,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:90%
and this was like blah.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like food
is a prescription.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like food is,
as you say, a drug.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It's pharmaceutical food.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, you know,
Hippocrates was right.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.445 align:middle line:90%
"Let food be thy medicine."

00:23:15.445 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Mm.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.101 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, if it was
whole foods, it's natural.

00:23:19.101 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Mm-hm.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going right into you
the way it's supposed to.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's matching up with
your genes, et cetera.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you have these
hyperpalatables, most of these

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
are what I call
science fair projects.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yep, science food.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, the
whole foods is what

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.715 align:middle line:90%
does not set up that addiction.

00:23:33.715 --> 00:23:34.767 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: That's correct.

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, when's the last time
you met someone who said,

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
oh, my god, I just have to
do apples in the closet?

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work that way.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I wish they were
addicted to apples.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't work that well.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, honestly, I
mean, we had lunch together.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And you said, I want
my leafy greens.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I want my green food.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: That's right.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's
gonna give you your energy.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.223 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Absolutely.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You know that from a
scientific perspective.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, my genes are happy.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know more
about that soon.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So talk to me
about the experiment

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
that happened with the mice.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I've told
everybody that there

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:90%
is food and addiction.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
They're probably out there, you
know, wiping the little tears

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.045 align:middle line:84%
from their eyes going,
oh, my gosh, what

00:24:11.045 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:90%
am I gonna do about all this?

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.336 align:middle line:84%
The good news is I never write
a book without a good ending.

00:24:15.336 --> 00:24:16.035 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.035 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
I have a solution,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
which means even more new
science, which is so exciting.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It's called epigenetics.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm gonna
explain what happened

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
with the birth of epigenetics
which, by the way,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.831 align:middle line:84%
only took place
in the year 2007.

00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
-Great.
-All right.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happened.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Randy Jirtle, a scientist
at Duke University,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
decided to take a strain of
mice called the Agouti mice.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Agouti mice,
the poor little things,

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
were basically bred to
be floppy, fat, yellow,

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
because the yellow color was
tied in with the activation

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
of their fat gene.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, what they did was they
decided to take the females,

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to
just do one thing,

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:90%
feed them something different.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the junk they usually
ate, feed them something that

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
gave them methyl
donors to shut down,

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
clamp down the gene that
was making them fat.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So they went ahead
and fed these mothers,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, leafy greens,
folate, a lot of B vitamins.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
they had pups.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And everyone waited.
You know?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
that the pups, instead

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
of being floppy and yellow
and also destined to die young

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
from all kinds of diseases,
ended up being lean and brown,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
meaning that simply
using leafy greens

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
shut down the Agouti gene,
which is the obesity gene.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to breed completely

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
normal mice with no disease
that could live a long life.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Thus was the birth
of epigenetics,

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:84%
which means that you have
control over gene expression,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:84%
no matter what your mother
and father gave you.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.797 align:middle line:84%
So this was done in one
generation with the mice?

00:25:58.797 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: This was
done in one generation.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And it affected multiple
generations, proving

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:90%
that DNA is not destiny.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Ah.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Your lifestyle choices are.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to find
out, though, is if we can

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:90%
change this in our lifetime.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're gonna come back
to give you that answer.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:24.431 align:middle line:10%
We'll be right back with Dr.
Pam Peeke and "The Hunger Fix."

00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back.
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And my guest is Dr. Pam Peeke.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
"The Hunger Fix."

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Before the break, we were
talking about the mice.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they actually
changed their diet,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
they could change the
effects of their offspring.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But what about
during the lifetime

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:90%
of that particular mouse?

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Could they actually
change their body type

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.005 align:middle line:90%
by changing their diet?

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things we
found actually was even better.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to
look at mice for this.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.725 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Right.
-We could look at humans.

00:26:50.725 --> 00:26:51.424 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Great.

00:26:51.424 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And we could actually find that
people can take their genes.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say you had a gene
that gave you big time risk

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
for obesity, big time risk for
diabetes and heart disease,

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:10%
You can actually dampen
that down big time

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:10%
by doing nothing more than just
some nutritional interventions,

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:10%
very much like the mice.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:10%
It's extraordinary
how powerful this is.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:10%
But those genes can
be affected by that.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:24.181 align:middle line:84%
That's what epigenetics is.
"Epi" means "around the gene."

00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And "genetics" means
"gene," obviously.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And you've got these
little proteins

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
called histones that are just
hanging out around the gene.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And they watch what you do.
Oh, no.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:90%
She's gonna eat a Twinkie.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
All right, so then
if you do that,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
then they give-- they're like
a speechwriter for the gene.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:84%
They write a speech saying, oh,
boy, erode the immune system

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and set up allergic
reactions all over her body.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Versus, oh, look.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
She's gonna eat
an apple instead.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, we change the
script completely.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Say, oh, now empower
the immune system.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Give her the fantastic
phytonutrients

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that come from that apple,
all the wonderful vitamins,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:90%
minerals, et cetera.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So the domino effect
comes from whatever

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:90%
speech is being written.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of the gene
that you were born with,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
you can actually modify it by
your own lifestyle choices,

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
meaning how you
think, how you eat,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and how you move your body.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I call it mind,
mouth, and muscle.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually up towards
a plate of very healthy food

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and say to yourself, this
is going to feed my body

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in everything that it needs.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And it actually does.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.681 align:middle line:84%
It actually does feed your body
in every way that it needs.

00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, but you
know what I do, Lisa.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It's even funnier.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.136 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
know if you heard

00:28:37.136 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
me say under my breath when we
were having our lunch together,

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
when I had all my nice,
leafy greens and my protein,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:90%
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But as I looked at my food, I
said, oh, look, happy genes.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:90%
My genes are happy.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now speech writing great
things right now to the rest

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of my body, versus if I
had a plate of nasty stuff,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
science fair projects

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.812 align:middle line:84%
and the hyperpalatables,
in which case forget it.

00:29:00.812 --> 00:29:02.445 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to know
what the speech writing

00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:03.245 align:middle line:90%
looked like on that one.

00:29:03.245 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna say so you could
tell yourself, oh, this cupcake

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:90%
is really good for me.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And it completely never
is going to be, right?

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.626 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: But do
you know what it is?

00:29:09.626 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It's the food-gene connection.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:84%
We finally have the
tools to measure

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:90%
how this actually happens.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here
is we have a slide

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that shows the difference
between the control

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and the cocaine abuser.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: So the reason why we
have this slide is to show what

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:84%
happens-- speaking of
food-- with glucose

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
metabolism in the brain.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see in
the cocaine abuser,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
there's an area
up above, what we

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:90%
call the orbitofrontal cortex.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a
lot of this reward

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
system and addiction action
takes place in the brain.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the normal
control, what you'll

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.060 align:middle line:84%
see is tons and
tons of wonderful,

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, activation when you
see something, for instance.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's all good.
Right?

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
a cocaine abuser,

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.570 align:middle line:84%
almost nothing's
happening up there

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
because the glucose metabolism
in that part of the brain

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:90%
is eroded.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
It's impaired after year
after year, day after day,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
week after week, month
after month abuse.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, finally, you actually have
impaired ability of the brain

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to take its own nutrients
from whatever you eat

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and actually use it to
repair and function,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:84%
which is why
cocaine abusers have

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
issues with thinking,
cognitive abilities,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of it.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
called the false fix.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: You got it.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
we found is happening

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:90%
in people with food addiction.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So that false fix, that
reaching for those chips, that

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:84%
reaching for that food creates
that same exact chemical

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:90%
reaction in the brain.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's an organic reaction.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing thing.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But now, we have the
scans to prove it.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:54.121 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you mentioned the
solutions were these three M's.

00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And go through them
a little bit deeper.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, mind, mouth, and muscle.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you want to
do-- what did I tell you before?

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I said you're gonna
have to duel it out

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
in your brain with a
hijacked reward system

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because those
hyperpalatables are holding

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:90%
onto that reward system.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
reclaim your brain.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
without having a very

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
strong prefrontal cortex.
LISA: Cortex.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
How do you rebuild that?

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: OK.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
you do is you meditate.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
This is not earthy,
crunchy time.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not, you know,
some new age-y, you know,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:90%
newfangled idea.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This is solid, hard
core, credible science.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We took two different
forms of meditation that

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.840 align:middle line:84%
are more structured,
transcendental meditation and

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness-based meditation.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
These are easy to study
because, again, they have

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:90%
more of a structure to them.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we were able to find
using the same kind of scans,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the PET scans as well
as the functional MRIs,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:84%
is that when you do regular
meditation, not just sporadic,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
but regular meditation,
you actually

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:90%
activate the prefrontal cortex.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:84%
You could see activation
of that part of the brain.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
You're also inducing
neurogenesis.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:90%
You're making more brain cells.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.560 align:middle line:84%
You're carving new
brain circuits,

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:84%
pathways in the brain, so that
you will default to a better

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
place to say no when
you need to say no,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
versus having an eroded and
impaired prefrontal cortex.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is extremely
powerful for this.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.506 align:middle line:84%
If you're not meditating now,
honey, you are so last year.

00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:27.860 align:middle line:84%
OK?
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
-OK.
-Come on.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Get with the program.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:84%
The nutrition part of this,
which is the mouth part

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:90%
of this, is very important.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Clearly when you're eating
whole foods, clearly

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
when your genes are happy,
part of that domino effect

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:90%
is neurogenesis.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:90%
You're building a bigger brain.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're building,
again, augmenting

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that same kind of
circuitry that I just

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
talked about with meditation.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, here we go to muscle.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Bet you didn't
know, but if you're

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.145 align:middle line:84%
doing regular
physical activity--

00:32:54.145 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean you have
to join the Olympic camp.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean walking on
a routine basis

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and maybe adding a little
bit more intensity to it

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:84%
when you can.
Right?

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
If you do that,
you're increasing

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
the size of your brain.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You're getting a bigger brain.
LISA: Mm.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
At the same time--
are you ready for this?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Studies have shown
that if you were

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.140 align:middle line:84%
born with the worst
obesity gene--

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:84%
it's called the FTO gene.
-OK.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Born with a worse obesity gene.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And you thought, oh, no.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
DNA is my destiny, and
I'm going to be obese.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:84%
By simply walking on a
routine, regular basis,

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis, you can
dampen down that gene by 40%.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you add the methyl
donors from what you're eating,

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:90%
you dampen it down even further.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
No, you do not have to be obese.
-Interesting.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's amazing.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So what do you feel about the
"calories out, calories in"

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:90%
concept?

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're saying that you can
actually override the reward

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
system of the brain by giving
it positive food with the mind,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
with the exercise, and
with the meditation,

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
what do you think about
calories out, calories in?

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see here,
the problem I have

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:90%
with that is, what calories?

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tell you think about
the quality of the calories.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I could have two candy
bars for 600 calories,

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:84%
or I could end up
having, you know,

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:84%
two meals and a snack of
whole foods that are life

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:90%
giving for 600 calories.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Which one are you going for?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't speak to
the issue of quality.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at quality here.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Because quality is what
your genes are asking for.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:90%
They're saying, come on, man.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to have, you know,
the right kind of speech

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
to be able to give to
the rest of the body.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I can't speech write
something positive if you're

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:90%
giving me trash to eat.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It won't work.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.559 align:middle line:84%
All right?
-Interesting.

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:84%
Give me something compatible
with my genes and my body.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:49.721 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the whole foods
are literally healing foods.

00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:84%
-That--
-You know?

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And they'll just get you
out of this whole food

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:54.980 align:middle line:90%
addiction cycle.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of which, it's
detox and recovery.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:84%
"The Hunger Fix" is a book
that is a game changer.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The old fashioned
way was to simply,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.184 align:middle line:84%
you know, flip out a 1,200
calorie diet for everyone.

00:35:06.184 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Here's your diet.
Right.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.594 align:middle line:84%
You know, forget it.
Uh-uh.

00:35:08.594 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening anymore.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.490 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing now is
saying, wait a minute.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
You have organic biochemical
changes in your brain.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna have to detox
off what we call your crack.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You know what your crack is.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
salty, starchy foods.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.460 align:middle line:84%
For other people,
it's, you know, tons

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.126 align:middle line:84%
of bread with tons of butter.
LISA: Uh-huh.

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
For other people,
it's all sweets.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.882 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:35:30.882 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
You know what your crack
is because you feel

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:90%
out of control when you eat it.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So you take that,
and you eliminate it.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And what you then do
is you give yourself

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
incredibly wonderful,
healthy fixes in its place.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I actually
teamed with a phenomenal group

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of culinary nutritionists
who were able to sit down

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and do battle with all of
the false fixes with the most

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.020 align:middle line:84%
tasty, wonderful
recipes and food

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:84%
plans so that you can get
through a gentle detox

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.960 align:middle line:84%
over about four to six weeks
and then move onto Begin

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
a Recovery.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And in Begin a
Recovery, what you're

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:84%
doing there is practicing,
practicing, practicing,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:90%
practicing, every day.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Mind, mouth, muscle.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Keep refining.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.591 align:middle line:84%
You will slip.
You will fall.

00:36:17.591 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:90%
You will stand up.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
You will dust off
your little behind.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You will keep going, and you
will achieve what you need to

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to move
into the final phase which

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.400 align:middle line:90%
is Master Recovery.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're in Master
Recovery, it's circuitous.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:84%
You could come back if
you need to to detox

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.700 align:middle line:90%
if something happens to you.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.370 align:middle line:84%
One of my patients ended
up with breast cancer.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And she had to, you
know, go through surgery,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:90%
all the rest of it.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Eating was a little funky.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:84%
She came back through it,
right back up to Master.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.515 align:middle line:84%
You are so incredibly
motivating.

00:36:50.515 --> 00:36:51.931 align:middle line:84%
Can I just have you
in my living room?

00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean it.
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
No, the book is amazing because
it makes so much clear sense.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.690 align:middle line:84%
You use so much
science to validate

00:36:58.690 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:90%
what you're talking about.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, it gives
recipes, which is the best.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But I have to ask you,
do you eliminate it

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:90%
completely forever?

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Can I never have my,
you know, my Americana

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:90%
with vanilla again?

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.580 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Well, here's
what's interesting.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.471 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to
identify your crack.

00:37:14.471 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
OK?
Whatever it may be.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And some people, all they
have to do is see a drugstore.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a cue.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And inside are the
big bags of candy

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that they used to
buy at the drugstore.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:84%
One of my patients, you
know, had this issue.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So for her, just being near
these big bags of candy

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
was a huge problem for
her for a very long time.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But you have to ask
yourself why would you want

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.670 align:middle line:90%
to be exposed to crappy candy?

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want
that again anyway?

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's very different
than if you were asking me,

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I have some
issues with oatmeal raisin

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.240 align:middle line:84%
cookies, and the next thing you
know, I'm eating 12 of them.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Can I ever have an oatmeal
raisin cookie again?

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The question is
answered this way.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
One, if you have
crossaddictions-- if you're

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
a smoker or have been,
alcoholic or you've had issues,

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
or it's strongly in your
family, drugs, whatever else,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:90%
the answer is probably no.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You probably should
not be re-exposed again

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:84%
because you just have too strong
a vulnerability in that area.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If, however, none of that's
true, if you have a mild food

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
addiction that it's
under control now,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
you've shed whatever weight
you need to, you already have

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
adopted all these other
habits, then ask yourself,

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
do I really need that food stuff
again and to revisit all this?

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Most people would say no.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:84%
What about the emotional part
of it, where you're looking

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
for that food or
that fix because you

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.740 align:middle line:84%
want to drown out some certain
emotion that's happening?

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, then take 10
steps back, Lisa.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Stress management.
All right?

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Why are you knee jerking
right back into a false fix?

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many other things you
can do, lots of other things

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
you can do that are
healthier fixes.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.260 align:middle line:84%
LISA: And that goes
back to the drug

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
reward circuit in the brain.
-Absolutely.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Which we have a slide of.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what it
looks like, right?

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.760 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: And so once
again, what you're looking at

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is you're looking at all of
the flooding of the dopamine

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
in people who have both, you
see a control, and the cocaine.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Tons and tons and
tons of that dopamine

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:84%
just secreted all the way
through these receptors.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Eventually what happens is these
receptors are gonna decrease

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
in number because the
body cannot handle

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.760 align:middle line:84%
the overwhelming amount of
dopamine that's showering

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.780 align:middle line:90%
upon it in the brain.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.005 align:middle line:84%
And so when the brain gets
overflooded with the dopamine

00:39:40.005 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and it gets into that place,
how do you get out of it?

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're
in that state

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of a complete out of control
binge, what do you do?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a very tough thing.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.870 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that is
really the main prerogative

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is to prevent this
in the first place.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
really on a bender,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that's a very
difficult thing to do.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's like telling--
that's like grabbing a bottle

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
out of the hand of an alcoholic
when they're really-- you know,

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:84%
they've already had
their first two glasses.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:90%
That's very tough.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
another reason why.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.800 align:middle line:84%
When you continuously re-expose
the body, the brain to whatever

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.575 align:middle line:84%
substance it may be,
it craves more and more

00:40:21.575 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:90%
at higher and higher levels.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, to stop it
is very difficult.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.180 align:middle line:10%
The whole issue with
"The Hunger Fix"

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:10%
is to prevent this
in the first place,

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:10%
to get you through that
detox and recovery,

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:10%
and keep you vigilant for
the rest of your life.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Because you're right, Lisa.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:10%
You brought it up perfectly.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:10%
Look at us in America.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.515 align:middle line:90%
There's cues everywhere.

00:40:43.515 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Radio, print media.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Thousands of times a day.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Online.
LISA: Yes.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
What people say.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
What people-- you
know, they may walk by.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting on an airplane.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They just brought a
whole bag of stuff

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to eat on the airplane with
you, right next to you.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:90%
So you can't control the cues.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: You
can't control them.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
always be there.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: But you can control
your response to the cues.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is why having a very
buffed up prefrontal cortex

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:90%
is where it's at.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.671 align:middle line:84%
That's why my motto in the book
is "big brain, small waist."

00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
-I love that.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
I loved about the book

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it's
not one solution.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.521 align:middle line:84%
It's a minute to
minute solution.

00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Right.
-Can you explain that?

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Every 24
hours-- you know,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
it's what you see in all
addiction treatment, per se.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is you
live for 24 hours.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't stress about what's
happening five years from now.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You live for 24 hours.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So you say to yourself, how can
I stop cavin' to the cravin'?

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:90%
How do I stop that?

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So you look at
every single hour.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:90%
How have I prepared?

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Do I have my appropriate foods?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And my avoiding, as best I can,
the people, places, and things

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:90%
that cue me and trigger me.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And you may have to change
up how and where you live

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.847 align:middle line:84%
and work to make this happen.
LISA: Interesting.

00:41:57.847 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I you're trying to get off
alcohol, working at a bar

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is probably not the
place to be, right?

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
ask you how do you

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:84%
coach your patients into
getting off of this addiction,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:90%
this false fix?

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I get them into detox.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, what I do is I
detox them immediately.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I have them just sit down, be
honest, tell their true truth.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.740 align:middle line:90%
What is your crack?

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.990 align:middle line:90%
What is your food crack?

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it may be, you go home.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:90%
You get it out of the house.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people actually
keep this around.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I'll just keep
the ice cream around,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.490 align:middle line:84%
just-- wink, wink-- in case.
Right?

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:90%
No, get it out of the house.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.471 align:middle line:84%
If it's something that's a
binge-able, cravable false fix,

00:42:35.471 --> 00:42:37.491 align:middle line:84%
get it out.
It's not working for you.

00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I have to do this
with my own husband.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I have no problems
with ice cream.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.960 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.940 align:middle line:84%
In all the years
we've been together,

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able to
keep ice cream in the house

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.960 align:middle line:90%
because it's unsafe around him.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's athletic, in great
shape, and all the rest of it.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if that stuff's
around, he'll start obsessing.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a cue.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And so everyone
has a strange one.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:90%
And you'd never expect it.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Men and women equally
have this problem.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I have this desire
for crunchy, salty.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.510 align:middle line:90%
That is my cue.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It's crunchy, salty.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.751 align:middle line:84%
And the minute it's in the
house, my husband eats it.

00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:15.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
DR. PEEKE: There it goes.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:16.734 align:middle line:90%
There it goes.

00:43:16.734 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all have
something different.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And he says don't
bring it in the house.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Mm-hm.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And he's right.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Absolutely.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of not putting
the foods in your house--

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and of course, you can
control your own environment.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But the outside environments,
what happens when

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:90%
there is an emotion attached?

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So have a friend who sets up
their vacations on the fact

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that you can go different
places in these areas

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to go eat because in the
past, her family went there.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good feeling that
she associated with food.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Well,
you know, again,

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.470 align:middle line:84%
in each one of those places,
are there foods that she can eat

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that are not
binge-able, cravables?

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And she has to start connecting
action with consequence.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you always want
to feel rotten

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:84%
after you've eaten something,
where you feel out of control

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and you've overeaten and
now you're in a big mess?

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that really what you want?

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:84%
When someone's in the
moment and they're

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.086 align:middle line:84%
really going through
an addictive feeling

00:44:12.086 --> 00:44:12.786 align:middle line:90%
and experience--

00:44:12.786 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Pattern, mm-hm.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The last thing on their
mind is the consequence.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
They want it now, yesterday.
Right?

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.585 align:middle line:84%
And so what she has to do
is go to all those places

00:44:21.585 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and maybe change up, you know,
something else on the menu.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if, again,
it's a problem,

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
it's not worth all this hassle.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So she can go to the place
if she can tolerate it.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But if the cues are too strong
and she caves each time,

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:90%
guess what.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time to
change the location.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.550 align:middle line:84%
If you have strengthened
the prefrontal cortex

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and if you've rebuilt
that up in your brain

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and when you see those
old cues, does it

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.891 align:middle line:84%
reverse the effects of all the
strengthening that you've done?

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:55.470 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: You know?
Not at all.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:84%
If you've strengthened the
prefrontal cortex, then

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.140 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing now-- and
this is one of the functions--

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the executive functions
of the prefrontal cortex--

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.260 align:middle line:84%
is it connects action
with consequence.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be saying to
yourself, it's not worth it.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:11.720 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Really?

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Not worth it.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Not worth it.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Well, now, do you
recommend any specific types

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of diets, like the raw
food diet over the gluten

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:90%
free or anything like that?

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.720 align:middle line:90%
No, no, not at all.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:84%
What I ask people to do
is experiment and find

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:90%
out what works best for them.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.090 align:middle line:84%
There is no one
diet for everyone.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.640 align:middle line:90%
For instance, I'm a triathlete.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.930 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I'd
ever do is have someone

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.050 align:middle line:84%
want to eat some of the foods
I eat when I know I'm gonna go

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:84%
out and do a lot of training.
LISA: Right.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It'd be silly.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make any sense.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.800 align:middle line:90%
You have your own thing.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.461 align:middle line:84%
You're a big time biker,
a master of the bike,

00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:48.891 align:middle line:84%
I might add.
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I do love it, yes.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.461 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: And you know how
you have to feed yourself.

00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yeah.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But look at someone
else who's maybe

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:84%
nowhere near as physically
active as either of us.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.890 align:middle line:84%
They have to have a way of
eating that works for them.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:84%
What I will tell you is
it better be whole foods.

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Whole foods.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's your main tip.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I have question
about will power.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:84%
When you say that willpower just
does not work, but isn't that

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:16.640 align:middle line:84%
what the willpower-- the
prefrontal cortex of the brain

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.547 align:middle line:84%
strengthened is?
Is willpower?

00:46:18.547 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.720 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: That's
the whole point.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Prefrontal cortex gives you the
discipline and the willpower

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get through
whatever you need to do, just

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.140 align:middle line:84%
power through, whether it's
a deadline you're writing

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it may be.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But if your reward
system is hijacked

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.970 align:middle line:84%
by the hyperpalatables,
then the prefrontal cortex

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.530 align:middle line:90%
is grossly impaired.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And it can't do that.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, when you're faced
with all these hyperpalatables

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you're
already starting

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.595 align:middle line:84%
to dig in, or back and forth,
willpower is a moot point.

00:46:51.595 --> 00:46:52.891 align:middle line:84%
It's right there
with moderation.

00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Forget it.
It's not going to happen.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You must have a strong
prefrontal cortex

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to face up
and to make battle with,

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:84%
do battle with, you know,
these hyperpalatables.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And it takes practice over time.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Lots of physical activity
on a routine basis.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Lots of whole foods.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Lots of meditation.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Meditation.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Put them all
together-- mind, mouth,

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:84%
muscle-- and you're armed,
locked, loaded, and dangerous.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, it makes a lot of sense.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.970 align:middle line:84%
You also mentioned that
there's three stages that come

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.664 align:middle line:84%
along with "The Hunger Fix."
DR. PEEKE: Right.

00:47:24.664 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about those?

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, we start
with detox always.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Identify your crack.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, you want
to be able to start

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.010 align:middle line:84%
substituting the healthy
fixes for the false fixes

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.820 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.800 align:middle line:84%
That's where this wonderful
food comes in place.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The food plans, the recipes
are meant specifically

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to fool the brain into thinking
you're having a hyperpalatable,

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.720 align:middle line:90%
but you're not.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So there will be some
sweetness involved,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.711 align:middle line:84%
but it's not refined sugar.
All right?

00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:90%
LISA: OK.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It'll come from
natural sources.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.180 align:middle line:90%
You'll have healthy fats to eat.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll have healthy
carbohydrates

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.340 align:middle line:90%
to be able to eat.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be
terribly satisfying.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The protein especially is
exquisitely satisfying.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You can do this all
the time so long as you

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.160 align:middle line:90%
stay consistent with that.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The minute you
re-expose yourself

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to one of the hyperpalatables
that got you going

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in the first place, you know,
you just back tread, you know,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.120 align:middle line:90%
28 steps.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You got to start
this all over again.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get through four
to six weeks of this--

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
because science has shown it
takes about four to six weeks

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to acclimate the brain, get
those neural circuits starting

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:90%
to be developed in your brain.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go right
into Begin a Recovery.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Begin a Recovery is
where you practice

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:90%
and practice and practice.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
take mind, mouth, muscle,

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and you refine and hone
every single skill in there.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a long time.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this isn't
an overnight thing.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Those silly ads that show
you overnight success--

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.340 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Lose 10 pounds, yeah.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is sure,
anybody can drop weight.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Anybody could drop 10 pounds.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The real success is keeping
it off for a lifetime.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to do that is
in a healthy way where you're

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:84%
building strong foundations
to be able to sustain

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:90%
this for a lifetime.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I love it.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, Master Recovery
is the highest level.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And Mastery is
simply the practice

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and practice and
practice again, but now

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.300 align:middle line:90%
at a much, much higher level.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying is
the most important thing

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.310 align:middle line:84%
is awareness of understanding
this chemical reaction

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:36.120 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that you're
in an addictive pattern,

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.619 align:middle line:84%
much like a drug addict.
DR. PEEKE: Right.

00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:38.820 align:middle line:90%
When you start to go off your--

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Organic changes.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Your false fixes.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And that awareness
enables you to stop

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:84%
reaching for the false
fixes and to slowly,

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:84%
one moment at a time, one
meal at a time, you know,

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:55.090 align:middle line:84%
one healthy fix at a time, to
rebuild the prefrontal cortex

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a
stronger base from which

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.102 align:middle line:90%
to say no to those false fixes.

00:49:59.102 --> 00:50:00.534 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:50:00.534 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know the nice thing
about this whole thing?

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
A stronger prefrontal
cortex helps you

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.640 align:middle line:84%
in every single
aspect of your life.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.501 align:middle line:84%
Because it also helps
you be creative.

00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It helps you--
LISA: Make better decisions.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Organize, strategize, think
about your life, go deep.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So you see you
get a huge win-win

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.360 align:middle line:90%
out of this entire thing.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Go after your purpose in life.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Find--

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Your hunger in life.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Your--

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.720 align:middle line:90%
What you're really hungry for.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So is it true
that if you really

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.610 align:middle line:84%
do take this on and
really change the way

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating, your eating
patterns, that it could last

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:34.840 align:middle line:90%
for a lifetime?

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Not only that, though.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're someone who's
going to have children,

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.410 align:middle line:84%
you will gift your children
with a brand new epigenome, one

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that you carefully
honed and carved,

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that will be transmitted to
them through your own epigenome,

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:53.450 align:middle line:90%
through your own genetics.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So that they'll be
born gifted and already

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.700 align:middle line:84%
equipped to be able to deal
with what goes on in the brain.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.720 align:middle line:90%
That is an extraordinary gift.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it goes
the other way, too.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're not minding
what's going on

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and if your epigenome is
showing-- it's reflecting

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that you've been eating trash
and that you're not exercising,

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.430 align:middle line:84%
you're not
meditating, not eating

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.660 align:middle line:84%
whole foods, and
the rest of it, that

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:90%
also is passed onto children.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're already
seeing in our studies

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:90%
what happens in both scenarios.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of voting for
the healthier scenario.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
children if we can.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:90%
DR. PEEKE: Of course.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk to parents.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And what advice could
you give the parents

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.880 align:middle line:90%
for a child that is obese?

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, they got that way by
eating these false fixes.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:84%
How do you recondition
the child's mind?

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.320 align:middle line:84%
You recondition the child's
mind by reconditioning

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the parent's mind.
LISA: I know.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but this
is a family affair.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.367 align:middle line:84%
You cannot leperize
a child and say,

00:51:55.367 --> 00:51:56.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, there's
something wrong with you.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
living in your home,

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're buying the groceries.
Now, wait a minute.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:90%
This is not a blame game.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.240 align:middle line:90%
This is a share game.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.635 align:middle line:84%
LISA: What about school?
What about pizza?

00:52:05.635 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:90%
What about--

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:06.730 align:middle line:84%
DR. PEEKE: No, but
it's everywhere.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:07.510 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:08.606 align:middle line:90%
It's in cafeterias.

00:52:08.606 --> 00:52:10.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's everywhere.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So that a parent may do
the best they can at home.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.450 align:middle line:84%
But then, the child
goes into an environment

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.001 align:middle line:84%
that's basically a war
zone, filled with land mines

00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:21.110 align:middle line:84%
everywhere.
LISA: Yes.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:84%
The best thing you could
possibly do is try to teach

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that child how to
be able to discern

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.130 align:middle line:90%
what's good and what isn't.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:31.827 align:middle line:84%
You know, kids can do this.
They're smart.

00:52:31.827 --> 00:52:32.760 align:middle line:90%
They're little smarty pants.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.950 align:middle line:90%
LISA: They know what's healthy.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.090 align:middle line:90%
And you know what you do?

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.430 align:middle line:84%
You get them involved
in growing gardens.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Kids decrease the
amount of trash

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:84%
they eat when they grow
their own garden because they

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.550 align:middle line:90%
make the connection.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.490 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:48.256 align:middle line:10%
And they have great pride
when they grew that, you know,

00:52:48.256 --> 00:52:48.955 align:middle line:10%
watermelon.

00:52:48.955 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And they are gonna
be able to eat it

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:90%
and share it with other people.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Get them involved with the
entire cooking process.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Get them involved
with food preparation,

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:84%
with food-- grocery
shopping, for instance.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.135 align:middle line:90%
Whole food preparation.

00:53:01.135 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Get it going.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Make them part of
the entire cycle.

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Right now, today's children
are so disassociated from all

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of that entire world of food
preparation, development,

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.890 align:middle line:90%
growing, the rest of it.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Bring them back in again.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
parents have to be engaged.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And if the parents
aren't engaged,

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the children will follow suit.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is
actually a great tip

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is to get the children
involved in growing food

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and in making the food
in the kitchen as well.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And when they get out
into the world-- I mean,

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a gluten free lifestyle
and so does my daughter.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.490 align:middle line:84%
When she gets to
school, it's sandwiches,

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:90%
pizza, breaded chicken.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that's--
DR. PEEKE: I know.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, so she has
to, at a young age,

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:90%
learn self discipline.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I don't want

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.914 align:middle line:90%
to give her a complex about it.

00:53:49.914 --> 00:53:51.479 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give her--
DR. PEEKE: No.

00:53:51.479 --> 00:53:54.081 align:middle line:84%
 --an eating disorder by
having her focus too much on it.

00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:54.780 align:middle line:90%
You know something?

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:59.231 align:middle line:84%
Your problem and your challenge
is shared by so many parents

00:53:59.231 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:84%
out there.
-Yes.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And my heart goes
out to all of you

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.160 align:middle line:84%
because this is so much
harder than when we grew up.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
When I grew up, I mean, my snack
after I came home from school

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:90%
were graham crackers and fruit.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.530 align:middle line:90%
It was sort of simple.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, it's like a whole
panoply of hyperpalatables.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And the poor kids don't
know which way is up.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And they think it's cool to
have the hyperpalatables.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.680 align:middle line:90%
We have to sit down.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to,
in a loving way,

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:84%
not in food policing at
all, but in a loving way,

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.700 align:middle line:84%
teach them by
mentoring ourselves,

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.320 align:middle line:84%
by being good role
models, and engaging them,

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
participating in
the entire thing.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, we're going
to be raising full generations

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of people, boys,
girls, men and women,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:90%
teens who are addicted to food.

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:50.050 align:middle line:90%
