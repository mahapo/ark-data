00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever struggled
with addiction,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the kind that gets
a hold of you,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you're in
maybe denial of the fact

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:90%
that it's gotten a hold of you?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just maybe
a social drinker

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that drinks maybe
seven nights a week?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to more and
more drinking or drug use?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, joining me is Tommy Rosen.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
He's an internationally
recognized yoga teacher

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and addiction and
recovery expert.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
He has spent the last
two decades immersed

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in yoga, recovery, and wellness,
which is very important.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He holds advanced certifications
in both hatha and kundalini

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
yoga, and he has more
than 23 years of recovery

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.172 align:middle line:90%
from acute drug addiction.

00:00:58.172 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad
you're here, Tommy,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
thank you for joining me.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TOMMY ROSEN: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It is great to be with you.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am so happy.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have combined these
two worlds of yoga and recovery

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.869 align:middle line:84%
Why did you put
those two together?

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I like to
say that necessity

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
is the mother of
invention, you know?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
In our world today, when people
move, say, through addiction,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.019 align:middle line:84%
and they're finding
out, I have a problem,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully they've reached
a point where they can actually

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
say, I have a problem, this
thing is bigger than me,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple of
directions that someone

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:90%
could take to get better.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the directions is
to enter a 12 step program.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Another direction
is to have some form

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of therapeutic process
going on, a one

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:90%
on one process with a therapist.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Different modalities.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Another is to enter
in-patient treatment,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:90%
or to have outpatient treatment.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And though all of those
systems are really

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
built to help you out
of chronic addiction,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to help you move from, OK,
I'm somebody that's stuck.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I have this issue, whether
that's drugs, alcohol, food,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.437 align:middle line:90%
sex, relationships, money--

00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gambling, whatever, yes.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Gambling,
the whole deal.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We'll help you to
move down a path where

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
you can get out of
chronic addiction.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Once you're out of
chronic addiction,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
now you have a foundation,
which is wonderful.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And a miracle has taken place.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:90%
You've gotten out of addiction.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But now, you're back to
facing all of the things

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
about yourself that
you may have turned

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to addictive behavior in
the first place to avoid.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see, I see, yes.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So now,
the question really

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
that happens for most of
us in recovery is now what?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You need a practice.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Some kind of practice
that brings the body into it.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
We learn-- most of us learn the
hard way-- I certainly learned

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the hard way-- that there is a
deeper level of detoxification

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
which is necessary in the
body to be completely at ease

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and to move forward in your life
and to be able to really start

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
to unravel the
traumas of your life.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Physical and
mental detoxification.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.047 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Absolutely.

00:03:05.047 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you back us up a
little bit into your story?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
How did you discover
in the first place

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that you were in that
place of serious addiction?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Originally,
well, it certainly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
wasn't hard to see,
for most people.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I came, as most people
do, I had this perspective

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:90%
that I know I'm in trouble.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, I even knew
I'm in trouble here.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'd always been
able to right the ship.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- the
basis of my denial

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
was I've always been able
to get through it before.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll figure out a way
to get through it again.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%
But that moment never came.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
would always maybe

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
get clean and sober
for a little while,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.488 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be OK
for a little while?

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: It wouldn't be
anything so clear as that.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It would be-- I'd be
partying for a run, taking

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of drugs and
alcohol, drinking,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
partying, the whole thing.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.595 align:middle line:84%
And then there'd be--
I'd realize, wow,

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:90%
this has got to stop.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd put it on
hold for a week.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Put it on hold for a couple
weeks, not get clean and sober,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.149 align:middle line:90%
nothing like that.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I see.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: This was
back originally.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally, what happened
for me is what

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
happens for a lot of people is I
reached what's called a bottom.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And I now know that
a bottom really

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.675 align:middle line:84%
is just the moment when you're
ready to tell the truth.

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's
just the beginning.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.738 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: It's just
that moment that

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
happens where you're like, OK.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:90%
This thing is bigger than me.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't go on living
like I'm living,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.207 align:middle line:84%
but I have no idea
how else to live.

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How to stop.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a stop.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.236 align:middle line:84%
It's an oh my god, I need to
stop, but I'm out of control

00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:41.026 align:middle line:90%
and don't know how.

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: That's right.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And you pray at that
moment that somebody

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.394 align:middle line:84%
is there to help guide
you towards some help.

00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was someone
there for you?

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.018 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: My family was there.

00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
My whole family was there.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank god they had
not abandoned me

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
through all of my
shenanigans all these years.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.456 align:middle line:84%
And they helped me
to get treatment.

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I went off to
Hazelton, which

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is a really wonderful treatment
center up in Minnesota.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And did you-- Now, you were
in your 20s at the time?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.656 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: I was 22.

00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And out of college?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Young man.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I was a senior in college
when I left to go to rehab.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So a ton of potential, but you
didn't-- so where do you think,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:90%
looking back now, that got lost?

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:90%
That potential got misdirected?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: And that's a
great question, Lisa,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
because what you'll hear about
most addicts and alcoholics is

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
people will tell them their
whole childhood, my god,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:90%
you have so much potential!

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:90%
You have so much potential!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.775 align:middle line:84%
How come you're not
realizing your potential?

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:42.066 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, when you're
doing drugs and alcohol,

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:43.115 align:middle line:90%
why don't you just stop?

00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you just stop?

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
That potential that so
many alcoholics and addicts

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
have hopefully gets realized
later on in recovery.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
For me, it began really
when I was 13 years old.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And the discomfort
of my childhood

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
coupled with an atrocious
diet and no sense

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
of how to sit still or to manage
stress, a lot of emotional pain

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
in my relationships at
home, a lot of struggles.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It all culminated in just
a level of discomfort

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that I was absolutely
unwilling to face.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So when I found,
actually, marijuana--

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
when I found marijuana,
it was at the time

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:90%
the greatest find of my life.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.662 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It relaxed you?

00:06:25.662 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: First
time, I felt like it

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
was the first deep breath I
had taken in my life ever.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: And it was Nancy
Reagan and Ronald Reagan,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
they were in power
in the United States.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And Nancy had her
Just Say No campaign.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't quite cover
the problem for me, you know?

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Just say no wasn't working.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.739 align:middle line:90%
So I just went down this road.

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you ever
hear that in recovery?

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Just say no!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Well, it's so absurd.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking up
to a homeless person.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.639 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you just get a home?

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: It's not taking the
full picture into account.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say, but
harder and harder to do.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you found recovery, and
then you got out of recovery,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
how did you find yoga?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: OK, so
my story is really

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
a story of recovery
within recovery.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, my first year
of recovery was 1991.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I went to rehab in '89.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I stayed sober for a year.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I relapsed for a whole year.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:84%
In, out, in, out, in, out, can't
stay sober, can't stay sober.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that
year, June 23, 1991,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
was the last time I
had a drug or a drink.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
That year, I was
in San Francisco.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.147 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big sign, yoga!

00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about yoga, and
I'd been interested in yoga,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:84%
but I'd certainly
never ventured--

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I literally walked off the
street into a yoga class.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The teacher's name
was Janet McCloud.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:90%
She's still a teacher today.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And I walked into her class.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.797 align:middle line:84%
And a couple things were
remarkable about this class

00:07:58.797 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
and about her.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Number one, she moved with
so much elegance and grace

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't believe it.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I literally thought I
was looking at a cartoon.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And she would bend or
get into a yoga pose.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And she'd move to
the point that you

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.577 align:middle line:84%
thought a normal human
being should move to.

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And then, she'd just keep going.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beyond?

00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: And I was like,
this doesn't look correct.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The feeling that I had was
she had so much freedom

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in her body, it was an
outward representation

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.532 align:middle line:84%
of what I had always
been looking for.

00:08:27.532 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd been looking for freedom.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.031 align:middle line:90%
I'd been looking for a way out.

00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
How do I transcend the
problems of my life?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
How do I move
beyond things that I

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to move beyond?

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
In her body, the way that she
moved, her elegance, her grace,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
it was that.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted it so badly.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had a
relationship with yoga

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
for the next-- I've had
a relationship with yoga

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:90%
since then.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But I had one kind
of relationship

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
with yoga through
the first 12 years

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
of my recovery, which was
very physically based.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't much about going
deeper or meditation.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It was just, let's
get a good workout.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a good sweat.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.927 align:middle line:90%
And let's breathe and move.

00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:08.635 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:09.776 align:middle line:90%
And that's wonderful.

00:09:09.776 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it started
to detoxify your body?

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Oh, no question,
I moved forward.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did you clean up
your diet at the same time?

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.202 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Not completely.

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It took a little while.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
My diet certainly
came a long way

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%
from where I was as a child.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which was?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I hadn't had a salad
until I was 18 years old.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I didn't
eat vegetables.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I ate processed
food of every kind--

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:90%
candy and Doritos and Coca-Cola.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I bounced through my
childhood from one sugar

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:90%
event to the next, basically.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:84%
All the meat that
I ate was-- came

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
from animals that basically
lived horrible lives

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and then were killed.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was organic.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was free range.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything was artificial.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I suffered around that diet.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I was sick so much as a child.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I set my body and my mind
up for a whopping case

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.575 align:middle line:90%
of drug addiction later on.

00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because of the
other chemicals in the food?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Oh, the
chemicals in the food,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but just also that
you're making yourself

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.314 align:middle line:90%
into a weaker human being.

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a point that I
like to talk to people about is

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that I really see that addiction
is a opportunistic disease.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe it will take
advantage of weakness.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So part of recovery for me,
and this is the key part,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
is you have to build yourself
into a strong person.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean just physically
strong, at every level.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.565 align:middle line:84%
So a weakened immune system
is a Petri dish for addiction.

00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:29.981 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Oh yeah,
for any disease.

00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Was there addiction
genetically in your family?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Or did that come
into play at all?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: The genetic
piece for me--

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:90%
so I can look back at my family.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
we've had a couple suicides

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
over the past three or
four generations, so

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:90%
certainly depression.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Certainly my mother
struggled with alcoholism.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather struggled.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There's elements in
there, not everybody,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
but there's elements
through there.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.062 align:middle line:84%
When I think about the
genetic question, genetics

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
most people are like, oh,
well I have these genetics.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:90%
What can I do about it?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Or I have a predisposition,
I better be very careful.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that the
science of epigenetics

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
is helping us understand that
our behavior, our attitude,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the people we hang out
with, the food that we eat,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
the environments
we put ourselves in

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
are going to actually have an
effect on our genetic readout.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It turns on all
those genetic markers, right?

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Or doesn't allow
the bad ones to turn on.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So if that addiction
marker is not turned on,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
you could have the
predisposition for alcoholism

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.700 align:middle line:90%
but never become an alcoholic.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So it begs the question,
what's involved?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: So environment.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you,
Lisa, do you think

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you would know how to
make-- how to nurture

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and how to create a
healthy human being?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who felt a sense
of esteem for themself?

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who felt good, who felt
confident, who felt healthy?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've had
to learn all that.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Right, we all have.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.872 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:10.872 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: But you
know how to do it.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.572 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing goes
for if I said to you, Lisa,

00:12:15.572 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take
this child, and we're

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:84%
going to make an addict
out of this child,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
you'd know exactly what to do.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Treat them inconsistently.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Make them feel bad
about themselves.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Give them a really,
really addictive diet

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:90%
based on a lot of sugar.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Make them feel insecure in who
they are and what they are.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, right when
they're coming of age,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.956 align:middle line:84%
introduce an
addictive substance.

00:12:39.956 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And boom, it's done.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like sugar,
like caffeine?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.169 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Like
marijuana, alcohol, sex.

00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, food.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Food.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.527 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, too much food,
and soothing emotions with food.

00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Absolutely.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's another huge--
it doesn't have to necessarily

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
be-- it could be a legal
substance, like food.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Anything that you use
to help yourself to feel better

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.279 align:middle line:84%
that causes-- creates
craving and ultimately brings

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
negative consequences

>>LISA: From the outside in.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
antidote to setting up

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
the body for addiction is
to develop the strength

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Absolutely,
along with connections,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
healthy connections
with other human beings.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:90%
It turns out we need these.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes!

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.661 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:31.530 align:middle line:90%
That's yes.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I know sometimes
I'm on the island.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.634 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:13:34.634 --> 00:13:36.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But sometimes, you
have to go to the island

00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to know where
the other people are.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.258 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Well,
there's a difference

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:43.442 align:middle line:90%
between solitude and loneliness.

00:13:43.442 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Or solitude
and isolation.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk about the mind.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
You have a great video here
that talks about the ego

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:90%
and how to eradicate the ego.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Ego eradicator.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ego eradicator.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.054 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to take
a look at this video.

00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:02.394 align:middle line:84%
Take a look with Tommy talking
about the ego eradicator.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:90%
-What's up, daily love posse?

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
This is Tommy Rosen.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And this week's vlog
is all about what

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
you can do when your mind
becomes a bad neighborhood.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Most everybody can relate
to this idea of waking up

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
on the wrong side of the bed,
feeling like your mind has

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
control of you rather
than the other way around.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I feel like most people
have that experience

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to get
control of our mind?

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you a
yoga exercise now called

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:90%
ego eradicator.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
It's three minutes in length.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
You can extend it to
any length you'd like,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:90%
but three minutes will do it.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
We'll do it together
and have this experience

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to gain
control over your mind

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to focus
yourself and align yourself

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.596 align:middle line:90%
with the day that's yet to come.

00:14:49.596 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.592 align:middle line:84%
In order to do
this exercise, you

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:90%
have to learn Breath of Fire.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a really simple breath.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll teach it to you right now.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The one caveat is, if you're
pregnant or menstruating,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:90%
please don't do Breath of Fire.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Do ego eradicator,
this exercise,

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
with long, deep
breathing instead.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, to do Breath of Fire,
we emphasize the exhale.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And the inhale is passive.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
When we exhale through
the nose rapidly,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
we pull our navel point in.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So the inhale, it just
happens automatically.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.565 align:middle line:84%
The exhale, however,
is emphasized;

00:15:36.565 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
we're really moving the
air through the nostrils

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
rapidly as we pull
the navel point in.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
add the arms to this.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So come up sitting
nice and tall.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Bring the arms up to 60 degrees.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Keep the arms
perfectly straight.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:90%
We'll close our eyes now.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to focus my eyes
right here in between the two

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
eyebrows.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep inhale.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And let's begin Breath of Fire.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.895 align:middle line:90%
So take a deep inhale.

00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Touch the thumbs together
over the head, and exhale.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And relax.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So we did that for about
30 seconds to a minute.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Imagine three minutes a day
when you wake up each morning.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It'll give you inner
calm, strength,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's a tool you can use
to get control of your mind

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:90%
before it gets control of you.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I wish that for you.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.072 align:middle line:90%
Have a great day.

00:17:02.072 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where did you
learn that breath exercise?

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:90%
That was very powerful.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: The ego
eradicator exercise

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.314 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
kundalini yoga tradition

00:17:13.314 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:90%
as taught by Yogi Bhajan.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:19.315 align:middle line:84%
So Yogi Bhajan brought that
one, and it brings together

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
a couple pretty
powerful element.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
So you're working
with Breath of Fire,

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
which is a very powerful
breath, very detoxifying, very

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
energizing, focusing, very
powerful breath, increases

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.465 align:middle line:84%
the lung capacity,
does a lot for you.

00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:84%
You're also working
with the arms

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
at a certain angle,
at 60 degrees.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're being asked
to keep your arms up

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
for a long period of time,
maybe three minutes or more.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in that
three minutes, your shoulders

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Burn.

00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:47.203 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: They're going to burn.

00:17:47.203 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
conversation going on.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And the shoulders--
the mind will pipe in,

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and the mind will say, you
know, please put your arms down.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
lower your arms?

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's quite enough now.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
No, seriously, put
your arms down.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation will
get more and more intense.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, you stay
committed to the exercise.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You're digging deeper than
the muscles of the body.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you need your muscles
to hold your arms up,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
but there's something
else going on.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:90%
What controls the muscles?

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually your
nervous system.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So the brain sends
an impulse down

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
through the central nervous
system, through the spine,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
spinal cord, goes out to the
peripheral nervous system.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And it causes you
to use your muscles

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to keep your arms
straight at 60 degrees.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The mind is presenting
a constant temptation.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The temptation is
lower the arms.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
actually doing is you

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
are facing a temptation, minute
to minute, breath by breath,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're resisting
the temptation.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.221 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Overriding.

00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Overriding, making
your nervous system stronger.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You're actually tuning
your nervous system

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.099 align:middle line:84%
to be able to resist
the temptation.

00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get
out into the world,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.754 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of temptations.

00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
talk about addictions,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
well, they're
everywhere all the time.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you're
trying to lose weight,

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and you struggle with
a chocolate cake.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.579 align:middle line:84%
You come across a deli
window, and lo and behold,

00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
there in the window is this
gorgeous piece of chocolate

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:90%
cake.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
having a bad day.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Having a rough day.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.503 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you just had a bad
conversation with someone

00:19:16.503 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:90%
you love or whatever it is.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And boy, that icing is
starting to look good.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And remember the first
time you had that cake?

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And your mind starts
going down that road.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're in that
realm of temptation.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you are either going
to resist the temptation

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to
pass and move on,

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or you'll succumb
to the temptation,

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have
the chocolate cake.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, just by practicing
strengthening your resolve

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
in the face of
temptation, represented

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
by keeping your arms
up when it's difficult,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
you are increasing
the likelihood

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to resist
the temptation later on out

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now how
does the kundalini

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:90%
come into play with that?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that is
specifically, if you could.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So the
kundalini energy is

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
thought to be the potential
energy of a human being which

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
exists and stays
locked, unaccessed,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%

right in the sacrum,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
right in the base of the spine.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And through these exercises,
we are tapping into

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and releasing that energy,
distributing it around the body

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become a fully
actualized and activated

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:90%

beautiful concept.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that's a bit
above someone else's head.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.663 align:middle line:84%

beautiful definition.

>>ROSEN: OK.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I would just simply
say to people,

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, we all
know somebody that

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:90%
is completely in their power.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see them, and you think,
my god, they're just on point.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They're just doing what
they're supposed to be doing.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It looks and it feels just
like they're right on mission.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:90%
They're activated.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, they've tapped
into that energy.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've practice
kundalini yoga.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it got
activated another way.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But they are-- they've dug
into their personal self,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
create from that place.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Amazing to be around them.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.796 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: These exercises
really help us.

00:21:17.796 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you've
been so off track

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to be caught in addiction,
to be able to come back home

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to the home office, which is the
heart, that is very powerful.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
These practices
really help with that.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.808 align:middle line:84%

a video here where

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
-People sometimes ask me,
why build a yoga and recovery

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
What is the benefit?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Why do this?

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell them is when
I turned 20 years sober,

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I went to pick up
my 20 year chip.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
The guy who handed me that
chip had, congratulations!

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:90%
You're 1 in 1,000.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself,
like, how grim is that?

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
999 people aren't
going to make it,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and one person makes it
to long term sobriety.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what he was
essentially saying.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my god,
there's a better way.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.015 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a way to
improve those odds for people

00:22:16.015 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
out there who are trying
to-- not just trying

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
to get into recovery, but
people who've been in recovery.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.987 align:middle line:90%
How do you stay on that path?

00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself one of
the most fortunate people

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I was able to find the
amazing program, the 12 steps,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and to overcome acute addiction.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
What I did not find were ways
that I could more effectively

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
live my life and get over
some of the other kinds

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of addictions that I
was still dealing with.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I still was living in
the energy of addiction

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:90%
even in my recovery.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
How do I get beyond
the energy of addiction

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to what I would
call true recovery?

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came for me
through the path of yoga.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Yoga helps you
build the capacity

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to move the issues
out of your tissues.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Stuck emotional energy
and trauma in the body

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:90%
keeps you stuck in the past.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Yoga moves those energies
through and liberates you

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:90%
so you can become fully present.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And all those years of
recovery, which were amazing,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and I was overcoming
acute drug addiction,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:90%
those were wonderful years.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
But I needed something more.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And I found it.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
There are practices
that exist that

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
will make your
recovery stronger,

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
that will stack the
odds more in your favor

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to stay on that path, that will
prevent relapse from happening,

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and that will help you to
build a fulfilling, sweet life.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
My recovery in the 12
steps took me to the point

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
where I overcame
acute addiction.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But I was still swimming
in the energy of addiction

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:90%
in other ways in my life.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was no longer
acceptable to me.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And the way the universe
made that clear to me was it

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:90%
took away my ability to move.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I developed a debilitating
back condition.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I could no longer
walk without pain.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It got worse and
worse and worse.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I tried everything I
could to get over it.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
More yoga, no yoga,
trainers, massage therapists,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
chiropractors, anything
I could get my hands on.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.582 align:middle line:90%
And I was still sick.

00:24:34.582 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel like
maybe this was it.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Like at 35 years old,
I was just not going

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to walk and
move freely anymore.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
frightening time for me.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So one day, a friend
comes to me and says,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
look, if you really
want to heal your back,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.292 align:middle line:84%
you need to go see this
guy named Guru Prem.

00:24:52.292 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
Guru Prem, Guru Prem.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not going
to go see some guru.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.662 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've been through
all these people.

00:24:59.662 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:90%
All these things.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying, trying everything.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not going to some guru.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I can see the
turban and the beard

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and the robes, the whole thing,
and it's just not for me.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So my friend says,
OK, that's fine.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.181 align:middle line:84%
Well, that night I went
out to dinner with my wife.

00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman at
the table next to ours.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And we struck up a conversation.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
She had just moved
to Los Angeles.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And we asked why,
what brings you here?

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, I came
here really to see

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:90%
this man named Guru Prem.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So you see, my life has been
a series of second chances

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Despite myself, I got
the pretty clear message

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to see
this guy named Guru Prem.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I called him the next morning
and I said, apparently,

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm supposed to come see you.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
better get in here then.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
For the next five years, I
sat opposite him once a week.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:90%
He taught me how to breathe.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
He taught me how to move.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
He taught me how to
interact with people.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
He taught me about
relationships with women.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a parameter
for living my life

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
in a way that made sense to me.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, he gave
me things to aspire to.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And he taught me kundalini yoga.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And in three months, I
was able to heal my back.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I had been told
by the top doctors

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
here that it was manage your
pain for the rest of your life,

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and eventually we'll
look to surgery.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And thank god that was not the
fate that ended up unfolding

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%

of kundalini yoga

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%

He taught me how
to breathe first.

He taught me how to move.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
He taught me kundalini yoga,
how to tap into my true self,

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:90%
how to live from that place.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%

>>ROSEN: Super physical.

And this is not to say that
kundalini yoga is not physical.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's very physical.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But its emphasis is more on
nervous system strengthening

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and on endocrine
system rebalancing.

all of these things, sure.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It also gives you this
feeling of immense bliss

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:90%
in the practice.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I talk to people about
the infinite pharmacy within.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So inside of us, we have
an infinite pharmacy.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this should be of
particular note and of interest

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.679 align:middle line:84%
to people who've struggled
with drug addiction before.

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: What are
we looking for?

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for a feeling
of well being, a feeling

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness at
any given moment.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just so happens that
our endocrine system, which

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
is our chemical system, I call
that the infinite pharmacy

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
within, if you know how to work
with that and tap into that,

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
you can get your endocrine
system to distribute

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:84%
the right drugs in the
right amounts to the right

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:90%
places at the right time.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: And that's just
called feeling well.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where the
serotonin releases

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
at the right time, and the
neurochemicals all balance out,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:90%
and nothing's overdone.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all in balance.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Yeah.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.468 align:middle line:84%
To you or me it just
looks like someone's

00:28:33.468 --> 00:28:34.589 align:middle line:90%
smiling and comfortable.

00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And they're enjoying their day.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: That's
just the right drug.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you mentally can
tap into that and rise that out

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Physically
and mentally.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
There's very specific
protocols for doing that.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But you understand
that we've been

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to reach
outside of ourselves

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
for drugs, alcohol, food,
whatever it is to feel better.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We're tinkering with the
natural system within.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could you teach
us a little bit of that?

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Sure.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would be awesome.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between regular yoga

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
about to teach here?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Yeah, this
is just a form.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.936 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: It's just
a form of yoga.

00:29:13.936 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's all yoga.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:90%
It's all yoga.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of yoga, to calm
the fluctuations of the mind.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would
love to learn how

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:90%
to-- what you're about to teach.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And what is this?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.474 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Ego eradicator,
we'll do that, as well.

00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll tap into the endocrine
system, help you feel better.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:90%
But this is really super simple.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.692 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll
teach is-- you want

00:29:33.692 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to have your feet flat
on the floor if you can,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting
up nice and tall.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.984 align:middle line:84%
And you're bringing each
finger tip together.

00:29:38.984 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Are we starting now?

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: OK.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So just bring each
finger tip together,

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.226 align:middle line:84%
just like you're making a
little tent with your hands.

00:29:46.226 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And the fingers will
point straight up.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And you'll keep that just right
in front of the heart center.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:90%
And relax the shoulders.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And just feel like
you're flowing.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And you'll close the eyes.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And just leave a slit, just
a slit in the eyes open.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:90%
So you're not completely closed.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:90%
You know you're here.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And through the
slit in your eyes,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:90%
you can see the fingertips.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
You're not particularly
focused on anything,

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:84%
but you just know
that you're here.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do
a breath rhythm now.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have you
inhale for five seconds.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you
hold for five seconds.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you
exhale for five seconds.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to count you
through a few rounds of that.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, you and
I will go silent.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue our
count of inhaling for five,

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
pausing for five, and
exhaling for five.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll just go like that.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about what it
is, what's happening, afterward.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes are open just a
slit, sitting up nice and tall.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And begin to inhale for
one, two, three, four, five.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Pause your breath,
two, three, four, five.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, five, four,
three, two, one.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, one, two,
three, four, five.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Pause your breath,
two, three, four, five.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, four, three, two, one.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, two, three, four, five.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Pause your breath,
three, four, five.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, Four, three, two, one.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, continue
on your own count.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:47.083 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling five, pausing for
five, exhaling for five.

00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:48.666 align:middle line:84%
We'll be here for
just about a minute.

00:31:48.666 --> 00:32:19.672 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.672 --> 00:32:21.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It begins
to feel like a wave.

00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:28.188 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.188 --> 00:32:29.188 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: One more round.

00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.953 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: And exhale.

00:32:39.953 --> 00:32:42.075 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.075 --> 00:32:43.305 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:43.305 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So then, just turn your palms
face up and close your eyes

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:90%
all the way.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.047 align:middle line:84%
And just notice how
you feel inside.

00:32:49.047 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.177 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.177 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Allow your breathing
to return to normal.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I feel incredibly
alive and connected.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.871 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: That's nice!

00:33:01.871 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:90%
That's nice.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.812 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And calm.

00:33:03.812 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: And come
with the eyes open.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.345 align:middle line:84%
So that's called the meditation
to clear past emotion

00:33:09.345 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:90%
and for stress relief.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.356 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on there?

00:33:13.356 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand--
so this is called

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
a mudra, whatever we
do with our hands.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is a mudra, this
is a different mudra,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.180 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of different mudras.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
When we do something with our
hands to seal the energy here,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.015 align:middle line:90%
that's called a mudra.

00:33:28.015 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So what I ask people to do is
to envision a fetus in the womb.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
As we're in fetal position,
before we develop,

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:90%
our hands and our brain are one.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Our hands haven't yet
come apart from our brain.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.447 align:middle line:84%
And as the fetus develops, of
course, our hands and our arms

00:33:44.447 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:90%
come apart from our brain.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a deep,
deep connection

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
between your fingertips
and your brain.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's reasons
why yogis do things.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
There's always
science behind it.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we bring these
fingertips together like this,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.909 align:middle line:84%
we're creating a balanced
center between the two

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:01.950 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres of the brain.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
This is creating a
sense of balance.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's a real sense
of, OK, here's my center.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people who struggle
with addiction-- actually,

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
most people in the world
don't breathe very well.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or have that
connection with themselves.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So as you-- addiction
is really a sense of lack.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:90%
So something's missing.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing in our
body is our breath, of course.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You can live without
food for a long time.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:84%
You can live without water
for at least a few days.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But to go without your breath
for even a few minutes, that's

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.270 align:middle line:90%
a real problem for us, you know?

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So the breath is the
highest, most important need

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.340 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing here
is we are creating a rhythm,

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're sending a very
deep, psychological signal

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Your core need is being met.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So that sense of
lack that an addict

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:84%
might feel, if you're
going to breathe shallowly,

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:84%
which most addicts do, you're
reinforcing with every breath

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.919 align:middle line:90%
a sense of lack.

00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense?

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it does, it does.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You have a really
wonderful point

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:84%
here where you talk about
addiction and society

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.544 align:middle line:84%
and how our society sets us up
for addiction in certain ways.

00:35:21.544 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at this video.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It's really a wonderful point.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.188 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:28.188 --> 00:35:30.172 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:30.172 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:46.870 align:middle line:84%
-In 1935, the founder
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Bill Wilson, had a
spiritual awakening.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Literally a white
light experience--

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
he was in a hospital being
treated for alcoholism

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
for the third or fourth
time in his life.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
He had no inkling of
ever being able to get

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.977 align:middle line:90%
beyond that problem.

00:36:00.977 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But there he was,
in his hospital room

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
at night, and boom, there was
this divine, spiritual moment

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And the centerpiece of the
download that came into him

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
was this idea that
one person who's

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
struggling with the
disease of alcoholism

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
has to help another
person in order for them

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
both to be healed.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And that that next
person would have

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to help people in order
for them to be healed.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The core of the enlightenment
that he experienced

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:90%
was altruism.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I have to give it away if I
want to heal and keep it myself.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:84%
That is a beautiful,
amazing doctrine.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And it has lived on
through the past 80 years.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And it has saved the lives of
literally millions of people.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Families have come
back together.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Pain and suffering
have been alleviated.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:90%
You look at the doctrine.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:90%
The doctrine is the 12 steps.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real
purity in there,

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
as there are in many doctrines,
many spiritual paths, right?

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But one of the challenges
about doctrines

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is that we build a structure
around the doctrine.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Those can be churches
or synagogues or mosques

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:90%
or holy places.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Or it can just be a
congregation of people

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
who congregate
around the doctrine.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And we congregate
around the doctrine

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:90%
to protect the doctrine.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, and
almost inevitably, the day

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:84%
comes where we have to
rescue the teaching back

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:84%
from the congregation, back
from the structure we built

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
around the doctrine to
protect the doctrine

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.759 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:37:57.759 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're
living in that time

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
right now when it
comes to the 12 steps.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
about addiction--

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
disease that affects

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:90%
everyone in our society.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:84%
If you are not a marijuana
addict, an alcoholic, a cocaine

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:84%
addict, a pill addict; if
you are not a food addict,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
if you are not a sex
addict, if you're not a porn

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
addict, if you are not
struggling with money,

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
gambling, over-shopping,
if you are not spending way

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:84%
too much time on technology;
if that's not you,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:84%
then you know somebody and
love somebody who's struggling.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, everyone
in our society

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:84%
is touched by this
massive problem.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, 80 years after this
man had his spiritual awakening

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and realized that all it
took was one person who

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.110 align:middle line:84%
has the affliction of alcoholism
to help another person-- 80

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
years later, we're still
living in a society

00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
where people feel the need
to be secretive, to be quiet.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.060 align:middle line:84%
We're still,
metaphorically speaking,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:90%
in the church basement.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:90%
12 step meetings are down there.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:84%
When is the conversation
going to come up

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:90%
into the light of day?

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We have a society that treats
addicts like they're criminals.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand that
addiction comes from trauma,

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that we are criminalizing
traumatized people.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Our prison population
is the biggest

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:90%
in the world per capita.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:84%
We take more drugs per
capita than any other country

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
We spend more money on medical
problems related to alcoholism

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.756 align:middle line:84%
and drug addiction than any
other country in the world.

00:39:42.756 --> 00:39:43.431 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:43.431 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You set out a
very important point there

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
about that we are criminalizing
traumatized people.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
in prison have

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.344 align:middle line:84%
had some type of deep trauma in
their past, like 99% of them,

00:39:56.344 --> 00:39:58.500 align:middle line:90%
or a very, very high percent.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do
instead of putting

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.580 align:middle line:84%
people who have had deep,
unresolved trauma in prison?

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Well, this
is just a huge point.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: We have the
largest prison population

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in the world in
the United States.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you took the entire
prison population of the world,

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
the United States
represents 25% of it.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So that means that
one in four people in prison

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
in the world happen to be
from the land of the free.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an interesting
way of putting it.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: There's an
unfortunate irony there.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But the people
that are in prison

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
are-- the non-violent
offenders, so many of them

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.110 align:middle line:84%
are people who struggle
with addiction, alcoholism.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.800 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I'll just
say one more statistic.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol is related in
40% of violent crime.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol has a part in
40% of violent crime.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to
talk about how to change,

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.420 align:middle line:84%
how to treat people
who are traumatized,

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:84%
certainly we can't treat them
by traumatizing them further.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be a
protocol that would

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.280 align:middle line:90%
help them or help society.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the addiction--
I mean, the trauma

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:84%
sets off the
addiction that leads

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to the alcohol or the
drug abuse that then leads

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to the criminal
act, that then goes

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:84%
right back into the system
of more trauma in the prison

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:25.710 align:middle line:90%
system, right?

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Yes.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.945 align:middle line:84%
One of my mentors and
someone I really admire a lot

00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:90%
is Dr. Gabor Mate.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He writes a lot about
addiction and speaks--

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:84%
he's an exceptional
speaker and presenter.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:84%
He talks a lot about this
idea of all addiction coming

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:84%
from trauma, all addiction
coming from trauma.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take a
traumatized person and you're

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.780 align:middle line:84%
going to chase them and
persecute them and put them

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
behind bars with a bunch of
other traumatized people, some

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of whom are very
violent, we know

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
this is not leading in
the correct direction.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to take-- if you

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
want to punish a
traumatized person,

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you first ask
yourself, in so doing,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is that going to be for
the betterment of society?

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to be for the
common good of everybody?

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.314 align:middle line:84%
It's not for the
common good of anybody.

00:42:14.314 --> 00:42:16.355 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get out of
the punishment mentality

00:42:16.355 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:90%
and realize, OK.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.582 align:middle line:90%
This is a sick person.

00:42:19.582 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a person
who's traumatized.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So how do we treat them?

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.779 align:middle line:84%
Well, we treat them
with treatment.

00:42:24.779 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So there's primary
treatment for addiction.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:84%
There's all manner of
trauma-related modalities

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:90%
of recovering from trauma.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There's so much we're
learning about PTSD right now

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
with our military,
but also people

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:84%
who have come out of really
rough childhoods have PTSD.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:84%
We actually know a lot about
treating that condition.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Half of these
people are dyslexic.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:90%
You've got conditions like ADD.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.230 align:middle line:84%
You have a population of people
who feel like they're separate,

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
who feel like they're alone,
who don't feel supported,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
who feel like they're not
going to have their needs met

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
in the world, so they have
to go out and take it.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Or numb it.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to do is we have to--

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.729 align:middle line:84%
in the most plain terms, we have
to connect with these people.

00:43:16.729 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to not treat them
like they're less than.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to treat them
like they need something,

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and to help work
with them to get them

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.690 align:middle line:84%
what they need so that they can
become a healthier individual.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, a productive
member of society.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, a content
and vibrant human being.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you think that
12 step programs, treatment

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:84%
centers, recovery centers, and
yoga are the way to do that?

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Absolutely.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Certainly a better step, a
better place to go for sure.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's the ultimate?

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Well, the ultimate
is to have a program that's

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:58.010 align:middle line:84%
based upon love,
kindness, compassion,

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that brings together
modalities of healing

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.430 align:middle line:90%
such as yoga, meditation.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So ashrams
would be the new prison.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I think so,
without question.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.006 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: If you could create
a community of people that--

00:44:11.006 --> 00:44:12.380 align:middle line:84%
now understand,
we're not talking

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:16.290 align:middle line:84%
about violent,
pathological criminals.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to fit
within this particular view.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There's different
problems there that

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
need to be treated
in some kind of way.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.030 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't find a male
in the United States

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't at
some point thought

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of the horror of
being raped in prison.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about-- I'm
not too close to prison,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:84%
but there's many times in my
past I could have gone there.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, and
I thank god every day,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.831 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to go there.

00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's no one
alive today who's

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.320 align:middle line:84%
my age who doesn't
think about that.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We've seen too
many images on TV.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
We've seen-- we've
heard the stories.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what our solution is
for people who are criminals?

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put them into a--
basically a hotbed of addiction

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:90%
with other criminals?

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.560 align:middle line:84%
How can that be the solution
of a merciful society?

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, in
the case of recovery

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:84%

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:84%
here, when somebody
goes into a place,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and to avoid all of that, and
avoid going into a prison,

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:84%
someone needs to stay in a place
of their right mind, right?

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So they need to stay
in a place of recovery.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:90%

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:27.715 align:middle line:90%

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
do that to avoid all
that we just talked about

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:90%
with the prisons?

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.760 align:middle line:84%
How do you avoid that and stay
on that one day at a time?

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:90%
How do you stay there?

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.393 align:middle line:84%

00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:47.700 align:middle line:84%

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.490 align:middle line:90%

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.090 align:middle line:84%
what I teach in the

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:02.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest,
most powerful, spiritual,

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and logistically correct
approaches to life

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is the one day at

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Start to bring it
down into a day.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're craving
drugs and alcohol,

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.200 align:middle line:84%
you're craving whatever it is
that's your drug of choice,

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know how you're
going to get through it,

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and will this ever
pass, all you need to do

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.820 align:middle line:90%
is get to bed without using.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Just go to sleep at night
not having used that day.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's a successful day.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Later on, one day at

of that ability

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to sit still, to cultivate a
relationship with oneself is,

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to me, the antidote to addiction
and the antidote to crime.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:84%

far as I can tell,

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.710 align:middle line:84%
we haven't really been
teaching that in prison much.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.320 align:middle line:84%

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Is success a metric?

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.892 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I stayed sober for a year.

00:48:21.892 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Nevermind the fact that I
was miserable for the year,

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:24.960 align:middle line:90%
but I stayed sober.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.670 align:middle line:90%

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.620 align:middle line:90%
No!

That's not a success to me.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:84%

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So that a person
who used to think

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.540 align:middle line:84%
about drugs and alcohol or
some other addictive behavior

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:45.450 align:middle line:84%

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:52.474 align:middle line:84%
of family and community,
maybe about manifesting dreams

00:48:52.474 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:84%

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.230 align:middle line:84%
If we don't come out
and tell our story,

00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:00.330 align:middle line:84%
if we don't share with the
world what a success looks like,

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.600 align:middle line:84%
why would anybody except a
desperate person, broken down,

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:84%
ever want to be attracted
into a 12 step room?

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it a party going on in there?

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, it is a
party going on in there,

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:19.940 align:middle line:84%
but you wouldn't know it because
unless you're a desperate, fall

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
down drunk, I had
nowhere else to turn,

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:84%
so I turned to the 12 steps--
unless you were that desperate,

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.190 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't end up there.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Unless a court sent you there,
you wouldn't end up there.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Unless your family left you,
you wouldn't end up there.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know what
a success looks like that's

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.380 align:middle line:90%
come out of those rooms.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:44.210 align:middle line:84%
People get on my case from 12
step programs all the time.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And don't get me wrong.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I love the 12 steps.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.490 align:middle line:90%
They saved my life.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.489 align:middle line:90%
And I love most of its members.

00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people who
follow that path, I really

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.250 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the idea that these
people are going to live along

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual path,
work at being honest,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.320 align:middle line:90%
try to clean up their mistakes.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I love all those things.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful,
wonderful program.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.379 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people give
me crap, though.

00:51:05.379 --> 00:51:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
you're not supposed

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to go out and speak
about these things!

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to go out
and represent a fellowship.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just tell them what
I tell you right now.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not representing
a fellowship.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not representing
any fellowship.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a member
of a fellowship.

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm a human being, and I walk
the path of the 12 steps.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And it saved my life from
acute drug addiction.

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And the path of
yoga and meditation

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and healthy, conscious
lifestyle choices

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:90%
took me the rest of the way.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do in my life
just what that guy who

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.450 align:middle line:84%
had that spiritual
awakening back in 1935,

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:90%
just what he figured out.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I pass it on to
another human being.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But I don't do it
from within the guise

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of I'm a broken person,
or I'm still an addict,

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.540 align:middle line:90%
or I'm still suffering.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.040 align:middle line:90%
No, no no.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I just do it as a human being.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.230 align:middle line:90%
That means I have joy.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I have challenges.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I suffer and grieve.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I get better and well.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I have fun.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a complete and
full and wonderful life.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.387 align:middle line:84%
And from that place,
I'm truly able to help

00:52:10.387 --> 00:52:11.220 align:middle line:90%
another human being.

>>LISA: So you don't
agree with that language

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of once an addict, I am an
addict languaging, do you?

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: No, that's
problematic for me as a yogi

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and as a human being.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we-- I want
to be very clear here.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I love the 12 step program, very
helpful to me, saved my life.

>>LISA: Totally.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: So this is not
bashing that society

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.780 align:middle line:90%
or bashing that program.

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.654 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please, yeah.

00:52:39.654 --> 00:52:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: It's simply saying
that the 12 steps are

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.490 align:middle line:84%
too effective to overlook, but
they're not effective enough

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to say that they're perfect
and beyond improvement.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
That the way people
approach them

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.720 align:middle line:84%
in this society that's around
them should be always looking

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how can
it do things better?

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the off-putting
things about that society,

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, to many people
that I've spoken with

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't
understand why-- so I'm

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.270 align:middle line:90%
23 years sober, right?

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had a drink
or a drug for 23 years.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You would think, as
a casual onlooker,

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.920 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, you
must be better now.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.850 align:middle line:90%
You must be cured.

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.476 align:middle line:84%
But if I raise my
hand in front of you,

00:53:19.476 --> 00:53:20.516 align:middle line:90%
and you don't understand.

00:53:20.516 --> 00:53:22.155 align:middle line:84%
I say, my name is
Tommy, I'm an addict.

00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, I
don't understand.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.875 align:middle line:84%
When do you get better
from this thing?

00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:27.458 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So what would you raise
your hand and say instead?

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:30.950 align:middle line:90%
My name is Tommy--

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I'm in
recovery from addiction.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm a person in
long term recovery.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Or I have experienced addiction.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Or I've recovered from drug
addiction and alcoholism.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or I moved beyond.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: I've moved
beyond addiction.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.870 align:middle line:84%
That would really
raise some feathers.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That would really
raise some feathers.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:51.298 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Would it?

00:53:51.298 --> 00:53:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: Oh, that would be
a revolutionary statement.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I've moved beyond addiction.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:55.860 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Because most people in the field
don't believe that's possible.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm interested in
in your question earlier was,

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.940 align:middle line:90%
how should we treat addicts?

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We should treat
them with treatment.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.870 align:middle line:84%
We should treat them
with compassionate means

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to help them get better
from a disease recognized

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.970 align:middle line:84%
by the American Medical
Association that

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.600 align:middle line:90%
has a treatment.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.360 align:middle line:84%
If you apply the
treatment, you get better.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Once you get better,
you need to start

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.590 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
bringing lifestyle

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.040 align:middle line:84%
elements into your life that
are going to make your body

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and your mind work really well.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Keep moving forward
in your life.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, that I'm
Tommy and I'm an addict,

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.860 align:middle line:90%
it has to change.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I truly believe we're
moving beyond addiction.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
think it's possible,

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to try
to go beyond addiction.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Someone would have to
tell you it's possible.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:90%
It's hard, but try.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe it's the
first five years, two years

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:90%

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:90%
You say that.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:00.060 align:middle line:84%

marker, I've moved beyond--

times for different people.

>>LISA: I see.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSEN: People say, well,
now you're recovered.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you can go out
and drink and it's no problem?

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It means I have no desire to do
something that would intoxicate

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.029 align:middle line:90%

00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:16.820 align:middle line:90%

in resistance to it.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.413 align:middle line:84%
You just don't have
any desire for it.

00:55:20.413 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSEN: Why would I do that?

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
greater awareness,

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.660 align:middle line:90%
greater consciousness.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.969 align:middle line:90%

here where Tommy's

00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:31.790 align:middle line:90%
talking about moving beyond.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.650 align:middle line:84%
-So I guess the whole point
of this is just simply to say,

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:39.550 align:middle line:84%
if we're really going to
move forward as a society,

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:42.050 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to start
to understand what works about

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:45.330 align:middle line:90%
the 12 steps and what doesn't.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We can't throw it out as if it's
the baby with the bath water.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The 12 steps, there's such
magic and such power in there.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is it's
not a perfect program.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It's too effective
to be overlooked,

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.565 align:middle line:84%
but it's not effective enough
to be beyond improvement.

00:56:05.565 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to
take a deep look at that.

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
to look at our policy.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we treat
addicts in our world?

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Do we send them to prison?

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a school for
becoming an addict, right?

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to help
them get treatment?

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
room for improvement.

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But we really have to
come together right now,

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.184 align:middle line:84%
and we have to take a holistic
approach to this thing.

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
addiction goes way

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.800 align:middle line:90%
beyond just drugs and alcohol.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And in our treatment
approaches, we

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.040 align:middle line:84%
have to understand that
things like learning

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.800 align:middle line:84%
how to breathe properly, like
in the yogic style of breathing

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and meditation, are going
to be very important.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.490 align:middle line:84%
That treating our body
well, and actually

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.666 align:middle line:84%
learning how to manage stress,
that's going to be important.

00:56:46.666 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
learn that food is not

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.050 align:middle line:90%
an outside issue.

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Food is an inside issue.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't take a look
at our relationship to food,

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.558 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
something seriously missing

00:56:56.558 --> 00:56:58.304 align:middle line:90%
from our path of recovery.

00:56:58.304 --> 00:56:59.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to learn that things

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.640 align:middle line:84%
like vocational
training, life coaching,

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and actually learning what
our mission and our purpose

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.830 align:middle line:84%
is on this planet, those
are important things.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we bring those
things into recovery

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.210 align:middle line:84%
at the right stage
when a person is ready,

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:15.936 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of that person
going back and relapsing

00:57:15.936 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
greatly decreased.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.450 align:middle line:84%
These are the tenets
of recovery 2.0.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm passionate
about this movement.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm passionate
about the 12 steps.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I see the doctrine as
this golden, beautiful thing

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that it was when it was created,
and it's still the same way

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:35.870 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And all I wish for is that
everybody who would seek

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.270 align:middle line:84%
would have access to that
doctrine without fearing

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that there was a cult or
religion or all the weirdness

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.890 align:middle line:90%
or any barrier to entry to it.

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand
these steps work.

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:90%
They treat addiction.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.331 align:middle line:90%
There is a way through.

00:57:54.331 --> 00:57:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to be stuck
for the rest of your life.

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
beyond acute addiction,

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:02.170 align:middle line:84%
you can add other
elements into your life

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.709 align:middle line:84%
to live the life of
your dreams and beyond.

00:58:05.709 --> 00:58:06.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the message.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.200 align:middle line:84%
My name's Tommy, and
I am not an addict.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm a human being on
the path of recovery.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a success story today.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell me
your success story.

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Use #movebeyond and tell me
what a success looks like to you

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.840 align:middle line:90%
on your path of recovery.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

>>LISA: I love that you get
people involved and interactive

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.290 align:middle line:84%
so that they can also hashtag
you and talk about how they can

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:39.220 align:middle line:84%
move beyond because
you are creating

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.840 align:middle line:84%
