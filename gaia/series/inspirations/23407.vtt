00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, and
welcome to "Inspirations."

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm your guest
host, Jay Weidner,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:84%
coming from the beautiful Gaiam
studios in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Lisa Garr will be back
in this seat next week,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:90%
talking to Bruce Lipton.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That should be a great show.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.145 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of great shows,
we have one today.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:36.245 align:middle line:84%
We have a very special guest
on "Inspirations," Richard C.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Hoglan.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Richard is a former adviser to
CBS News and Walter Cronkite.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
He has also served as
a consultant to NASA.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
He's written two books,
"The Monuments of Mars"

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and New York Times
bestseller "Dark Mission:

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
The Secret History of NASA."

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Richard is also the head
of the Enterprise Mission,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%
at enterprisemission.com.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Today, Richard and I are
going to be discussing

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
the multiple eclipses that
are occurring this year, 2012.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:84%
The first eclipse is coming up
in just a few days, on May 20.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
That will be the annular
eclipse of the sun.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
The second eclipse is the
Venus transit in early June.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And the third eclipse
is the granddaddy

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
of them all, the eclipse of the
sun in the center of the Milky

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Way galaxy on the solstice,
December 21, 2012.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Richard has an unusual
take on eclipses

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.282 align:middle line:84%
and what happens during
the course of one.

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would
have him on to explain

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:90%
this unique perspective.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I also think it
serves as a useful segue

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
into understanding another
kind of physics, a physics that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
explains the
geological events that

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:90%
are occurring all around us.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.435 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. HOAGLAND:
It's great being here.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: We've only got an hour.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:90%
We've got a lot to cover.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's start at the beginning.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
What's all this
business about eclipses?

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: You know, if you'd
asked me that 10 years ago, I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have been able
to give you an answer.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I now know that, even
in cultural things,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
like films-- like, for
instance, "Forbidden Planet."

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember that scene
where the first officer

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
says to the captain, "This ship
even makes its own eclipses?"

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Or our favorite, Stanley
Kubrick-- the opening of "2001"

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.512 align:middle line:84%
was the secret of why
eclipses are crucial.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to talk

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
about in the next hour,
because we have figured

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
out the physics of
eclipses, of alignments.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing less
and nothing more

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
than the basis for why
astrology actually is a science.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So let's start
at the beginning

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:90%
of this eclipse thing.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's Maurice Allais?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Allais was the guy--
he was a French genius-- who

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.535 align:middle line:84%
actually always wanted
to be a physicist.

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And his mommy told him
he had to do something

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that would be
economically reasonable.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.245 align:middle line:84%
So he became an
economist, and in 1988, he

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%
won a Nobel Prize for economics.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But he kept an
exquisite track record

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
with the French
Academy of Sciences,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
published paper after
paper in physics,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and began experimenting in
the '50s with pendulums,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
except not those long
Foucault pendulums

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
you see in museums with the very
long wire and the long swing

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:84%
He invented something called
a periconical pendulum, which

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
is probably from the ceiling
here maybe to the top

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
your head, which has
a much faster period.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to,
using this pendulum,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
chart all kinds of unseen
stresses and strains, what

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
he called the
anisotropy of space,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
kind of medium,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:90%
some kind of matrix-- the ether.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And in 1954, using
this gadget that you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
can see on screen, which is an
actual shot in his laboratory,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
which was underground
in a basement, sealed

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
off, no temperature variations,
no air currents and all that,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
he would do
month-long experiments

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
with these pendulums, looking
at periods and alignments

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Well-- this is one of his
lab technicians-- in 1954,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
there happened to be a partial
eclipse of the sun over Paris.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.805 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't total.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%
It was partial.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:84%
He was doing something
else, probably

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
sleeping, because they
had to do 24-hour shifts

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind of
data collection.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
His chief laboratory
scientist, the head of his lab,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
was doing the experiments
with the pendulum

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and found, during this
eclipse, a stunning phenomenon,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
an anomalous phenomenon
with the pendulum

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
where, as the moon moved
across the sun, the pendulum,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
instead of continuing to
progress in an azimuth,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
meaning it would walk its way
around a circle, it suddenly--

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is a schematic
of his actual diagram

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of the experiment-- it
began to go backwards.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It began to literally change
by 13 and 1/2 degrees,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the
period of an hour

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
as the eclipse approached the
maximum amount there in Paris.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And then it reversed its trend.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a graph showing
the trend curve, which

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is the red line sloping
down to the right.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Then you can see the
three green lines.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning,
the middle,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the eclipse,
as seen from Paris.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
All the action was in the
first half of the eclipse,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:90%
up until the midpoint.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
These are data that he
was able to collect,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
superimposed on each other,
from a second eclipse in 1959.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, science
is nothing but replication.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If you see something
once, it could

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
be an anomaly, it could be just
a weird accident, coincidence,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You see it more
than once-- well,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Allais saw the same bizarre
pendulum behavior twice

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
at an eclipse that
crossed over Paris.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Now this is called
the Allais effect.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And it leads us into this
extraordinary, almost sci-fi

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
world of a parallel science
that has been suppressed,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
which we call hyperdimensional
physics, which is basically

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
the way the universe
really runs,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
that, for the last several
years, the folks in charge

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
have apparently not
wanted us to know about.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.759 align:middle line:84%
And it's these
democratized experiments,

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
including what we're going
to be doing in this upcoming

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
eclipse, that we think
are going to finally blow

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the doors off the way
things really work.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what is this
hyperdimensional torsion field

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:90%
physics?

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well,
our model, buttressed

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
by Allais's experimental
data, space is not empty.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:90%
There is a matrix.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
There is an ether.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And rotating objects
interact with each other

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
through, you could call it, the
Einstein space-time continuum.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:90%
It has a lot of different names.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.875 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the stuff
between atoms, between matter

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, if matter is
organized so that it rotates,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
it generates waves
in this matrix that

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
communicate to other
rotating bodies in excess

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:90%
of the speed of light.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
Einstein and Carton

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and some equations
they put together back

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in 1913 that turned out to
be partially right and mostly

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
wrong, because the Carton
version of relativity

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
for torsion fields was
that they were static,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't move,
and they were so tiny

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that they would be undetectable
at the normal, everyday

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:90%
laboratory level.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Years later,
physicists discovered

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, these waves
are much more powerful,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
something like 22
orders of magnitude.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:90%
That's 1 followed by 21 zeros.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So they can have
real-world effects.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like Allais was
the first modern physicist

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%
to discover them.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we did separately,
not knowing of Allais's work,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.802 align:middle line:84%
we worked on the theory
of rotating planets.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And on the screen
there, you'll see

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics from,
basically, the--

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Jupiter.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND:
--Jupiter on the left

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and the circumscribed double
tetrahedra on the right.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
The physics, as we
have figured it out,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:84%
tends to show these
geometric alignments

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of rotating
bodies, like planets and stars.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have solar events,
you have geophysical events,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
you have volcanoes or the
Great Red Spot on Jupiter,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
coming up in accordance
with this geometry, which

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is a signature that,
at the unseen level,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
at the realm of
the level of space,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
these rotating objects are
communicating to other rotating

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.150 align:middle line:84%
objects, and they're
talking to each other.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:90%
They're communicating.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are now
experiments, like Allais,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
which we believe have
actually detected

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
these waves of
interfering action

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:90%
between these separate bodies.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So in the
eclipse, the moon

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
passing in front of
the sun is causing

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
like a glitch in the
waves that are moving.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: As George Lucas
said, a "tremor in the Force."

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A tremor in
the Force, indeed.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So how's the coming
solar eclipse

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
relate to the torsion
hyperdimensional physics?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.945 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, for
one thing, it's unique.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't happened
in the United States

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that we had an
eclipse for 18 years.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
For another, it's not just
your ordinary eclipse.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
A total eclipse is
when the moon is

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
at the right distance
from the Earth

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
so it completely
blots out the sun,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and you see the
much fainter corona

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, super hot
plasma streaming off into space.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
This is what's called
an annular eclipse,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
meaning the moon is far
enough away from the Earth

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that the shadow doesn't
reach the Earth.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So what you'll see in
this eclipse track,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
if you were in China or in Tokyo
or in the American Southwest,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
over the space of several
hours, as the Earth is rotating

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and the moon is moving
around the Earth,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
you will see this
shadow, or this

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
annulus, projected in
the sky against the sun.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see what's basically
called a ring of fire.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
incredibly interesting,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because the average
daylight will not

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
appear that much different.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The photosphere of the sun is so
bright compared to the corona.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It's about a million times
brighter than the corona.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So it'll appear to be
like a cloudy afternoon.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But birds and other
animals may respond

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
not to the light change, but
to the torsion field phenomenon

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
change as the Allais
effect takes place

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.977 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of
living organisms.

00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that I've

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:84%
got some folks looking
at to see if they notice

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
any unusual behavior
of birds and animals

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:90%
in their immediate vicinity.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
what Allais found,

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
which is when you obscure the
sun, 92 million miles away,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
with the moon, which
is 240,000 miles away,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
weird stuff happens
in the ether.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
try, in Albuquerque,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
using some instrumentation we'll
talk about in a few minutes,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually measure
scientifically

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
with a different
technique than Allais

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
the actual scientific
phenomenology

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
of what happens
during an eclipse.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This kind
of goes back, also,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to the myths from medieval times
of bad tidings during eclipses

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and things that could've been
just this hyperdimensional

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
force, the animals
reacting to it and things--

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Oh, yeah.

00:11:18.235 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --and
created these myths.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: See,
most people think,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
when there's a
total eclipse, it's

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:84%
because it gets so dark that
animals think, oh, it's night,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to go to bed.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
An annular eclipse will allow us
to test-- in a qualitative way,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going to be
able to measure-- wire animals

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and see how they
respond with their EEGs.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to see
what their behavior is.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And if, in fact, they're
more in tune with the ether

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
than we are, which I think
is pretty well demonstrated,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
then they should respond equally
intriguingly during this kind

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of eclipse as they would
during a total eclipse.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: OK.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.955 align:middle line:90%
So what's a Venus transit?

00:11:53.955 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
In June, we have this
Venus transit coming.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.497 align:middle line:90%
What is a Venus transit?

00:11:57.497 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, in
essence, it's a mini eclipse.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: This is a
plot that was put out

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
by NASA some years
ago, before 2003.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
Venus orbit, you can

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
get these transits of
the disc of Venus, which

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
is a planet the
size of the Earth,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
25 million miles away between
us and the sun during a transit.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
In this shot, on the
right, you see Venus

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:90%
during the 2003 transit.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
There are two sets of
transits eight years apart

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:90%
every, roughly, 113 years.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way the orbits of
the solar system are lined up,

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
like here, you can see
that the orbit of Venus

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.594 align:middle line:84%
is not exactly in the line
with the orbit of the Earth.

00:12:37.594 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can only
get a transit when

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.739 align:middle line:84%
you're at what's
called the node, which

00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:41.655 align:middle line:90%
is the crossing point.

00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:90%
There are two of those.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch the Earth go
around the sun on a computer

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and watch Venus go around the
sun on a computer, every 113

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
or so years, on average,
you get an alignment

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
where Venus, appearing
from the Earth,

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.879 align:middle line:90%
can cross the disc of the sun.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
Earth-- in essence,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
a twin-- crossing 25
million miles away.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see how tiny it
appears compared to the almost

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
million-mile
diameter of the sun.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
In theory, in the
torsion field model,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
the big eclipse, which
is our own moon eclipsing

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the sun on the left, and Venus
crossing the sun on the right,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
are two different scaled
versions of the same thing.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
What we're going
to be trying to do

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
two weeks after
the solar eclipse

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
is to measure--
hopefully from Egypt;

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that's a whole other story--
the torsion phenomenon that we

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
see with Venus crossing the
sun that we were actually

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
able to measure during the
2003 transit eight years ago.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Hm.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So how could a planet
25 million miles away

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on us?

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: George Lucas--
a tremor in the Force.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When I was sitting at Coral
Castle, what Robin and I did

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
is that we could not
make it to Egypt.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Small problem of expense.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Enterprise is not supported
by your local friendly space

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:90%
agency or government, et cetera.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.079 align:middle line:84%
We depend on donations and
people who understand our work.

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:12.245 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to know how
to donate to enterprise,

00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
go to enterprisemission.com,
look at the Paypal button

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
up there, and give
us something so we

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
can get there and measure it.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.575 align:middle line:84%
So we took the poor
man's route in 2003.

00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We went to Coral Castle,
which is south of Miami.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
This was built by a guy
named Ed Leedskalnin, who

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:90%
was an immigrant, a stonemason.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The story goes that he came
here in the 1920s, lovelorn.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And he built this 1,000-ton
edifice out of carbon--

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, limestone,
which has carbon in it,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
calcium carbonate-- in homage
to his lost sweet 16 love.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I frankly think, having
measured now the torsion field

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
properties during
this transit in 2004,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that he was actually
building something that

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
could do what we did, that he
was part of a secret group--

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
remember, he was a
stonemason-- stonemason,

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.277 align:middle line:90%
Mason-- you get the drift there?

00:15:05.277 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Gotcha.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: So we measured,
during that entire evening,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.376 align:middle line:84%
the transit of
Venus across the sun

00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
with this technology,
which we're

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about in a second.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see from this
graph, when Venus reached

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
what's called third contact,
which is when the limb of Venus

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
just kissed the edge of the
sun, you can see on the graph

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that all hell broke
loose-- stunning excursions

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And they persisted for hours
after this event as Venus,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
which rotates backwards, was
rotating in the ether counter

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, which
rotates forward.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So you had, like, stirring
cream in a coffee cup

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of a solar system scale
on this particular event.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And here's an actual
scale model showing

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
where Venus was at the
very end of the transit,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
like some hours later.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
This is where it was projected
against a solar eclipse.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So you could see geometrically
in space where it was.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is the actual
plot of the response

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
of our instrumentation to Venus.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, we now know that
we get huge effects.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is to
get huge effects again.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember, science
is replication.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the
cornerstone of taking

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the hyperdimensional model
and turning it from a myth,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
from something that
skeptics go, oh, come on,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:90%
that can't be real.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:90%
We all know what physics is.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We're putting real
meat on the bones

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
here, because we're
demonstrating,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
in the historical legacy
of Maurice Allais,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.995 align:middle line:84%
that there is a lot more going
on in heaven and Earth-- you

00:16:41.995 --> 00:16:45.429 align:middle line:84%
know, Horatio-- than is dreamed
of in your current physics.

00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting a ripple
in the force, as you say,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.702 align:middle line:84%
by these planets
moving in front.

00:16:51.702 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So if we can imagine,
if the solar system

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.662 align:middle line:84%
was filled with water, we would
see these ripples and wakes.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Absolutely.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.907 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we can't see it,
so we don't think it exists.

00:17:00.907 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: But we have
two ways we can detect it.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
One is instrumentation,
if you design it properly.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And the other is people.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
This force, this
matrix, this ether,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
when it wiggles and moves
and shakes like Jell-O,

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
it affects consciousness,
both human consciousness

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:90%
and animal consciousness.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're the most
sensitive detectors.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of us ignore
that kind of response.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
There are some people, a
lot of people listening

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to this network, who are tuned
to pay attention to that stuff.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So I would tell
everybody on Sunday

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
afternoon, on the 20th, pay
attention to the animals

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:90%
in your vicinity.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
If they start acting
strange and different

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or do unusual little
things, make a note of it.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Put it on Facebook.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Send us a note,
because that's data

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
as much as the hard
instrumentation

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be using.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I suppose
any people, too.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Absolutely.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What you're feeling or
what your neighbors are feeling

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
or what's going on in your
neighborhood might be relevant.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.206 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: But see, people
are much more inhibited,

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
so they have social graces where
they will restrain impulses,

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%
whereas animals won't.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:90%
They'll be totally honest.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And just watch them.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've got lots and
lots of people out there.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
We could have detectors
all over the Southwest,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
responding to what they
see in their environment

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:90%
vis-a-vis other life forms.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So 2012 has three
of these eclipses going on

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Mayans were
really interested in Venus.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.295 align:middle line:90%
There's a Venus transit.

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And we know they were
really interested

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:90%
in lunar and solar eclipses.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's a solar eclipse.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're marking
the sun going

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
across the center of the galaxy.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's the
whole lore behind

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
it is actually an
astronomical lore

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
of these ripples in the wake of
the higher dimensional fields.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: You get the Emmy.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's going on.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, did the Mayans understand
about hyperdimensional torsion

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:90%
field physics?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I think, when we have more time
someday, I can prove they did.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.845 align:middle line:90%
And the proof is so astonishing.

00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:07.729 align:middle line:84%
It only came to me
through a Mayan guide

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:90%
we had when we went down there.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
NBC sent us down to
do some measurements,

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
which I'll talk
about in a minute.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
When I came home, I
did some research,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
pending what this Mayan
guide had told me to do.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I found, in
mainstream archaeological digs

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and interpretation of
Mayan artifacts found

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in some of these places,
unequivocal proof the Mayans

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
at least had the symbology
of the torsion field model.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether they understood
the physics of it

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
or they were basically
following a script that someone

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
had told them, the fact is that
their whole trip about this

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is the end of a cycle, the
beginning of another cycle,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
coinciding, as John Major
Jenkins has been saying

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
for years, with this
winter solstice alignment,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
we can prove now
is real physics.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And the step to proving
it is this coming eclipse

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of days and then
the Venus transit two weeks

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
after that, because you
can't argue with the graphs.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't argue with the data.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
our experiments,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
as went on with Allais, is
unequivocally real and cannot

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:90%
be denied or gainsaid.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be answered.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more people who
participate in this process,

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
the sooner we're going
to get breakthroughs that

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
will lead to all
kinds of other things

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
that our society now
desperately needs to put to--

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We'll get to
that in a second.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back to the
science for a second,

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:90%
so bolster our case here.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Who is Bruce De Palma,
and what did he discover?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: OK.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's my friend Bruce.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer with us.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
He died tragically
in the early '90s.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate
to meet him.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
He's, by the way, the brother of
Brian De Palma, the very famous

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:90%
film director.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Bruce was a genius.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
When he was back
at MIT, he started

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
looking into the properties
of rotating systems.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:90%
And he devised this experiment.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what's called the De
Palma spinning ball experiment.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
He built a device.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
He was a mechanical--
gentleman of all trades.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:84%
There aren't very many
experimental physicists

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
who are also good
theoreticians who

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.348 align:middle line:84%
also are good with their
hands and can actually

00:21:16.348 --> 00:21:18.229 align:middle line:84%
go into a machine shop
and make something.

00:21:18.229 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, he built all
the stuff himself,

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't have the
money to hire a machine shop.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
He built a device that could
eject two balls, two steel

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
pinballs, simultaneously,
one rotating at 27,000 RPM,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.475 align:middle line:90%
27,000 revolutions per minute--

00:21:34.475 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's pretty fast.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.559 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --the other,
stationary, simultaneously.

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he photographed
them, because he--

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
when the protege of
Edwin Land at Polaroid

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and a guy named Edgerton,
who would develop the strobe

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
system of photography, where
you can make fast things

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
stand still by flashing
light at thousands of frames

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
per second-- which, by the
way, is back to your airplane

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:90%
problem we'll talk about later.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so he did this
in a darkened room,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
photographed the two
balls, and noticed

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that the ball that was spinning
went higher and farther

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
than the ball that
was not spinning.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, right away,
this is impossible.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
In Newtonian mechanics,
rotation plays no part at all.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:84%
F equals ma, action
equals reaction, all

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:90%
that, the first three laws.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So he was getting results
that were totally amazing.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
He tried to go to
some very big people,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
like John Wheeler at
Princeton-- black hole John

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Wheeler, the big physicist.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
John Wheeler literally
ushered him out of his office

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and closed the door,
would not talk to him.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Which indicates to me that
John Wheeler already knew this,

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
suppressed science,

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
because what Bruce had done is
to find from this experiment

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
something very correlative
to what Allais had found,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
which is that
rotation-- remember,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
a pendulum motion
is a mini rotation--

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Bruce found with
his spinning ball

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to get
rotations that completely

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:90%
changed inertia.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:90%
He took the next step.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Then he figured out, OK, how can
I measure this scientifically?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And he went to a brand new
technology, which had just

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:84%
been invented by the
Bulova Watch Company,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:90%
called the Accutron watch.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It was brought out
in '65 and still was

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
kind of glitzy and new and
space age and all that.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And he took this wristwatch
called the Spaceview, which

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:84%
was the first new thing in
timekeeping in 300 years,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
according to Bulova,
because, instead of a balance

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
wheel and springs and all that,
you had a little tuning fork.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a close-up
of the tuning fork.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it vibrated at 360
times per second, 360 Hertz.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
He then took this
watch, glued it

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of a
Westclox, run off the grid,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
above a spinning disc with
a metal shield-- that's

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that bar up in the top
there-- so you didn't get

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
any electromagnetic or
electrostatic effects.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:84%
He then ran it
for 1,000 seconds.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And the watch lost a second
in only 1,000 seconds.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the watch that's
supposed to be accurate to one

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
or two seconds per day.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
In 1,000 seconds, 17 minutes,
it lost a full second.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
He then realized-- this was
the first of many experiments--

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.325 align:middle line:84%
that he had a little detector
within this vibrating tuning

00:24:21.325 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:84%
fork, because the tuning
fork going back and forth

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
is also partial rotation.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
This was a stunning
demonstration

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that even a rotating
object, when

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
you place another rotating
object in its vicinity,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
will change properties,
will change effects,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
will change its response to
the invisible matrix, the ether

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that is somehow being
swirled in its vicinity

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
just by the fact
of it's rotation.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
That is how, across 25
million miles of space,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Venus can impact and
affect the Earth.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a breadboard now
of the Accutron system

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have devised based on De
Palma's basic experiment, which

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:84%
we, of course, are going
to be using in the eclipse

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.301 align:middle line:90%
measurements on Sunday.

00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, we'll
get back to that.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:90%
That's really fascinating.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jay Weidner, and you're
watching "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.539 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be back
here in just a couple seconds--

00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:90%
a couple minutes, I mean.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.836 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:25:22.836 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Hey, I'm Jay Weidner.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.399 align:middle line:84%
We're back with
"Gaiam Inspirations"

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:90%
with Richard C. Hoagland.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
eclipse, the Venus transit,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the
Mayan calendar.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.027 align:middle line:84%
So Richard, let's get back
to the physics and things.

00:25:52.027 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about another guy that's

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
been a big influence
on all this,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
a Russian named
Nikolai-- I hope I

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.537 align:middle line:90%
pronounce this right-- Kozyrev.

00:25:59.537 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Perfect.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.078 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Thank you.

00:26:01.078 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And so who is he?

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: He's
another replicator.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Not like on "Stargate."

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Science has to be performed
to where independent guys come

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to the same conclusion based
on different experiments that

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:90%
show the same stuff.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Kozyrev was thrown in the Gulag
by Stalin back in the 1930s.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Young guy, incredible
genius, promising career,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.165 align:middle line:84%
ripped out of his
academic-- because Stalin

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:30.230 align:middle line:84%
was terrified of the
scientists, because they're

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.702 align:middle line:90%
the ones that knew stuff.

00:26:31.702 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So he basically murdered
a whole bunch of them,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and Kozyrev got swept up in it.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
He was let out just
after World War II.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:84%
In those years in the Gulag,
when he had nothing to do,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
when he was freezing to death,
when he was starving to death,

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:90%
all he could do was think.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So he was an astrophysicist.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So he went back and,
from first causes,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
recalculated
everything he thought

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
he'd known from
his academic trip

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
into basic questions
like why do stars shine?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
they cannot shine,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
according to his conceptual
modeling-- remember,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
in his cell, middle of
the night, long winters,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
long bread lines,
long everything.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was hard
labor with a death sentence

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
He's thinking about these
cosmic ideas with the freedom

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:90%
to do nothing but think.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.661 align:middle line:84%
Not exactly what I would
prefer to do to think.

00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But he came to the same
conclusion that we have,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
which is physical laws,
as currently put forward

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
by science, cannot explain
the really interesting stuff

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, he went further.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
He devised
instrumentation to begin

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to measure what he called the
physical properties of time.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:90%
And this is-- what is it?

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a torsion pendulum.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It rotates.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So he's at the same level
of rotation and inertia

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that Allais was
and De Palma was.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:84%
He found that, if you
vibrate matter, just

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
shake it like the little
tuning fork in the Accutron,

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
you can see from the graph,
it loses or gains weight.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Just shaking it.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't do
it continuously,

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:90%
like a continuous curve.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It does it in quantum steps,
meaning that, at some level,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
the ether is quantitized,
far below what's

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%
called the Planck level.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So now we get to
the older Kozyrev,

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and he's wondering why,
with all his publications,

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
no one is beating
a path to his door.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Like in the United States, if
you build a better mousetrap,

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%
what will they do?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:90%
They won't even pay attention.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:90%
They'll go buy a cat.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Nobody said to
Kozyrev, oh, my god,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
you've cracked the biggest
unified field theory

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
problem of all time.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:90%
They just basically ignored him.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And now what the KGB
has done-- or whatever

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
its current iteration
is-- they've attacked him

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and his followers,
the scientists

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to replicate his
experiments, as being anti this

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and anti that and anti science
and in it for the money.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Does this sound
vaguely familiar?

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sounds like what
goes on in this country.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Kozyrev was
another incredible pioneer.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that makes me sad

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
is he didn't live
long enough to see us

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
independent guys in
the West replicating

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
his most fundamental experiments
and proving he was right.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, it
reminds me of some

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
of the stories
from ancient India.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have maybe had
a handle on some of this.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me wonder
about the Mayans, also.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, remember,
the Mayans are Indians.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They are.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.241 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: That's the long--

00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It's right.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.024 align:middle line:84%
In fact, "Maya" means
"illusion" in Sanskrit.

00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Yes.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So when you
were in Central America

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.855 align:middle line:84%
to measure the new physics at
several of the sacred Mayan

00:29:43.855 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
sites, at Teotihuacan,
especially,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.219 align:middle line:90%
what did you discover?

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: That they're right.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.494 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is so cool.

00:29:50.494 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time you got
a major network to give you

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
money to go and take a stunning
trip with a stunning redhead

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to stand on a pyramid
at dawn and break

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
the paradigm of
Einstein and Newton?

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't happen every day.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sounds pretty cool.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: This is me.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And the redhead's out of-- I
think she's taking the picture.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.281 align:middle line:90%
That's Jaime Maussan--

00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Hey, Jaime.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --the
guy in the hat.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good old Jaime.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.166 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: He's a UFO
researcher, for those of you

00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:90%
who don't know.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.689 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: And he used to
be the equivalent of Walter

00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Cronkite with "60
Minutes" in Mexico City,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
That's me with the laptop.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
The Accutron that we're
using is that little box

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
down right next to Maussan
on the fourth level

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Pyramid of the Sun.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid of the
Moon is behind me.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Robin and I spent a
week traipsing around,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
up and down pyramids, in
the middle of the night,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
at dawn, at high noon, me
getting terrible sunburns,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
her finding the aloe
plants so I could

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%
keep doing the experiments.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Doing field work is
not all a bed of roses.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But we got astonishing
data, again,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:84%
all because of the
effect of these pyramids

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:90%
on the little tuning fork.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The model was, in my mind,
if this physics was real,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.905 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids had to be so big
and so massive for one function

00:31:02.905 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and one function only-- huge,
static, solid-state amplifiers

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
of the torsion field.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so tiny.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, 10 to the minus
fifth of other forces.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why Kozyrev said it's so
small that it's been bypassed

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
by most physicists, because they
don't deal in rotating systems.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:90%
They deal in non-rotating.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just simpler
in the machine shop

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to make an experiment
that doesn't rotate.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So one of the predictions,
based on some Egyptian lore

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
time to go into,

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
was that, at dawn, if we stood
on the top of that pyramid,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that huge pyramid,
which in volume is about

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to the
Great Pyramid at Giza,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
there should be, at
sunrise, a dramatic change

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
in the torsion field,
which would change

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
the inertia of the tuning
fork, which would show up

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:90%
as a change in the graph.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, on these graphs,
down is up and up is down.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, the guys
that wrote this program,

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:84%
the increasing
frequency is down.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you see a
spike going down,

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that's really going
up in frequency.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The only way the tuning
fork can change frequency

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is if it either lost its
mind-- that's a metaphor--

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:90%
or it lost mass.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
vibrate faster.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It vibrated faster
just at sunrise.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Look at the spike.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at the numbers.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:90%
It's 400 and some Hertz.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It normally vibrates
at 360 Hertz.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:90%
That's an impossible change.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, a few minutes later,
it did it again even more,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:84%
like a double hump,
double peak, at dawn.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why, by the
way, all prisoners

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:90%
are shot at dawn, hung at dawn.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient cultural
thingy that the physics at dawn

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is different than at
other times of day.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This proves the
physics at dawn, which

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:90%
gets back to the Egyptian.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So what was the name
of the big guy in Egypt

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.199 align:middle line:90%
who was the god of sunrise?

00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Horace

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.531 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Horace.

00:32:56.531 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Horizon.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.246 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Horace
of the horizon.

00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:06.365 align:middle line:84%
So because the sun
is at 90 degrees,

00:33:06.365 --> 00:33:07.977 align:middle line:90%
it has an impact just like--

00:33:07.977 --> 00:33:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, think
of it as you're on a ball,

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're rotating
toward the sun.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:84%
The maximum rotation-- it's
more interesting than that,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.390 align:middle line:84%
but the maximum rotation is
at dawn, at the terminator.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more
like the angles.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
90 degrees is important
in the physics.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:90%
180 is important.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why conjunctions,
things lined up,

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:84%
or anticonjunctions, things on
the opposite side of the sun,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:90%
are important.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It's all ultimately
about the angles.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember when Clinton was
running for president,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and it was the economy, stupid?

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It's the angles, stupid.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.433 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: It's the
geometry, stupid.

00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Geometry.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.229 align:middle line:84%
Well, how can our audience help
you with these experiments?

00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, this is
where things get really cool.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have, hopefully,
a live webcast from Enterprise

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.929 align:middle line:90%
this coming Sunday.

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:90%
We're still working on details.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So watch Enterprise,
enterprisemission.com.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Watch my Facebook pages,
both the public page

00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and my friends page.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll be posting announcements
as we get closer.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I've got two stations lined up--
one in Phoenix, Arizona, run

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
by a guy named Bill
Alec, who helped

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
me create the first
Enterprise Accutron

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:84%
hyperdimensional torsion
field measurement system.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a gal
up in Chicago who's

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.672 align:middle line:84%
an IT specialist, who's built
her own Accutron system.

00:34:19.672 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:84%
She's gone out and
actually bought,

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:84%
on eBay, Accutrons,
put together software

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:84%
to measure the frequency
of the vibrating field.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to be running
a station in Chicago, which

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
is important because Chicago
is where the eclipse is

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:84%
over at sunset before
the Eclipse is over.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So we get a different
geometry, whereas, in Phoenix,

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:84%
it's well up in the sky,
and it is not actually

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
in the path of the
central annularity.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:90%
It's off to one side.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So we get geometry
which mimics more

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
what Allais saw
in Paris in 1954.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
And then we're right
on the center line.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And we are really
expecting some cool stuff.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
occurred to Kim,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
actually, when we were in
conversation a few days ago,

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
she said, I wonder
what's going to happen

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
to the grid, the
electrical power grid.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out
that the eclipse goes

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:90%
almost right over this place.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the 1930s
depression-era eighth wonder

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
of the world, Hoover Dam.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:84%
There are 17
2,000-ton generators,

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:84%
electrical generators, in
those powerhouses on both sides

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:84%
of the bottom of the dam,
generating almost 2,000

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.840 align:middle line:84%
megawatts-- that's 2
gigawatts-- of electricity.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And how are they doing it?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:84%
By taking the falling water
that comes down the sluices

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
from behind that damn, spinning
what's called a Francis

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
turbine, and rotating
the generators up

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
in those powerhouses at
90 revolutions per minute.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:90%
But they weigh 2,000 tons.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So if the physics is
dependent on momentum,

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:84%
which we think it
is, the interaction

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
between those massive
spinning generators,

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.530 align:middle line:84%
which are feeding current
at 60 cycles per second

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:84%
into the grid from
southern Nevada

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to the entire
American Southwest,

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:84%
should show up as ripples
in your house current, which

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
means that, potentially,
millions of people

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.400 align:middle line:84%
could go to Radio Shack
and get, for a few bucks,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:84%
a digital meter
that could record,

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
when you stick it in the
wall socket, the frequency

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of your power and could
see a tremor in the force

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
in their electrical
house current

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
from the eclipse
impacting the rotating

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.399 align:middle line:84%
generators all under
that eclipse track.

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.394 align:middle line:90%
So a voltmeter, plug it in--

00:36:43.394 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Not a voltmeter.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
This would be a frequency meter.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Frequency meter.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.816 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: You want to
measure the frequency.

00:36:47.816 --> 00:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Tesla
gave us the 60-cycle

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:90%
alternating current system.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Why did he give us 60 cycles?

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
That's another
interesting story.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.574 align:middle line:90%
Tesla knew all this stuff.

00:36:57.574 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:84%
You can measure the
change in frequency.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Kim was
measuring the other day,

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh, this is
weird, because she was measuring

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.425 align:middle line:84%
62 cycles per second
in a grid system

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that's supposed
to be held at 60.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
If it deviates more than
a few percentage points

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.410 align:middle line:84%
from that frequency,
the computers

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
are told to drop those
power stations off the line

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the entire
grid from collapsing.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.077 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this
eclipse-- and we'll

00:37:22.077 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:90%
get into this in a second.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:84%
There's some
astrologers saying this

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.621 align:middle line:84%
is the most incredible eclipse
they've seen in their analyses

00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh yeah.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Heard the same thing.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: --generations.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Maybe it's because
it could have a ripple effect,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and the entire power
grid system could

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.550 align:middle line:84%
be triggered to go down, which,
of course, what would happen?

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It would raise
people's consciousness

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, what the
hell happened with that?

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would start
asking important questions,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot more,
when you get into the biology

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and biography of
Hoover Dam and when

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
it was done-- I mean, the
first thing, if you want

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to look at it symbolically,
why are there 17 generators?

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Not 18, not 16-- 17 at
the base of Hoover Dam.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that's an
incredibly important number

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:84%
connected to Osiris
and to Horace

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and to the whole Egyptian
mythology we've been tracking

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.250 align:middle line:84%
through NASA, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Once you start pulling on one
little thread of this matrix,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.089 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of other
things become unravelled.

00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, that's true.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think you've painted
a pretty good understanding

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
of how this works and the
ripple effects and things.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But how does all
this information

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.287 align:middle line:84%
affect the average person
that's just watching?

00:38:35.287 --> 00:38:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, let me start
with the more interesting

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:90%
effects first.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.849 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows the
concept of astrology.

00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And they also know, if
they listen to Carl Sagan,

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:84%
it's all nonsense,
that the obstetrician,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.400 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of birth, has
10,000 times the gravity

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of Jupiter, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.472 align:middle line:84%
Problem is the effects
are not gravitational.

00:38:54.472 --> 00:38:55.555 align:middle line:90%
They're not electrostatic.

00:38:55.555 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not magnetic.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They're nothing in
terms of the physics

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.175 align:middle line:90%
lexicon of known forces.

00:39:00.175 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They're hyperdimensional.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: They're
hyperdimensional and torsion.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And those torsion effects
are due to rotation.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Here's an astrology chart.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, look what the astrologer
who put this together,

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
who, of course, I'd
never talked to--

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Is this the eclipse?

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.183 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: This is the eclipse.

00:39:14.183 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
This is for the 20th of May,
three or four days from now.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Look what he says, that the
impact, astrologically, of this

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
eclipse-- I've just
been laying out

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
the physics of why it
could be pretty amazing.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But suppose it did bring
down part of the grid because

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:84%
of the torsion interference
with the rotating

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:90%
generators at Boulder Dam.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That would cause a lot
of people to wake up.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It would also cause a lot of
problems, practically speaking.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.800 align:middle line:90%
It would cause questions.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
People would say, well,
why isn't it more robust?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
What caused it?

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.694 align:middle line:84%
The engineers would
have no answer

00:39:53.694 --> 00:39:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that they can talk
about publicly.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they go to you
and get an explanation.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.373 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Hopefully,
they'll go to people,

00:39:58.373 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
like our experiments,
and begin to look

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.980 align:middle line:90%
for deeper and deeper answers.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We call this-- big deal--
hyperdimensional astrology,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
astrology works,

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.344 align:middle line:84%
because that configuration
of the torsion

00:40:11.344 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:84%
field at the moment
of your birth-- now,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:90%
why is it the moment of birth?

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.370 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, why isn't it
the moment of conception?

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Ah,
because, guess what

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.950 align:middle line:84%
one of the best screening
elemental pieces of matter

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.633 align:middle line:90%
are for torsion fields?

00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Uh, I think I
can guess, but go ahead.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Water.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: We're 97% water.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the
baby's in the water.

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: The baby has to
come out of its shielding

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to be exposed to
the torsion fields.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it's birth.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Science is nothing if
it's not prediction.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is another
interesting effect.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy named
Jim Flynn, James Flynn.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:84%
He's a psychologist
from New Zealand, went

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to the University of Chicago,
published a very controversial

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:84%
paper called "The
Flynn Effect," which

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:90%
has to do with this graph.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:84%
He took military and
other standardized tests

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.720 align:middle line:84%
for the last 100 years
from all over the world,

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.220 align:middle line:84%
put them together, and noticed
an astonishing phenomenon

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:84%
which, at the moment,
has no explanation.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
IQ scores have
monatomically risen--

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.294 align:middle line:84%
you can see the graph there,
going up to the right.

00:41:13.294 --> 00:41:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter whether it's

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:84%
video game babies or
people on Facebook--

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Or race or sex--

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --or
Hottentots in Africa

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.550 align:middle line:84%
or the guys in the Amazon that
just saw their first airplane.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of culture,
sex, race, location; IQ,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:84%
as measured by these
standardized tests,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:90%
has been going up.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, Flynn himself
said, come on,

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:84%
this is nonsense, because if
this data is what it represents

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to be, we should be doing
more interesting things

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
than the Renaissance,
Leonardo da Vinci and all

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that amazing cornucopia
of stunning invention

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that led to the 21st century.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:84%
What I think-- and this is after
long conversations with Robin--

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think IQ stands
for intelligence.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the IQ
stands for intuition,

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.370 align:middle line:84%
because, why are these
tests standardized?

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.344 align:middle line:90%
Because they're multiple choice.

00:42:09.344 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And in a multiple choice
test, the first thing

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.180 align:middle line:84%
the test examiner
will tell you is,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.004 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
the answer, guess.

00:42:15.004 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Go with
your first feeling.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Go with
your first gut instinct.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: So what's happening
is the guessing quotient

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.409 align:middle line:90%
is going up.

00:42:21.409 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And they're right.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: And that
indicates that they

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:84%
are more right in
their higher brains?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:90%
They're more plugged in.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.800 align:middle line:90%
They're more connected.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The torsion field changes,
the accelerating physics,

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.200 align:middle line:84%
which the Mayans talk about--
even though they don't do it

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
in plain Mayan, that's what
they're really talking about--

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.120 align:middle line:84%
is accelerating to a
nodal point around 2012.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why the calendar
was made to end

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and the new cycle begin then.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And this Flynn effect
is, again, Western

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:84%
quantifiable science data that
human consciousness is changing

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.719 align:middle line:84%
and we're all
becoming more in tune.

00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I think a lot of people
can feel that right now.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:90%
There's an awakening going on.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think people can
feel it everywhere.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, just look
at every politician, which,

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, is
compelled, like Jim Carrey,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to tell the truth.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Stunning.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Just watch the candidates.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.180 align:middle line:90%
They have to blurt out--

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They can't lie
as well as they used to.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.399 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: And
they don't even try.

00:43:19.399 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like something-- it
started with George Bush.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:90%
He started telling the truth.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
latest is Joe Biden

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:84%
was asked on "Meet the
Press" a couple Sundays ago,

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and look what that led to.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:84%
He just blurted out
his inner feelings.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, other people are
blurting out their feelings.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Watch what they're saying,
because the physics

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
prediction is the good
are getting better

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and the bad are getting worse.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.228 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's for sure.

00:43:43.228 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: And they're
doing it all in public.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Mm.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a practical
level for this new physics.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we
could get free energy

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:84%
or pollution-free devices
using hyperdimensional torsion

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.210 align:middle line:90%
physics?

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: You want the long
answer or the short answer?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.091 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I know the short answer.

00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Give me the long answer.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Oh.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, the short answer is yes.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The long answer is, we don't
quite yet, in the white world,

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:90%
know how to do it.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The black world has known
about all of this for decades.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The military
industrial complex has

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:84%
been sitting on all
this really cool stuff.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's based on hyperdimensional
torsion field physics.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.840 align:middle line:90%
What I want to do--

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You're talking
about weaponry--

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Weaponry and--

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:23.861 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --and craft.

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --antigravity
and all the really cool toys

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.060 align:middle line:90%
that we hear rumors about.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.610 align:middle line:84%
They're real,
because they're based

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.140 align:middle line:84%
on the real physics, which is
hyperdimensional torsion field

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.990 align:middle line:84%
physics, and not on
the fake physics, which

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
is Newton and Einstein
and those guys.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.920 align:middle line:84%
There are two separate
parallel tracks.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.430 align:middle line:84%
There's the public track,
where nothing interesting

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.664 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:44:43.664 --> 00:44:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Relativity doesn't let you
go to the speed of light.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.455 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can come to
us from other stars.

00:44:47.455 --> 00:44:49.430 align:middle line:90%
We can't go there.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.414 align:middle line:84%
What was the four laws
of thermodynamics?

00:44:51.414 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Things will get worse
before they get better--

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Entropy.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --and who says
things will get better?

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Entropy's going to
kill us and all that.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:58.034 align:middle line:90%
Not if there's other dimensions.

00:44:58.034 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Not true.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Yes.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think the
hyperdimensional torsion field

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.707 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for the
life phenomenon itself.

00:45:07.707 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If we had another two
hours, I would lay out

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:84%
experiments that show that
this is the life force,

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
this is the chi, this
is the-- everybody

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:90%
gives it a different name.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's ultimately the same
phenomenon, the same stuff.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we need to do is to
basically represent it in a way

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that the mainstream
gets, in which case

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:32.500 align:middle line:84%
we then get energy
sources that don't wind up

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.257 align:middle line:90%
killing us and our pocketbook--

00:45:34.257 --> 00:45:35.382 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And our environment.

00:45:35.382 --> 00:45:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: --and
our environment.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't wind up but raping the
Earth for hydrocarbons, which

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:84%
are a potentially limited--
although that's really

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.190 align:middle line:84%
now debatable-- but even
if they were unlimited,

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.690 align:middle line:84%
who would want to be burning
hydrocarbons for the next 1,000

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Indeed.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.248 align:middle line:84%
It would almost be better
if they were limited.

00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Exactly.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.973 align:middle line:84%
Because it would force
us to go to something

00:45:52.973 --> 00:45:55.120 align:middle line:84%
else to keep from killing
billions of people.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.157 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
here is that, when

00:45:57.157 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
materiality, when you're

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.120 align:middle line:84%
dealing with equations that have
to do with energy, information,

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.860 align:middle line:84%
resources; unless you increase
something dramatically,

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.725 align:middle line:84%
the current trend curve
is very, very negative.

00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Look at these arrows.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, I know it is.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: And these
were, like, five years ago.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:90%
They're much worse now.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to have
a technology, what

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:84%
we call a game
changer, introduced

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.750 align:middle line:84%
into the common public, common
wheel, which doesn't pollute

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, doesn't
destroy the planet,

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
doesn't impact people's
lives, like fracking

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's the side effects
of mining for hydrocarbons,

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:84%
like coal, destroying whole
mountains in West Virginia

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and in the Appalachians to get
a few thousand tons of coal

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:90%
to burn, to do what?

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.114 align:middle line:84%
To go to the drugstore,
the bar, the whatever?

00:46:50.114 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And throw more
pollution into the atmosphere.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Yeah,
exactly, because we also

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.220 align:middle line:84%
do have a serious
greenhouse problem,

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
the gainsayers notwithstanding.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good idea, as these
cycles keep turning over,

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:90%
to put more CO2 in the air.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:90%
How do we counter all that?

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:84%
This physics means
we will no longer

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:84%
have young Americans
dying in resource wars

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.469 align:middle line:84%
like Iraq, which
was fought for oil.

00:47:13.469 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's good.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: We can
bring them home.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to have
them all over the world,

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
defending an empire that is
based on a false premise.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:84%
This physics will allow,
when it matriculates

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:28.600 align:middle line:84%
in the public arena into
an appropriate technology,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:84%
an ability to create
electricity out of the ether,

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.150 align:middle line:90%
out of the vacuum.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And ether energy,
ether electricity

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.330 align:middle line:90%
is inherently non-pollutionous.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't turn into waste heat.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.650 align:middle line:84%
That's another key
aspect of this,

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.810 align:middle line:84%
because, if you really open the
gates to a higher dimension,

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.630 align:middle line:90%
you wind up killing entropy.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for instance--
I'm going to widely diverge

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.010 align:middle line:84%
here-- the reports of
ghostly phenomenon--

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.510 align:middle line:84%
which, again, is part
of the torsion field--

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.852 align:middle line:84%
they have a lowered
lower temperature.

00:47:58.852 --> 00:48:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You'll talk about,
oh, there was a chill.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, right.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.365 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Why
is there a chill?

00:48:02.365 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:84%
It's because entropy
goes out the window.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.470 align:middle line:84%
When you get more
ordered, you get

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:90%
random thermal motion ceases.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
temperature goes down.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's a measure of
the coherence between a higher

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:84%
dimension and an
unlimited source of energy

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and our limited 3D reality.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no limit
to the implications

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.195 align:middle line:84%
of measuring and
proving this physics.

00:48:23.195 --> 00:48:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to be

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.989 align:middle line:90%
doing very publicly this Sunday.

00:48:26.989 --> 00:48:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Well, good luck on that.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.072 align:middle line:84%
I hope you succeed
in what you find.

00:48:30.072 --> 00:48:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, I bet you're
going to ask me to come back

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.075 align:middle line:90%
and show you--

00:48:33.075 --> 00:48:34.283 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, I am going to ask.

00:48:34.283 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
back several times.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Mayan calendar, of
course, it's coming to an end

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:39.740 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.432 align:middle line:90%
What's your expectations for it?

00:48:41.432 --> 00:48:42.390 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Exactly the
opposite of all the doomsayers.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Good.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: I think that
the Mayans were trying

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to tell us--
remember, "apocalypse"

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.595 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean "catastrophe."

00:48:49.595 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:90%
It means "enlightenment."

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It means "the veil lifting."

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:84%
We are in a race between
the physics of reality--

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.900 align:middle line:84%
meaning entropy, 3D
geology, meteorology stuff--

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and the physics of the
torsion field interaction

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness
is going to win,

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because we respond the quickest
of all these physical systems.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're watching
things like the Flynn effect

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and like politicians,
who, somehow, even

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:84%
against their
better judgment, are

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.149 align:middle line:84%
forced to tell the-- remember,
a gaffe in Washington

00:49:21.149 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is when a politician
tells the truth.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.372 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, you notice
it happening more and more.

00:49:25.372 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not an accident.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.310 align:middle line:84%
That's part of this
changing physics

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.310 align:middle line:90%
that we're all caught up in.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The bright ones, the sharp
ones, the smart ones,

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the conscious ones
will reach out now

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
for explanations as to
why this is occurring

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and how they can make it occur
more often in their own lives.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, lying is an
unnatural thing anyway.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: We have to
keep remembering the lie.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You've got to keep
remembering all your lies.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets impossible.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.137 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
big relief, probably,

00:49:51.137 --> 00:49:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell the
truth for these guys.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.044 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:49:54.044 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: I don't think
it's that conscious.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, I don't, either.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: I think it's
just like "Liar Liar."

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Remember Jim Carrey?

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Phenomenal movie.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.701 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: That's what
I think's going on.

00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:05.552 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I was slightly
conspiratorial bent--

00:50:05.552 --> 00:50:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Which you're
not, of course.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Well,
I-- you know, there

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:13.380 align:middle line:84%
are rumors out there-- I would
think that movie was designed

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and written and
produced and directed

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and put out there by
someone who understood this.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Hollywood
is a huge font.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've analyzed
Kubrick to death.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood is where the
truth is being told.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But, as Emily Dickinson used
to say, "tell all the truth,

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.509 align:middle line:90%
but tell it slant."

00:50:29.509 --> 00:50:30.925 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell
it to us directly.

00:50:30.925 --> 00:50:32.890 align:middle line:90%
They tell it to us in symbology.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And Jim Carrey's
"Liar Liar" I think

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.590 align:middle line:84%
was perfectly made for
the consciousness effects

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of this physics on people now
who are more and more inspired

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.945 align:middle line:90%
or impelled to tell their truth.

00:50:45.945 --> 00:50:47.207 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Well, that sounds good.

00:50:47.207 --> 00:50:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
go to Facebook here.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:50.220 align:middle line:90%
We've got a few minutes left.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:55.330 align:middle line:84%
We have Linda is asking,
"What's the significance

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiadian
alignment on May

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.860 align:middle line:84%
20, the same day as
the solar eclipse?"

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So Alcyone in Pleiades is
going to be lined up directly

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.625 align:middle line:84%
with the sun and the
moon and the Earth.

00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:07.880 align:middle line:90%
We have four things in a row.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.605 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean anything?

00:51:08.605 --> 00:51:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Yes.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Pleiades are
a cluster of stars,

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:12.710 align:middle line:90%
several hundred stars--

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.626 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the Mayans
were obsessed with them.

00:51:14.626 --> 00:51:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Obsessed with
the position of the Pleiades.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The relationship between
the Pleiades and Venus

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.910 align:middle line:90%
is important in Mayan cosmology.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades themselves
are relatively close.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:90%
They're 420 light years away.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, alignments
in the physics

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:90%
cause a tremor in the force.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I've actually tried to measure
a close approach of the moon

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to the Pleiades with
the Accutron system.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And because I don't have
a pyramid in Enterprise's

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.590 align:middle line:84%
backyard, the signal
to noise is not

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.270 align:middle line:84%
great enough for me to
demonstrate unequivocally

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:90%
that there is an effect.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But there are hints
that there are effects.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Because of the unique geometry
of this solar eclipse,

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:84%
we might see something
in the data that

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.290 align:middle line:84%
would allow us to speak
more to her question.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
perceptive question.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I agree.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
do another Facebook.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Phil-- "Do you believe
all the catastrophes

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.269 align:middle line:84%
over the last few
years are signals

00:52:11.269 --> 00:52:12.310 align:middle line:90%
of the end of the world?"

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you
don't believe that.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: No, but I--

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It's the end
of one world, though,

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of another.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Well, all right.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:90%
How do you define "world?"

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's the end of
the world as we know it.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I see-- and it was
interesting, the president

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:84%
said this in Afghanistan
the other day--

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.410 align:middle line:90%
a new dawn on the horizon.

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The symbology being
spoken about at levels,

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
like they're talking
to other audiences

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to alert them to what's coming.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans were not
predicting catastrophe.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.760 align:middle line:84%
John is right--
John Major Jenkins.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.120 align:middle line:84%
They predicted
change, a revelation,

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.100 align:middle line:90%
a lifting of the veil.

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The physical problems we've had,
like earthquakes, tornadoes,

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and all that-- remember, that's
part of the physics, too.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The planet is adjusting
to the new torsion field.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And like with any
mechanical system,

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:84%
it has aches and
springs and whatever.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan used to say that
what is trivial to the planet

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:11.810 align:middle line:84%
has huge effects for beagles
and begonias on the planet.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, in the grand
scheme of things,

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
no, the human race is not
going to be wiped out.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But in the short term,
you need to pay attention

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.694 align:middle line:90%
to where you live.

00:53:20.694 --> 00:53:22.110 align:middle line:84%
If you live in an
earthquake zone,

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.110 align:middle line:84%
like Japan, during the
Fukushima earthquake,

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that was not a good
place to put a reactor.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.375 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: How idiotic to put
reactors in all continents next

00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to earthquake
zones, particularly

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.870 align:middle line:84%
if the tremors in
the force get bigger

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and you basically
change plate structure

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and you have entropy
dislocations, i.e.,

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.590 align:middle line:90%
called earthquakes.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
interesting the other day

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that Prince Charles,
when he was in Scotland--

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:84%
remember what
Scotland represents

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in the symbology-- Scottish
Rite Masons and all

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.191 align:middle line:84%
that-- he gave the
weather forecast.

00:53:58.191 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, I saw that.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: Why was
he doing the weather?

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Very amusing.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOAGLAND: I think it was
part of this secret code

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that weather is one
of the things being

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.980 align:middle line:90%
impacted by this physics.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Those tornadoes in Alabama were
stunning, devastating, totally

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.100 align:middle line:90%
out of season.

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.516 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, England
also has been

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:19.247 align:middle line:84%
going through the coldest
spring in 150 years.

00:54:19.247 --> 00:54:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Exactly.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.246 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: In fact, it's winter.

00:54:21.246 --> 00:54:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOAGLAND: Yep.

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But you see, these
are only problems

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.440 align:middle line:84%
if you don't socially
understand what's causing them

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and take steps to
prepare for them.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We need to become more
conscious, all of us,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that these are natural
parts of this cycle.

They can be dealt with.

00:54:35.695 --> 00:54:37.195 align:middle line:84%
The planet's not
going to disappear.

00:54:37.195 --> 00:54:39.410 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to lose
billions of people.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:90%
That's fear porn.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.340 align:middle line:84%
What we are going
to do, however,

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:47.370 align:middle line:84%
is to create a new dawn
of human capabilities

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.540 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, if
the physics continues

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to go where it's going,
that can possibly

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:56.570 align:middle line:84%
match the Golden Age
of the yuga cycles.

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that's a
great place to finish up.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:84%
We do hope a golden
age comes really soon.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Gaiam TV is going
to be part of that, we hope.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:84%
