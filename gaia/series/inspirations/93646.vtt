00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard the
phrase "don't cry over

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:84%
anything that doesn't
cry over you?"

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, why do we
cry over losing things

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:90%
like money or material things?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it actually hurts
like a loss of a person.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today is the
financial whisperer.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Pegi Burdick.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of a book
called "It's Never About

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
the Money ...Even When It Is."

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's joining us to talk
about why we personify money.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEGI BURDICK: Oh, listen,
thank you for inviting me.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.112 align:middle line:84%
You have such a great
history and story.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about,
first of all, you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
started off as a
mortgage broker, right?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Uh huh.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And counseling--
and how did you specifically

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
wound up being a financial
whisperer for women

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:90%
specifically?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: It really
started-- I was

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
vice president of a knitwear
company here in Los Angeles.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Knitworks?

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Knitwear.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: And we sold our
product through trunk shows

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So we had people living in
Houston, living in Charleston,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
living in New York,
putting these shows on.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And our factory was here,
on Tennessee in Los Angeles.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.265 align:middle line:84%
And I would get the orders
in every Monday morning

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because the show was
over Sunday night,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'd see duplicate
orders from people.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'd call up Mrs. Goldstein
and say, Mrs. Goldstein--

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Pegi, how are you?

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, fine.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to double check before
we process this for you.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
another black jacket?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.785 align:middle line:84%
You have all these
other jackets.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
You want-- And so that gives
you seven black jackets.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And she'd go, yup,
that's what I want.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.295 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say to myself,
why does someone

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:90%
need seven black jackets?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.725 align:middle line:84%
And this would
happen over and over?

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yes.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That would happen, and here's
one of my favorite ones.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We'd get orders
with two different

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.127 align:middle line:90%
or three different credit cards.

00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I call up the consultant--
let's say in Charleston--

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and say, how is this happening?

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.832 align:middle line:84%
You have three different ways
of paying for all these clothes.

00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
She's like, well, she doesn't
want her husband to find out.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So little by little, I
would witness and experience

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:90%
these stories.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, I was
in such denial myself,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
it was easy to look
at them and go, boy,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't make sense.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:90%
How ridiculous.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, my debt was going
like this, my personal debt.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's break that down into
two different parts, though.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
talk about, if we can,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the shopping
addiction for women,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
conversation about money,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.617 align:middle line:84%
and we've got a
lot to cover here.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to talk with you
about your own personal debt.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But why do you think
that women do that?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
That buy and buy how
many pairs of shoes?

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
How many purses do we need?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
How many black jackets
do we really need?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:90%
What is the addiction?

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.519 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, it
comes from many things,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
but the biggest problem
people have, across the board,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is a disconnection between
who they authentically are

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and who they've learned to
become in order to survive.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you have such
intense disconnection,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you also then have a lack
of emotional intimacy

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, with your
children, with your sister.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where the
richness of your life is,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
but if you can't access it,
you'll play with yourself.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.777 align:middle line:90%
You take yourself shopping.

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this feels good.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's not until later, then,
when the bill arrives, or you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
get home and you start
adding everything up

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and realize what you've
spent, the panic sets in.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But that euphoria of
control and that euphoria

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of having fun with yourself
is part of the addiction.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is an addiction.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, when you're in
the moment, there's

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
sales people and marketing,
and it's all marketed to buy.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You are marketed to buy
how many times a day?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:90%
2,000 times a day?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's--
yeah-- there's that.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So you have to not only have
awareness but hyper awareness.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I just recently moved,
and we literally gave away

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.552 align:middle line:84%
50%, if not more, of what we
had because we didn't need it.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in that space-- we
gave it to women's shelters

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and great places-- now we're
coming along the holiday

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:84%
season, and more gifts
are coming in the door.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say, no, we
don't need anything.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
We really don't need anything.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want, donate to
this, or maybe buy a plant

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to plant somewhere or a tree,
but people don't get it.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
disconnections in this space.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I want to dig into this.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.136 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
here's the thing.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.987 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember that we
are a consumer driven society.

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.361 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: And what do
advertisers play on?

00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They play on our
sense of inadequacy.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And who suffers more with
a sense of inadequacy?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Women more than men.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:90%
So here's a classic example.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:90%
You go into a store.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
need the jacket.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:90%
You want the jacket.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.761 align:middle line:84%
You put it on, and
meanwhile, that morning,

00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
you think-- you got on
the scale and, oh, god.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And you feel, you know, zaftig.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
You got a jacket on.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The woman goes, you
look so thin in that.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:90%
And you go, I'll buy it.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll buy two.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.498 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right?

00:05:12.498 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You let someone else
influence you that way.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the key, really,
if you're grounded,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
it's a nice compliment,
and let it be that.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I learned once that
Justin Bieber's marketing

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
company was actually
marketing towards the mothers

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than the children
of his same age range

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
because they're
the ones that buy.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
So we do have that.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a very strong
psychological marketing

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.360 align:middle line:84%
campaign going out
around the world.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So with that said, let's
talk about empowering

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:90%
ourselves more.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So adequacy around
ourselves and needing

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
more sense of completion
and that we're

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
fine without that
whatever it is, right?

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
everybody-- you have

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to take a step back and ask, why
does someone have the sense of,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:90%
nothing is ever good enough?

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.472 align:middle line:84%
Why are they not-- because
the essence of that

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:90%
is, why am I not good enough?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course,
connects to shame.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Why do we breed this mentality
over and over and over again?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and you've
read some of my stuff.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm the biggest supporters
of women, mothers.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm the biggest
protector of mothers.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm also holding them
accountable for making

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
certain mistakes when they
bring their children up.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So if the mother doesn't have it
together to teach her daughter,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
in this case, certain values,
then guess what happens?

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.382 align:middle line:90%
It just gets worse and worse.

00:06:36.382 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Generationally.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's no parachute
to catch them.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So the key is for the mother
to stand still and really build

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
some self awareness.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because without self awareness,
you can't move ahead.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't solve a problem.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing the same
thing over and over again,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.217 align:middle line:84%
and every-- and
you're the victim.

00:06:55.217 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's ever your fault.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:90%
This is your fault.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.832 align:middle line:90%
This thing is your fault.

00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:00.206 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
said that you were

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:90%
in a certain level of debt.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
How did you become self aware in
order to get rid of that debt?

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: I didn't
have a choice.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what happens
when you're in denial.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:84%
You are so invested in
this certain belief system.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
to me is that then I

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
said to my husband of 11 years,
this is not working for me.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We rented a beach house in
Redondo for $3,800 a month.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:90%
That was stupid.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I had sold my house, which
I worked so hard to buy.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:90%
And I spent the money foolishly.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I invested in something
incredibly stupid.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit
that had not been settled yet.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
One of my dogs was dying.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So everything--
every structure that

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
would be something you
could stand on and count on

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
was suddenly disappearing,
because the more invested you

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:84%
are in denial, the
harder it is going

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to be for someone to finally
take a crowbar into your life

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.237 align:middle line:90%
so you can go, oh, my god.

00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I've got to make a change.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:90%
There's only one way out.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
pick to do that way.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Or not.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when
you got a blueprint

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of the financial despair
that you were in,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.796 align:middle line:84%
what did you do with
that information?

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
first of all, it

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.329 align:middle line:84%
was a real shock to my friends,
because I always came across

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:84%
as the one that was
the most competent one.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I was the leader.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:90%
I had everything together.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
When I had to admit
to some of my friends

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that I was going under,
they were, like, shocked.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of them gave me some
really, really good advice.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
But I had to then implement it.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the catch.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- hopefully we
talk about sabotage later--

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is that getting
information isn't enough.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to go use it.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So "The Artist's Way,"
Hay House-- Louise

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
did this great book on
you can heal yourself.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
There's great
material out there.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Suze Orman had just
come out with her book

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:90%
on women and finance.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.812 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading it, and
I realized, you know what?

00:08:50.812 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I might be able to do
this, but I didn't really

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:84%
have a path, because I didn't
have a job at the time.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I was in between all the stuff.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And I hired a career coach.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
She was at least the
first time in my life

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that anyone ever asked
me-- and by that time,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, what, 58-- what
is it that makes you happy?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
what do you mean?

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- really,
she got me to drill down.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
What makes me happy
is helping people.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And helping people
is by teaching.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I only had three
sessions with her.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Man, I took off like a bat.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.302 align:middle line:84%
So that's someone-- I hit the
right person at the right time,

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:90%
because I think--

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you were ready.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yes.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.856 align:middle line:84%
Because you know this
with the universe.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
When you ask, and
you're clean about it,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.146 align:middle line:84%
the universe gives you
exactly what you need.

00:09:36.146 --> 00:09:36.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:36.645 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%
This is very true.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: I'm not
saying it's easy,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's the
information you need.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I started
my climb out of debt.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you
decided out of that space

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.767 align:middle line:90%
to become a mortgage broker.

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Well, no.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
By that time, I had given
up the brokerage business

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.687 align:middle line:84%
because the housing
market started to shift.

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: But
that's how I learned

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that I loved to teach because
in my mortgage business,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I had written this book, "What
Every Woman Needs to Know

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
About Getting a Mortgage," and I
was more interested in teaching

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
these women, because the
universal question was,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
when I said to them, how did
you fall into bankruptcy?

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Or, how did you
do this and that?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I got the same answer.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which was?

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Which
was either someone

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in their family got
sick, or they got sick.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Went through all
of their savings,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:90%
because they had not planned.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a 401(k).

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have proper
health insurance, all of that.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile they had
a million dollar house.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So as their life
started to shift,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what was
the other problem?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.428 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I've been
to all these brokers,

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
but no one explained to
me the mortgage process,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
because women, when
you bank speak,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.649 align:middle line:84%
women especially get this
glazed look in our eyes, right?

00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like too much.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And no one's paying attention.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Why is this person
not paying attention?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:90%
So I would say, OK.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So I used to run workshops
on Thursday evenings

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
at our company, and I would
teach these women what's

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
involved with
getting a mortgage.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with this
thing, "The Borrower's

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Bill of Rights."

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Because women were
so intimidated

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
when they would talk
about mortgages and all

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of the numbers
involved, they never

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
felt they were entitled
to ask the broker, so

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.804 align:middle line:84%
how much money are
you making on this?

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it was always the
men that were the brokers.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
The women were down here.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.095 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH] No.

00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:90%
You've got to come up here.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest asset
and the biggest liability.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you teach them
to ask the right questions

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
by explaining in really
easy terms what-- not easy,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
but take that time to
explain the terms, which--

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: But it is
easy, because everything

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
can be broken down
to three words.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
You really can.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything
in life, I think.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you make it
simple and digestible,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:90%
oh, they get-- oh, I get it.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Now I see what it's about.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They have to do
the work, though.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:90%
They have to want to ask it.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
able to use it when

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
they're talking to a broker.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's giving women
permission to really grow

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:90%
into their own space.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: What were
the three words?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.855 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: No, I
said everything can

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
be broken down into three words.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.226 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: I try
it all the time.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It gets on people's nerves.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mean just
simple, simple statements.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Really.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yeah.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Doesn't get
more simple than that.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.411 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So bankruptcy happens
because events and unforeseen

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
circumstances happen because
savings don't occur or 401(k)s

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:90%
How do you get to the savings?

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you consciously--
do you recommend

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
taking a percentage of
your paycheck or payment

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
and putting it away?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Is that something you--

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Absolutely.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a couple of things.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the illness.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember I had this
women on the phone,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.196 align:middle line:84%
and we had adjustable rates,
and we had fixed rates.

00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say to her,
you know what,

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
for how your income
is right now,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:90%
you can afford this fixed rate.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But in 36 months-- because
she was getting a 327--

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
it's going to shift
to a variable.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And if the market changes,
and then your mortgage payment

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.023 align:middle line:84%
goes up every
month, you won't be

00:13:03.023 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
able to afford it on
this current income.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
think the answer was?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
No, that's OK, because
Bob's getting a raise,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and I have all this
rationalization.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:90%
So that wasn't a health issue.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:90%
That was a lifestyle choice.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So by having the discipline
that you make your contribution

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to your savings or your
401(k) or whatever,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:84%
religiously, every
single paycheck,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.226 align:middle line:84%
matters, because
it's about respect.

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you recommend
women having their own savings

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
account independent
of their husband's,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.749 align:middle line:84%
or do recommend commingling
funds completely?

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Good question.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
People always ask me that.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that you have to
have a couple of accounts.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Your own, his own, and joint.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And out of the joint comes
your mortgage payment,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.619 align:middle line:84%
comes stuff that
you do together.

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And your own stuff
is your own stuff,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
because your husband's
going to go out and buy

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
this wacky $2,000
mountain bike, and you're

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
going to go out and spend
$1,000 on a pair of shoes.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So your own stuff
is without judgment

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
as long as you've taken
care of the stuff here.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But you bring up
but another point,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is that people need to talk
about money before they

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:90%
get married.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: The premarital chat.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does it.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.258 align:middle line:84%
No one likes to do
it, because they

00:14:15.258 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
think it kills the
romance, but guess what?

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
50% of divorce ends up
because of finances.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 50%.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's obviously
a conversation

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:90%
that's not happening.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.975 align:middle line:84%
So you suggest doing a little
bit for the-- woman's account,

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:84%
man's account separate, and
a joint account together

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.855 align:middle line:90%
that gets contributed to first.

00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yep.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that gets taken
care of first,

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and it takes care
of all the bills.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
left over individually,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.672 align:middle line:84%
then people can do their
own thing without judgment.

00:14:42.672 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Good advice.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.181 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:14:44.181 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.945 align:middle line:84%
So you also talk about two
different tracks of life.

00:14:47.945 --> 00:14:49.417 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: OK.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:90%
So I can't take claim to this.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I learned this from my therapist
many years ago, Deanna Olliker.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
She came up with this
concept that Darwin's theory

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of survival of the fittest works
in the jungle but also works

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
for people emotionally
and psychologically,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the concept being is that,
when you come out of the birth

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
canal, it was the most fabulous
hotel you'll ever be in .

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Around the clock food,
beverages, you name it.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.134 align:middle line:90%
Clean sheets, right?

00:15:20.134 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, nine months
later, the universe is going,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
let's go.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, no, I'm
not ready to come out yet.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.039 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So on one level, it's your first
experience of being abandoned.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:90%
You're losing that space.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:90%
You can never go back there.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.387 align:middle line:84%
So what happens as you start
to grow and kind of get--

00:15:40.387 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because kids are
smart, you know this,

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
the kids are smart before
they came out of the canal.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%
They're so evolved.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But they get a sense of
who and what and where,

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of
get their bearings.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can see
really quickly who's

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
going to take care
of them and who

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very
marginal and unavailable.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's really
important that when

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
babies are born that the mother
carries the baby, literally.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Sleeps with the baby--
because for nine months,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
the baby's been,
doo doo doo doo.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, that has to continue
as a transition, right?

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:90%
But most mothers don't do that.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, also, the
hospitals don't let you.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:84%
They take the baby right
away, and they test it,

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and they put it in an
incubator in modern hospitals.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
We actually had to fight
and sign all sorts of things

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.845 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep our
baby in our hands.

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:26.511 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Nice.

00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good for you.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.938 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, well,
it's because we

00:16:28.938 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
had help to make us aware
of something like that

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
through a doula, but I digress.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, it's true.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.825 align:middle line:84%
It's built in that way for
safety in American hospitals.

00:16:38.825 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: It's built
in there for liability.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: We're not going
down that conversation, right?

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so going
back to two tracks.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is who
you are authentically,

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
celebrated and supported,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.625 align:middle line:90%
you have to shift to survive.

00:16:56.625 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Because a three-year-old
can't make oatmeal, right?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So the kid learns really
early, if I do this,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:90%
I'll get my needs met.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it is about
survival, right?

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
If I do this, I'm going
to be abandoned again.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, when-- and by the
time you're five years old,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
your values and perceptions
and assumptions of the world

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:90%
are set.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile,
you're 25 years old,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're making decisions as
if-- because emotionally you're

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:90%
still five.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
gets people trapped,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
their authentic self
versus their adapted self.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're,
at 25 and 45 and 55,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
still thinking that our needs
are going to get met from--

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, we
make the wrong choices,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't learned
that it's OK to be authentic.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the path
we need to be on.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why we get
into so much debt.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's because our adapted self is
making all the wrong decisions.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
A five-year-old
can't drive a car,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
but meanwhile, we give
him permission to do that.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're making-- that
inauthentic self is making

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:84%
decisions based on the fact
that we're not good enough.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where it stems
from, you're saying.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: And
then we can't cope

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.757 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
trust ourselves.

00:18:08.757 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to take a
look here at a clip of Pegi

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
giving this lecture to a group
of people about these two

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.608 align:middle line:90%
different tracks.

00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Who wants to
talk about depression?

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to talk
about isolation?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.222 align:middle line:90%
Five.

00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:27.805 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to talk
about self sabotage?

00:18:27.805 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.279 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't explain
to you-- where is

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
this thing-- I didn't explain
to you that-- remember

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I said you have two
voices in my head?

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.677 align:middle line:84%
What I have in my
head and my life--

00:18:45.677 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I said to you my life was split.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd say to my therapist,
what's going on here?

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when you come
out of the birth canal,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
how everyone handles you--
your mother included--

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:84%
tells you how you're
going to survive.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to
children real early,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
they get the lay of
the land, and they

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:84%
see who they are authentically
is not acceptable.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
If they adapt and become
a different persona,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:90%
they will get their needs met.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like Darwin's
theory, survival of the jungle,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's really
about your emotions

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
and your psychological make up.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Those two drives are so
powerful, they run your life.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
You have people-- and I was
one of them-- when I was 58,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
it was finally like admitting
that I had these two tracks.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:90%
They weren't working.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't live in this
adapted world anymore.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.935 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have
yet one more job.

00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I had to be authentic.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And who you are authentically--
and we touched on this

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:84%
a little bit-- is
about being inside.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
My nana, oddly
enough, she was right.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Teaching would make me happy.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And it has.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:90%
But all of you have desires.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:84%
All of you have things that
you don't take care of.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And you can.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:90%
You have the power of choice.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to these
two tracks-- and you have it

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.066 align:middle line:84%
in your face every single moment
of the day with your mom--

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is you have to be a certain
way in order to survive.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
just doesn't fit.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it makes us angry.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you say to yourself,
what am I doing here?

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
You do it either in a
relationship or a job.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.731 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing these jeans
that were on sale.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I bought them.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.655 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, god,
they don't fit me.

00:20:25.655 --> 00:20:26.681 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
We all do these things.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So the point of it
is to acknowledge

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:90%
that you have these two tracks.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The sabotage comes
into play-- sabotage

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is like this little
five-year-old inside of you

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
who's constantly going to get in
your way because she's scared.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked
you all to identify

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.974 align:middle line:84%
what was in the threshold
of the doorway, right,

00:20:49.974 --> 00:20:52.015 align:middle line:84%
and you shared a little
bit of your insecurities,

00:20:52.015 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
right, it's all fear.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do
comes from fear.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And fear of what?

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
you've heard this.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Do not forget this.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to draw a red
box around this statement.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:90%
This is the coup de grace.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.479 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And some of you may not like
what you're going to hear,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's what I live by.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
My feeling and my theory is that
when you come out of the birth

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:84%
canal, it's a huge emotional
change and spiritual change

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
for a child.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of rejection
coming out of the womb.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You're leaving this
fantastic hotel.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:90%
God says, oop, time to go.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, again, the
mother in those nine months

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
has to do certain things for the
child to make them feel safe.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But most of us, and
I swear to god I

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
think-- I know it's,
like, 99% of all of us--

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.351 align:middle line:84%
is that that life
doesn't really happen,

00:21:48.351 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot going
on, especially if you have

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
siblings, especially a
lot of stuff in the house.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, our
needs get pushed aside.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And our needs at those ages
are who we are authentically.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, the child wants warmth,
closeness, and acceptance.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, if no one is giving that
to the child who deserves it

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
appropriately,
guess what happens?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The child gets a message
of I'm not good enough--

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that's where shame comes from--
and the sabotage gets played

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:84%
out is that as
you get older, you

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
have this concrete
slab of monsters.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So if I go to be successful,
or if I go to do this,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
I might get abandoned again.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Should I say it again?

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
This is-- This is,
like, powerful.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we talked a little
before that clip about children

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and how to have a conversation
with children about money.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.649 align:middle line:84%
And if they're-- maybe
50, 60 years ago,

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the conversation never happened
around the dinner table about

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
money, so children grew up to
be adults these days not knowing

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:84%
or not having a lot of
knowledge around money.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, modern families are
having too much conversation

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
around the dinner
table about money.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we've swung the
opposite direction.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Where do you-- where's the
middle of the road here?

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you educate children
early on about finances?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, first of
all, it's really before that,

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
about the money.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:90%
It's about respect.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you treat your
child with respect,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
demand it back
from them, then you

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:84%
have a very different kind
of learning environment.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And the way to talk about money
with your children, again,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
you need to be comfortable,
because kids are sensitive.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll pick up any
vibe from anywhere.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.753 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: So the
key for you is to be

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with the money.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you don't have
enough for whatever.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying to the
child, Daddy didn't bring home

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
a paycheck or something
terribly negative that

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
makes a child
uncomfortable, you have

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to be very calm-- literally
calm-- and go, you know what?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we can
really do that this week.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this, this instead.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So that tone, that sense
that I have control,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
gets transmitted to the child,
so they don't focus on it.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you deviate, and
you do something, like, odd,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
the kid's going to go, uh
oh, something's going on.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
get distracted by.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So staying consistent
and in control is the key.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.795 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: And calm because
you have to always portray

00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to your child that you
will take care of them.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if there's a
financial scarcity conversation

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
happening around the dinner
table or in the household,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that threatens the child's
safety in the world?

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
You told me this before, right?

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.386 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yeah.

00:24:33.386 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Because their perception is
that this thing is gonna--

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
this disaster is
going to happen,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to it's
the way you frame it.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the way you set
it up for the child.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So even if there is
financial difficulty happening

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
in the household, to
frame it to the children,

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
basically say we're
making different decisions

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
with our money
right now, or we're

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
choosing to do something
different right now.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.086 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yeah.

00:24:59.086 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's a huge one.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
lost their houses.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
that to a child?

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you act shamed by it,
and you have all these emotions

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that you keep dragging and
presenting to your child,

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
regardless of their
age, it's going

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
to make them really
uncomfortable, as

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.884 align:middle line:84%
opposed to dinner
time conversation,

00:25:19.884 --> 00:25:21.175 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about this.

00:25:21.175 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happened.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
forward with this.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.795 align:middle line:90%
Be the captain of the ship.

00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So obviously
the child's moved

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:84%
from maybe a house
to an apartment,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and they see what's
happening in the household.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And you just simply say,
this is what happened.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Daddy lost his job.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
We had to move to another house.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stay
calm about this.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.139 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make
things happen this way

00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and still try to maintain
some type of consistency,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
like, at least dinner three
days a week or something, right?

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.716 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Absolutely.

00:25:47.716 --> 00:25:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And to make it fun.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.875 align:middle line:90%
You know, kids--

00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Listen, what does
everybody want?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants warmth,
closeness, and acceptance,

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to be
engaged, even my cat.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Every specie needs to connect.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you have an
issue that's challenging

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
for a family, what
do you got to do?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You got to connect
and stay connected,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.619 align:middle line:84%
not this thing, the
opposite of this.

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But those three
things you just mentioned

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.224 align:middle line:84%
don't cost anything-- warmth,
closeness, and connection.

00:26:15.224 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Acceptance.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Acceptance.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Warmth, acceptance,
and connection?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Warmth,
closeness, and acceptance.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Susan Piver taught me this.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just so profound.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a funny
passage in her book,

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, wow, that is
absolutely the essence-- right,

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:90%
three words?

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the essence of everything.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.722 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:35.722 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
No, that's true, and those
things don't cost anything.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
everything from the wagon wheel

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.555 align:middle line:84%
concept that you have--
and we have a graphic

00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
here of what this
is-- what do you

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
teach with this tool
of the wagon wheel?

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Everything in life
is related to something else.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The core of the wagon
wheel is cracked.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's your self esteem.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So if your self
esteem is cracked,

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
all of those different parts
of that wheel-- the wheel's

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:90%
going to wobble.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you get it
cemented back and repair

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.247 align:middle line:84%
someone's self esteem, the
wheel will move smoothly.

00:27:10.247 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
don't see the connection

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:84%
between their closet where
they can't find anything,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
their refrigerator
where the outdated food

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is pushed all the way
in the back and they

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
can't see anything, to their
behavior at their office.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
They can't see any
connection to anything.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.177 align:middle line:84%
But when people, again,
don't operate out

00:27:29.177 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
of respect-- that's where
everything starts-- then

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
everything is a mess, and
everything is slightly chaotic.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in this
image here, you've

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
got the cracked self
esteem in the beginning.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to have
the center hub be complete,

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
then that means everything
else would fall into place.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So it would be career, finances,
pets, spiritual, children, fun,

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
health, friends,
siblings, and partner.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.044 align:middle line:84%
So it's all basically
related to the self esteem?

00:27:58.044 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You ever
hear the expression,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
how you do one thing is
how you do everything?

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: That's it.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going
to have someone

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
that has a meticulous
car and then

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:84%
go home and find their
medicine cabinet a mess.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't have that
contradiction with someone.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.534 align:middle line:84%
You have other kinds
of contradictions,

00:28:14.534 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:84%
but the point of it is that
how you relate to yourself, how

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
you feel about yourself,
gets transmitted

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.775 align:middle line:84%
to your environment, to all
of the people in your life,

00:28:23.775 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to the way you talk to a
waitress in a restaurant.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I once listened to
a lecture from Lisa Nichols,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and she said, if you
show me a person's trunk,

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.034 align:middle line:84%
then I can show
you their finances.

00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:38.367 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Oh, that's brilliant.

00:28:38.367 --> 00:28:39.241 align:middle line:90%
Good for her.

00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I thought that
was really interesting.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So if your trunk is a mess--
think about your trunk

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Is it organized?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.616 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: I have
a station wagon,

00:28:46.616 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm proud to say
it's quite organized.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.722 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: But it's
not fastidious.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It needs to get washed,
but I have it organized.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You do
have it organized.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I've got various
things in my trunk.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not a mess,
but there's probably

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
five or six things
that are out of order,

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and that would probably
explain my finances.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I have five or six
things going on.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:84%
They're fine, but they're
a little bit out of order.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.971 align:middle line:90%
It's just a game to play.

00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.384 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about the roadmap.

00:29:15.384 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Ooh, the roadmap.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I love the roadmap.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The roadmap-- I call
it the holy grail,

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
because when you have
to implement something--

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.630 align:middle line:90%
this is the key.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.635 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is great.

00:29:27.635 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing with it?

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You better do something
with it, or you're just

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
supporting the edge
of the table, right?

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So the key to healing
is, first of all,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:90%
keeping your self commitments.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Second, from keeping your self
commitments comes self respect.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Remember
earlier on, I said to you,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's because
people don't trust.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: So in order for
you to really trust yourself,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
respect for yourself.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us some
examples of this?

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because those are big words, and
they've been used very often.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
What are some really
concrete examples

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
of how self commitment
relates to self respect?

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Oh, it's here.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's show the third
tool, the respect-o-meter.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
The respect-o-meter--
because you have control,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:90%
you have power.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
How you choose to use it is
how people get into trouble.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose
the respect-o-meter,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.160 align:middle line:84%
this moment is your
threshold of time,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
because you're in the present.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you, I'm committing
myself to go on a diet.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
No sugar, no
chocolate, all of that.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm hungry.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I can have an apple, or
I can have a hamburger.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to be?

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.089 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Apple.

00:30:42.089 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right, or hamburger?

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So the respect-o-meter--
excuse me--

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
makes you accountable
for your actions

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:84%
so that if you pick a
hamburger, before you pick it,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.662 align:middle line:84%
you say to yourself, so
how much respect are you

00:30:54.662 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
going have for yourself
if you eat the burger?

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.799 align:middle line:90%
Well, not a whole lot.

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
How much are you going to
have when you have the apple?

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to love you more.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:02.954 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:31:02.954 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to be today?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll have the apple.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So every decision
can be made from that.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.228 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Every
conflict needs to have--

00:31:10.228 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
you need to superimpose
that over it,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.567 align:middle line:90%
because then you have power.

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
actually a great point.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
taking care of yourself

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
or choosing the right
relationship or business

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.010 align:middle line:84%
partner or anything, if you
can check it against your self

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
commitment and
self respect-- now,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
there's another part to the
holy grail here-- self trust

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.805 align:middle line:90%
and self love.

00:31:31.805 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Ooh.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.929 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you
hear the expression

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that trust is the cornerstone
of a good relationship.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:90%
But how do you get there?

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.742 align:middle line:84%
How you build trust with your--
and it could be your partner.

00:31:44.742 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It could be your child.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an investment, and
you have to be honest.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:90%
You have to be accountable.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Takes time.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: How many people say
one thing and do the opposite?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.985 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't breed trust.

00:31:57.985 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it breeds the opposite.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking
about mothers before.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I had this-- this
doctor one time,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.388 align:middle line:84%
and she was complaining
to me about her--

00:32:06.388 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
about her child
lies all the time.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:90%
He was, like, 14.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
you set this up.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But he thinks the only
way he can get he wants

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.520 align:middle line:84%
or get what he thinks he
needs is by lying to you.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Because in her early
years with him,

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that's how she appeared to
him, because she did not

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.622 align:middle line:90%
develop the honesty.

00:32:24.622 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because here's a key--
and you have a daughter.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:90%
You understand this.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
When you say your
child, I don't want

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
you to have sugar-- and that's a
hard thing with kids in school,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's
eating cupcakes, right?

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But when your child says to you,
Mommy, I had a cupcake today

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and tells you, and you
don't punish them-- see,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
the catch is, kids don't
tell the truth because they

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
think they're going
to get punished.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, it starts
way back here when

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you tell your child
not to do something.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the proof
is-- the consistency

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:90%
is that you never punish them.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You just want the
information, because the child

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.760 align:middle line:90%
feels badly enough.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.472 align:middle line:90%
Coming to you is huge.

00:33:00.472 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got to hold on to that,
because especially when they

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
start going through
those teen years,

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
it is really challenging.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.752 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Trust is established
very early on with children.

00:33:09.752 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Even when they tell you a
secret, and if you go ahead

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.751 align:middle line:84%
and tell someone else,
the trust is broken.

00:33:13.751 --> 00:33:15.969 align:middle line:84%
It could be through any
type of realm of trust.

00:33:15.969 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, yeah,
but here is actually

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:90%
where trust really starts.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Trust starts when you
come out of the womb,

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:84%
because when the mother
is carrying the child,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:90%
she can anticipate the needs.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the bonding stage,
the trusting stage,

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that is critical for a child.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But let's say circumstances
aren't allowable.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you adopt a child,
you get your child at 3.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
If the mother sets up that kind
of way that they communicate

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
it will never fail.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.151 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as someone
deviates and starts to punish,

00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:48.525 align:middle line:84%
then the lying is
going to start.

00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't punish them.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
You want them to--
you constantly

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:90%
want them to do this with you.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And be able to say to
them, so, how do you feel?

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:90%
The kid goes, I feel great.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.431 align:middle line:90%
I had the cupcake.

00:33:59.431 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:00.429 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:01.829 align:middle line:90%
But try better next time.

00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:02.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something like that.

00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So what you could do-- and it's
interesting that we're talking

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:84%
about parenting advice when
we're actually talking about

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:84%
money, because the name of
the book is "It's Never About

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.880 align:middle line:90%
the Money ..Even When It Is."

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So even if the trust has
been broken early on, which

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.133 align:middle line:84%
is very, very possible and
very likely, so for all us

00:34:23.133 --> 00:34:24.561 align:middle line:90%
that happened to--

00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You mean
most of America?

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Most of the world?

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can start
and establish the trust now,

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:90%
even if you have an adult child.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You can start, or you can
parent yourself and start

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.340 align:middle line:84%
with yourself to develop
trust, which goes back

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.206 align:middle line:84%
to the roadmap, the holy
grail roadmap, where you say,

00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
this is how to establish
trust with yourself,

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.219 align:middle line:84%
financially,
relationship, anything.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You start with self
commitment, and then you

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.417 align:middle line:84%
trust yourself
into self respect.

00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: No.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:84%
It's self commitment,
respect, then trust.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:90%
You can't leap frog this.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Then it's love.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it has
to go in order.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You have
to go in order.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Self respect--
I mean self commitment,

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:84%
respect, then trust, and
then ultimately love.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, this could
actually really heal

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.647 align:middle line:84%
somebody's financial
situation, right?

00:35:10.647 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, yeah, because--
remember the part in the book

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:18.140 align:middle line:84%
where you have the redcoats,
and the redcoats are in line,

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's the way
they used to fight?

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
In the Civil War, they
all lined up, right?

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the healing process
is like-- it's almost

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.459 align:middle line:90%
like dominoes.

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have the redcoats--
I have all these metaphors--

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the redcoat steps
out because he's

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:84%
healed this issue
about whatever.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:90%
All of them move forward.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
So he steps out again.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:90%
They all move forward.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to work on this

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and then put the
same amount of effort

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:84%
into this guy, this
guy, and that guy.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
No, they all flow
very gracefully.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start to
shift, they all go together.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
reassuring concept

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that if you can
build self respect--

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I have a client, and she said
to me a couple of weeks ago,

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
she says, you know-- because
we send our invoices out--

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.170 align:middle line:84%
she said, this month, I paid you
from my own checking account.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't put it
on a credit card.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.510 align:middle line:90%
That was huge, right?

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:84%
These little, tiny
victories that people have,

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
it then spills into
this and into that.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.575 align:middle line:84%
Because as she's telling
more stories about her week

00:36:18.575 --> 00:36:21.697 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, it starts
to pop up like poppies.

00:36:21.697 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, god, did you see this?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.738 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:36:23.738 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:90%
It's connected to this.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So people see their progress
if they follow the formula.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And it never fails.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.127 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're a
financial whisperer.

00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: What does that mean?

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.011 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You know, it's
funny, because I rarely ever

00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:84%
have to talk about
money, because it's not

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.426 align:middle line:90%
about the money.

00:36:40.426 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really about the behaviors.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:47.134 align:middle line:84%
It's the disconnection between
our feelings and our behaviors.

00:36:47.134 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what I get people to look
at, because it's about control.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Remember I said three words?

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:90%
It's about control.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Somebody-- listen to
me-- somebody has it.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Somebody needs it.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:90%
How do you get it?

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have-- because
at the end of the day,

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
someone has to have,
and it better be you.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Or else something
else has it over you.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what you
do winds up being

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.770 align:middle line:84%
more psychotherapy
than anything.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But your background
is in finances?

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, you see,
that's not-- not exactly.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.495 align:middle line:84%
If you look at my-- if
you look at my history,

00:37:23.495 --> 00:37:26.115 align:middle line:84%
I have a-- I was the
serial entrepreneur,

00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
owning-- you know, building
a restaurant in New York,

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:90%
being a contractor out here.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I had tons of jobs.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what it really was
about is not knowing who I was

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
please other people.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So everything was always
about making money.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about making me happy.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It was a certain
lifestyle, which

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I think most people ascribe to.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't get a chance
until something happens

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to take a step back and
go, what do I really want?

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.320 align:middle line:90%
What really gives my life value?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
my purpose here?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't find that
until my life fell apart.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:84%
See, there was a value--
there was a purpose to that.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so when it
fell apart, you rebuilt it,

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you built in these
tools in order to rebuild it.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, the tools--
everyone is creative.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we take that
away from ourselves,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:90%
we diminish ourselves.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.885 align:middle line:84%
So in solving my
own personal stuff,

00:38:15.885 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I was always able to find the
three words, and it's like,

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on here?

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate-- why is
my second favorite word--

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and I would be able to
identify it and then

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:84%
be able to expand on it
and make a tool out of it.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.392 align:middle line:84%
Because I do it my--
I use it myself.

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:84%
If it's good enough for me,
it's good enough for you,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.830 align:middle line:90%
good for you.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Because it works.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
reinvent the wheel.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.947 align:middle line:84%
So just keep it simple,
but be honest about it.

00:38:42.947 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's another tool
that you have, which is great,

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.905 align:middle line:90%
the respect-o-meter.

00:38:46.905 --> 00:38:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yes.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is great, because
it helps with every decision

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that you need to make it.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.243 align:middle line:84%
So you can wager
every decision you

00:38:53.243 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:84%
need to make against your
little respect-o-meter.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.137 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:38:58.137 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: OK.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So you are in the
moment of choice.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you have to
honor your self commitment.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
This is not commitment to bring
a birthday cake to the event.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:84%
This is you've committed
yourself to drink more water,

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
floss your teeth, get more
exercise, stop eating sugar.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.648 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:39:17.648 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Spend more time with your kids.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So here comes this opportunity,
and you could-- life

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:90%
is always one or the other.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.570 align:middle line:90%
You go left or you go right.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have an opportunity to
keep the commitment or not.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
keep the commitment,

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.610 align:middle line:90%
it's about a loss of respect.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
respect, you're

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:84%
pushing away the
time that you're

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:84%
going to start
trusting yourself.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get
to the trust window

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you can because
that is-- that, right after, is

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
followed by love, and
who doesn't want love?

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're looking
at the pair of black shoes

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
at the store, and you have five
more pairs of black shoes--

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:84%
pumps, specifically--
in the closet,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.361 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: OK.

00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Am I looking
in your closet?

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's pretty much
many women's closet.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
that pair of black shoes.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
At what point do you say,
brain, you have five.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Walk away from the shoes.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: No, no, no.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I personally would not say that.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I would say to myself,
do you need this?

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'd go, no.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you want this?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I want it real badly.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.622 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:29.622 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Did you make your
mortgage payment?

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd go through the list
that need to get paid.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right there
in front of the shoes.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: In my mind.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Right then and there.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So how much money is left
over from all of that?

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.237 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, uh, I'll
do some calculations,

00:40:41.237 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:90%
like, you know what?

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's give the
salesperson your card.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell her you want that.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
When it goes on sale,
have her call you.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, you'll
postpone it for the future.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens if
the shoes disappear?

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, honey, the shoes
weren't meant for you.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to abide by that.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's take it to the
next level-- a house.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So many people got
into housing situations

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.950 align:middle line:90%
that they could never afford.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And the banks allowed that.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But it was also getting
into those situations

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.230 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:90%
How do we go after that?

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The dream or up levelling your
life and get somebody who can

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:84%
really take a look at
your finances-- yourself,

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
specifically-- and say,
I cannot afford this,

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:90%
or I can afford this.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Does that come from the same
way of doing your finances?

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Really getting a
clear picture of it?

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: But
everything is about that.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.404 align:middle line:90%
Food's the same way.

00:41:35.404 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Should you have sugar?

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Should you have soda?

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- the key is to
live a life of accountability.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Live a clean life.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Be healthy.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.734 align:middle line:84%
What's the most precious
thing you have is your health.

00:41:49.734 --> 00:41:50.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is true.

00:41:50.525 --> 00:41:51.272 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:51.272 --> 00:41:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: So people
take it for granted.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They take so many
things for granted.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do that,
because all you have is this.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.185 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
take care of this,

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
but meanwhile you're
trying to tell--

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.855 align:middle line:84%
I use this classic, telling
someone else what to do--

00:42:07.855 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:90%
meanwhile, you can't do it.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's also
we look for experts

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves, because
they have more experience.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
trying to climb out

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.930 align:middle line:84%
of a financial
situation, as you say,

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:84%
or when you have a
lack of knowledge

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:84%
around a certain area,
you go to dietitians,

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:30.572 align:middle line:84%
or you seek out nutritional
experts or books or Gaiam TV

00:42:30.572 --> 00:42:32.780 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is in order
to be able to get yourself

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But those are investments,
like you had with the coach.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:90%
So how do you wager that?

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:84%
When you were in that
situation, you were in debt,

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.270 align:middle line:84%
but yet you spent
money on a coach.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.156 align:middle line:90%
Why did you decide to do that?

00:42:45.156 --> 00:42:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
first of all, it

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.055 align:middle line:84%
wasn't buying another
pair of shoes.

00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't something frivolous.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.370 align:middle line:84%
People have to
know the difference

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:84%
between if something
makes sense.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So then we're coming into a
whole category of instinct

00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:90%
and fear and stuff like that.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
I thought it made sense,

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:90%
because I needed a ladder.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I needed a tool.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I needed a shovel.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I needed something to
give me more information,

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:84%
because reading
only went so far.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
learned when I read,

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the artist's way
is I was entitled.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Then now what do I do with it?

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.325 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked a couple
people for a recommendation

00:43:19.325 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:84%
on a career coach, and I
interviewed some of them,

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
it became, then,
really clear to me

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that this was the path,
because it felt right.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Your instincts
are your identity.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Your feelings are your identity.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And I had had enough therapy.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I had enough knowledge
to feel, you know what?

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I think this makes sense.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
coup de grace test.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.860 align:middle line:84%
If I turned around and said
it to family members who

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:84%
operate very differently than
I do, what would they say?

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, that makes sense.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Shoes, no.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Career coach, yeah.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:53.853 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
a great litmus test.

00:43:53.853 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Providing it's the
right person to ask.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.441 align:middle line:90%
You can't ask the wrong person.

00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:01.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask the person
who really is grounded and not

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.769 align:middle line:90%
full of a lot of--

00:44:02.769 --> 00:44:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not the person
you learned it from.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Right.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.118 align:middle line:84%
Or it doesn't have to be a
family member, but someone

00:44:07.118 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
who you trust, who has
your best interest at heart

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say,
does this make sense?

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And weight in.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, as a
financial whisper,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:90%
you have done this for how long?

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.385 align:middle line:84%
How long have you been
coaching people around this?

00:44:21.385 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: I started this
business seven years ago.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.215 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
biggest complaint

00:44:26.215 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:90%
that people come to you with?

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Being unhappy.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Being out of control.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not about how
much money they make.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It's that they can't
manage their money,

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and they have-- it's
almost like-- let's say

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a client that makes
$150,000 or $200,000 a year.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:90%
She still has so much debt.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like she's living
almost paycheck to paycheck.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And she knows something's wrong.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.687 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't really know
how to get a grip on it.

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's what you
mean by out of control,

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that loop right there, where you
are-- one thing is happening,

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
yet it's inauthentic
with yourself.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Because
it doesn't feel OK.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.275 align:middle line:84%
And again, your
feelings are everything.

00:45:03.275 --> 00:45:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have
you really helped

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.227 align:middle line:84%
someone who's been $200,000
in debt reduce their debt?

00:45:09.227 --> 00:45:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Oh, yeah.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By becoming
authentic with themselves.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.456 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
here's the thing.

00:45:13.456 --> 00:45:14.620 align:middle line:90%
I had a-- yes.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I had one of my clients many,
many years ago came to me

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:84%
because she had a fear
of public speaking.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So for her, that's the
problem she wanted to solve.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not a speak-- I
don't teach public speaking.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It' just not what I do.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But she came
recommended by somebody.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we sat, we were then
able to dissect and then see

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.080 align:middle line:84%
her money and see
the disconnection

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and see how she was
spending when she was upset

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and how all those other pieces--
but her fear of public speaking

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.420 align:middle line:84%
really came from her
fear of being unworthy.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She had an older brother
that her mother fussed over,

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.430 align:middle line:90%
and everything was about him.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.049 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was about her except
where she went to law school,

00:45:54.049 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:84%
where she did her
undergraduate work.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The pressure on
her was staggering.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder she had feelings
of no matter what I do,

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough, right?

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And she was president of
a very well known company,

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of visibility
in California.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But she had, like, the secret,
the shame, that every time she

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
had to get up and speak,
it's like, she almost

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.285 align:middle line:90%
had take a Xanax.

00:46:16.285 --> 00:46:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Or she did take a Xanax.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And she just couldn't
manage with it,

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and she was embarrassed,
and she had shame about it.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to
navigate through it.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not a story
about money, per se,

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:84%
but money played a
part in it in terms

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.730 align:middle line:84%
of how she would express
her angst, her nervousness.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:90%
She'd go shopping.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.309 align:middle line:90%
Which worsened the situation.

00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
she could afford it,

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:84%
but then when I sent someone
to refinance her house when

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the business--
but when you looked

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:84%
at her financials, it's like,
well, this doesn't make sense.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You're making all this
money, and meanwhile, you

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
have huge credit card
expenses for what?

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.350 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.480 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to
spend all this money

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:84%
for on this stuff when you
already had a Mercedes.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.673 align:middle line:90%
You have this.

00:46:58.673 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:90%
You have that.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It should be going
into your 401(k).

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It should go into a
different retirement fund.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So to get her to kind of relook
at everything and get control.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.080 align:middle line:84%
That's always the
key is get control.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we talked
a lot about debt.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about breaking

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:84%
through a financial glass
ceiling, if you will,

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or up leveling to the
next financial bracket

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.890 align:middle line:90%
if that's what one desires.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
How do you get through
the programming

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.560 align:middle line:84%
from the family or the
lifestyle that you're

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.090 align:middle line:84%
accustomed to into
that next level,

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.350 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you desire,
so that you could either

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:84%
fund a 401(k), create a savings,
put children through college,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.635 align:middle line:84%
donate back, build
a forest, whatever

00:47:40.635 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:90%
it is that you want to do?

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, first of all,
what is the thing the person

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.180 align:middle line:90%
wants to accomplish?

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the
disconnect of, again,

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.720 align:middle line:84%
feeling you're not
worthy to do it,

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.310 align:middle line:84%
because you have to put
yourself in a certain space.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to
do the work to change it.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.392 align:middle line:84%
So by glass ceiling,
I'm assuming

00:47:59.392 --> 00:48:01.350 align:middle line:84%
you don't mean the
corporate, traditional glass

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.240 align:middle line:84%
ceiling of how do you get
ahead in the company, right?

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.153 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
your personal stuff.

00:48:06.153 --> 00:48:06.864 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:48:06.864 --> 00:48:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Again, it goes
back to keep a commitment.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've decided
that you want to do whatever--

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a big
believer in student loans,

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:84%
because some of the programs
are really from cradle to grave.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Yeah.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:20.980 align:middle line:90%
They get you early on.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.480 align:middle line:84%
They give you all
these loans so you

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.660 align:middle line:84%
can put your child
into private school,

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and then it takes
off from there,

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.565 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to when you decide
that you want to have children,

00:48:32.565 --> 00:48:35.169 align:middle line:84%
create a family, and you
project the expenses.

00:48:35.169 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you want your child
to go to private school.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are you
going to afford that?

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of borrowing
money at that early stage

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:90%
is crazy.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got to start
putting stuff aside for it.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got to start
making some sacrifices.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Change your lifestyle.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I had two producers
that came to me.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Both BMW's, were incredibly high
lifestyle, trips, you name it.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were miserable
with each other, and they

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.040 align:middle line:84%
just-- they couldn't
get out of debt.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
change your lifestyle.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Get a Volkswagen, not an Audi.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Get this.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Get that.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
we can't do that.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.828 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, because
they've allowed those things

00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:13.932 align:middle line:90%
to define how they feel.

00:49:13.932 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:90%
That makes them feel better.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we do tend
to identify ourselves

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:84%
through our net worth in
certain countries, specifically

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.410 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, say,
specifically men seem

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to have that pressure that,
if they lose their job,

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
they seem to lose
their personal worth.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you unentangle your net
worth from your self worth?

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:42.130 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You have
to be grounded.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the key to everything.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
the vocabulary,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're in touch with
the feeling of what it means

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:84%
or how it makes you feel to
spend $2,000 on a mountain

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.660 align:middle line:84%
bike, and why do
you have to do that?

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.230 align:middle line:84%
If someone can identify
and be honest about it with

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:84%
themselves-- as most
people don't want to do--

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.221 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're talking
to the wrong person,

00:50:04.221 --> 00:50:06.790 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a mountain biker,
and I know what a $2,000

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
mountain bike could
have-- bottom line is,

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.984 align:middle line:90%
you've got to choose your--

00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Well, yeah.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.775 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:50:12.775 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:84%
If you've got to--
if it's a must

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.884 align:middle line:84%
have, then you have
to treat it like when

00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.550 align:middle line:84%
you try to teach your
child about saving

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.350 align:middle line:90%
to buy their first car.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:22.280 align:middle line:90%
You have to earn it.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.488 align:middle line:90%
You have to earn the respect.

00:50:23.488 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to do the
groundwork for it.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But when people start--
obviouly, it's just not men.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
When you start identifying
yourself and valuing yourself

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.157 align:middle line:84%
through something external,
you're in big trouble.

00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you would only
need a $2,000 mountain bike

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.460 align:middle line:84%
once every 10 to 12
years, so that's OK,

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:90%
you could budget for it.

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Good to know.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you mentioned
about budgeting for something.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So we do tend to live close
to-- year out, our goals, maybe,

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.040 align:middle line:84%
could be a couple
of months away,

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.530 align:middle line:84%
especially how quickly
things are moving these days.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.810 align:middle line:84%
When you set a goal three to
five years into the future,

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.470 align:middle line:84%
do you recommend
people doing that?

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Listen.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Anything that makes sense that
keeps you focused, I support.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Having a plan, especially
when you have a family,

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.950 align:middle line:84%
makes sense, because
then-- remember

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:84%
earlier I was saying
to you how you feel?

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.797 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel
calm all the time.

00:51:18.797 --> 00:51:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to
feel calm all the time

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.980 align:middle line:84%
if you've identified the
stuff that's coming up

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and you know how you're going
to cover it or not cover it.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.947 align:middle line:84%
But having the information
gives you power.

00:51:28.947 --> 00:51:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
something before that

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:84%
was really interesting about do
I want this, or do I need this?

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.709 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good barometer there.

00:51:36.709 --> 00:51:38.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you distinguish
the difference

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.190 align:middle line:90%
between want and need?

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Oh, OK.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So I need to
contribute to my 401(k)

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's part
of my life goal.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.275 align:middle line:90%
I want the jacket.

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:52.900 align:middle line:84%
What's going to help
me sleep at night,

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.531 align:middle line:84%
my 401(k) or this
fabulous jacket?

00:51:55.531 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how often do you
contribute to the 401(k)?

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.947 align:middle line:90%
How often do you suggest?

00:51:58.947 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well,
everyone's different.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:90%
You could be every paycheck.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.688 align:middle line:84%
That's usually the
easiest thing and have

00:52:03.688 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:90%
them take it automatically.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or every quarter or
whatever your situation is.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.929 align:middle line:84%
So that has to happen
before-- and you

00:52:10.929 --> 00:52:11.970 align:middle line:90%
could be an entrepreneur.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You could be--
this could actually

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:84%
be done for you if
you're an employee.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But that needs to be done before
the extra things that you buy.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Well, yeah,
because, again, it's

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.714 align:middle line:90%
keeping your commitment.

00:52:26.714 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot more respect
for yourself when you've

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.250 align:middle line:84%
said no to different
things-- doesn't matter

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:84%
what it is-- than you have
if you constantly give in,

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're permissive with
yourself or with your child.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There's no positive
outcome to that.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So keeping calm around
financial crisis is important.

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.145 align:middle line:84%
Making good choices
that are true

00:52:46.145 --> 00:52:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and authentic to yourself,
to be able to plan ahead

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and not be so impulsive.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Realize that your
self worth is more

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.530 align:middle line:84%
important than your net worth,
which is also a huge key here.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things is why
it's not all about the money,

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:90%
even when it is.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Well said.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.975 align:middle line:90%
I read that book.

00:53:05.975 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: You
did your homework.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.734 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:53:08.734 --> 00:53:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is there anything
that we haven't covered here?

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Sabotage.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sabotage.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Great, great point.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Self
sabotage is rampant,

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and people don't realize that's
really what they're doing.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
respect-o-meter,

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and you've already
lost the five pounds,

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and here comes that
fabulous greasy burger.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.269 align:middle line:90%
That's sabotage.

00:53:31.269 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Your little one that
sits on your shoulder,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.480 align:middle line:84%
your five-year-old-- remember
before I said to you, hey,

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.771 align:middle line:90%
who has the keys to the car?

00:53:36.771 --> 00:53:38.270 align:middle line:84%
If you let her have
keys to the car,

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
crash into the wall.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's sabotage.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You turn in the poor
report to your boss,

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.621 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's full
of holes, but you're

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:47.080 align:middle line:84%
angry at him, gee, who's
going to suffer here?

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:90%
You or your boss?

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be you.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:51.319 align:middle line:84%
People's perception
of you matters.

00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:53.110 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to rise
the corporate ladder.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You better have
your act together.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.010 align:middle line:84%
If your car's dirty, or you've
got a run in your stocking,

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and you walk into the
office, your hair is wet,

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like, it doesn't give
a good impression of how

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.940 align:middle line:90%
professional you are.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:09.081 align:middle line:84%
So all those tiny things reflect
how we feel about ourselves.

00:54:09.081 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So how, though, do you
stop the self sabotage?

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You gave us a lot of examples of
how people sabotage themselves,

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.660 align:middle line:90%
but how do you stop it?

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: Here's
how you stop it.

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember before I said to you,
your feelings are everything?

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Your feelings are your identity?

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.735 align:middle line:84%
So you have to-- when
you feel [GRUMBLING]--

00:54:27.735 --> 00:54:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I Stole this from
Homeland Security.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Blue, yellow, orange, red.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:90%
So everyone's hunky dory, blue.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's having
the party hats on.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Something shifts,
and you can see

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
this in your
three-month-old baby.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Something, the energy
in the room shifts.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
blue goes into yellow.

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the shifting.

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the
same thing with us.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.670 align:middle line:84%
If we feel ourselves shifting,
the most important thing we do

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.836 align:middle line:90%
is get all the troops together.

00:55:00.836 --> 00:55:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Get them all in your
living room in your head

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, what's
going on here?

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:05.964 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is going on.

00:55:05.964 --> 00:55:06.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel this and that.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's address it.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And this happens-- bam, bam,
bam-- in the split of a minute.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:17.520 align:middle line:84%
If you identify what it's
about and then identify

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.760 align:middle line:84%
the source of it, it
gives you information.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The key to self
sabotage is you've

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.990 align:middle line:90%
got to identify her feelings.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing that children need

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:31.142 align:middle line:84%
is your presence
and your patience.

00:55:31.142 --> 00:55:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can do
that with ourselves.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Exactly.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.158 align:middle line:84%
You take your little
five-year-old.

00:55:35.158 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:90%
You put her in your lap.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:39.094 align:middle line:84%
You put your arms around her,
and you rock her, and you say,

00:55:39.094 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And she'll tell you.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to use self
sabotage on your commitments,

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.241 align:middle line:84%
because that's
when it comes out.

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.864 align:middle line:84%
>>BURDICK: If you've
committed yourself

00:55:47.864 --> 00:55:50.614 align:middle line:84%
to walk every day for 30
minutes, and now you get up,

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, I'm
not doing this,

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and you start arguing
with yourself,

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.295 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know how to get
past it, you'll stay in bed,

00:55:56.295 --> 00:55:56.920 align:middle line:90%
and guess what?

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You won't feel great
about yourself.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So the key with sabotage is
to acknowledge it, embrace it,

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:05.670 align:middle line:84%
hold on to it, feel
it to breathe with it,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:06.880 align:middle line:90%
and then move on.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And stay calm.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.330 align:middle line:84%
This is all great advice,
especially for anyone

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.867 align:middle line:84%
dealing with
financial situations,

00:56:13.867 --> 00:56:15.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to climb that
corporate ladder,

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.240 align:middle line:84%
or getting ahead in
terms of savings.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.385 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for joining me.

00:56:20.385 --> 00:56:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Great advice.

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BURDICK: Thank you.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:22.280 align:middle line:90%
It was my pleasure.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fun stuff.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.780 align:middle line:84%
