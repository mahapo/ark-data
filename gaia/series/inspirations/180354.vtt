00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Ponder
this question.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the most
difficult things that have ever

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:84%
happened to us were the
greatest opportunities we've

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
been given to grow and evolve?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
That is the biggest question my
guest, spiritual teacher Matt

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Kahn, asked himself,
only to help him discover

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
love is really the only answer.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I am Lisa Garr, and
joining me is Matt Kahn.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
He's a spiritual teacher
and a highly attuned

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
empathetic healer, who's
become a YouTube sensation

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
with this healing and
often humorous videos,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
through the invitation to
join the love revolution that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:90%
begins with you.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:10%
Matt Kahn is also the author
of "Whatever Arises," "Love

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:10%
That," and "Everything
is Here to Help You."

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MATT KAHN: Thanks
for having me.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I love your
perspectives on things.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
They're just fantastic.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:10%
It's like you look through
life from a different lens.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:10%
But I have to ask you, how
did this all start for you?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
If I go back to my
childhood, which

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
seems so much like a mystery.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, I
had very confusing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:10%
emotional experiences, that
I'm sure a lot of people

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:10%
will resonate
with, where I would

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:10%
feel the emotions of other
people and my misunderstanding

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:10%
as I thought that the
feelings I felt in them

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:10%
was their opinion of me.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How many people do that?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I do that, yes.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Later in life, in
my spiritual evolution,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I came to know that
as a process called

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:90%
vibrational codependency.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:10%
And what I would do was, I
would work hard by entire life

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:10%
to cheer everyone up,
whether friends, my parents.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:10%
And only when they felt
better in my presence

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:10%
did I think that I was liked.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So I developed this
very low self-esteem,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
because I was empathing
other people's energy

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and then mistaking their
experiences to somehow

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%
be about me.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went through this
experience most of my life,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that it was really
a really extreme foundation

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:84%
for the work I do, which now I
can tune into people's energy.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But now as an attuned
empathic healer,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to use that ability
to help people unblock

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:90%
the blockages in their heart.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how did
that empathic ability

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
show up for you, as a child,
as a teen, as a pre-teen,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:90%
where did you end up?

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Wow, well,
I could profoundly

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:90%
feel other people's pain.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
loss in their life,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel the
lack in their life.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
from an early age,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I could feel what people
wanted and didn't have.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it somehow became
my mission, in some way,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how do I
become what they need.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So if someone was alone
and needed friendship,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.902 align:middle line:90%
I had to be their friend.

00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
the people pleaser.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
This is how that starts.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: 100%.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Right, and the people
pleaser, thank goodness,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
after many years, transformed
into a light worker.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But I spent my entire
childhood lost in people

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
pleasing because I
didn't know how to be OK

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:90%
when other people weren't OK.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would
rather not be OK,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
because I can actually
be OK in not being OK.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But to see someone
else not be OK

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have the
tools to deal with it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:90%
was agonizing for me.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does that mean you
could be OK with not being OK?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: From a very
early age, and I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.224 align:middle line:84%
was raised in a family
of loving parents,

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
but I was raised in
a family where there

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of tumultuous
emotional energy,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to where at the drop of
a dime, a parent would

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
go from being your friend and
your ally to being a monster.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.774 align:middle line:84%
And not in a tragic way
or not in an abusive way--

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just the
way they knew it.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.231 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: The way they knew
it from their paradigm,

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
from their triggers.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a kid, any time
someone would get upset,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.157 align:middle line:84%
I immediately thought that
I was doing something wrong.

00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially
being so sensitive.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Being so sensitive.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And because my family,
there was a lot

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
of aggressive, emotional
energy that would constantly

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
be triggered, I had to
develop this ability

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to be OK in
the fire of intensity.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about siblings,
anyone else around having

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:90%
the same experience?

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: You know, my sister
is 10 years older than me.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So I was kind of
raised as an only child.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.922 align:middle line:84%
Because by the
time I came to be,

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
my sister was already
having our own life

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:90%
in high school and college.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So I was kind
of raises an only child.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
kind of a family

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
where if someone needed to
confront you, in that moment,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
right then and there, no
questions asked, here we go.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So I was I was raised
in an environment where you

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:90%
could be backed into a corner.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:90%
We have to have a conversation.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time
we have to have it.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing to
do but deal with it.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think-- and I know
that sounds really intense.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:10%
But I was I was raised
in an environment where

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have a lot of options.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But also
that confrontational,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:90%
constant confrontation--

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --means
there's no safety.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: No safety.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.696 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And so-- and
this is going to--

00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
this is just the words
that come into my mind

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
when I tune into that.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
There was no safety, but
there was a moment or a point

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
where I stopped
looking for safety.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did that do?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: That relaxed me.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed me to be in
the midst of an environment

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.636 align:middle line:90%
where I would feel threatened.

00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst of
feeling threatened,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
something would
change inside of me.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would just find myself
inside of my body, watching.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would watch the
trigger of a family member.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I would watch their
confrontation with me.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I would watch my body
and my nervous system

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
respond to their energy.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is,
when people are expressing

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
aggressive energy, we're
reflecting it back out

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
with our nervous system.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I would watch my
nervous system respond

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:90%
to their nervous system--

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:84%
aggressive energy
reflected back, passive.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'd watch the play.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, and I know

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that sounds really strange,
I stopped looking for safety.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like I would
feel unsafe for 10 seconds,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and then somewhere in that
experience, a sense of safety

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even a
question anymore.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I was watching, I
was observing, I was feeling.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:90%
But I was affected.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was
something in me that

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
started to study my interactions
with people like it was

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:90%
some sort of training ground.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing this since
I was a very small child.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had this innate
ability to just

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:84%
watch, and to observe, and
to learn through observation.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
watch the patterning,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: --shutting down.

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Yeah, I
think disassociation

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
is a form of denying what's
happening I wasn't denying

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was happening,
it was just that it

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:90%
wasn't happening to me anymore.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
still dissociation,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:90%
but you've embraced the moment.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You embraced it,
you became one with it.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Yeah, and what I
noticed is when there was--

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
when I noticed that it
was happening, but it--

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:90%
how can I put this into words?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
What I would notice is
that in the beginning,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.999 align:middle line:84%
there was an attack
coming towards me.

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there would
be this opening, where

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
I would see my parent
is not attacking me,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.476 align:middle line:84%
they're actually sharing
their history of pain with me.

00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you saw through it.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a big difference.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:90%

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I see.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So, it wasn't
like I removed myself

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to get away from the pain of
identifying with the attack.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I would actually see that while
it looks like my mother is

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
attacking me, I was watching
my mother act out to me the way

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:90%
her father had treated her.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So my mother was
showing me her wounds.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Her pain.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And on a soul level, it

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you
what I went through,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%

you where you want to be met.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.368 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: And I would see that.

00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to do with it.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was, I
would start to see that,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
from a very early
age, even though I

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't put these pieces together
until I was an adult, that when

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought that other people's
experiences were caused by me,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I was in an experience
where I was focusing on I am

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:90%
the victims of someone's pain.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
When I would start to
spontaneously see differently,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like I would
wake up out of the belief

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.859 align:middle line:90%
that I am the cause of this.

00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
That was the prime
belief in my mind,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is I am the cause of this.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Soon as I am the cause
of this would disappear,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I would actually see that
what is coming towards me

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is someone showing me
their unresolved past.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%

when I was eight,

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I had this experience.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself in a
garden that I'd never been in.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
profound knowing of I

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
don't know where I am, but
I'm totally safe, which

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.314 align:middle line:84%
was something I'd never
felt. And then I was

00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:90%
walking through this garden.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And the colors of
this garden were

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
so brilliant, were
so bright, it was

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
like they were overflowing
with the vibration of love.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a greater love than
I had ever felt for my family.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
It held me in a level of safety
that I can actually still

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:90%
feel to this day.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%

my being as a permanent imprint

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
from that eight-year-old
experience.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
through this garden

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:90%
of waist-high flowers.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling my
little eight-year-old legs

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
pushing through these
waist-high flowers.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I was noticing
that I was also hovering

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.699 align:middle line:90%
above my body, watching this.

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how both
things were happening,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
but the love was so immense
it was just accepted.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in front of me,
about 20 feet in front of me,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
was a man with long dark hair,
a beard, and a white robe.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:90%
He motioned towards him.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't move.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was hovering
above the flowers too.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I started floating
towards this man automatically.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I got about as close
to him as I am with you.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And out of his eyes were
just pure white light.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.794 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, I
thought of like scary movies,

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
where people roll their
eyes up in their head.

>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: That broke the
state of the experience.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I fell through the
garden, through the sky,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and back in my body.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And only when I fell back in my
body did I know that I left it.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was freezing cold.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I was dripping with sweat.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the same being in
this white chalky material

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
in the corner of my bedroom,
motioning me towards him,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and I looked and he disappeared.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day, I
went to a friend's house,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:90%
talking about this experience.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.396 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: I was in
their living room

00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
painting on the wall.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the painting, I
said that's who I met.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And with absolute irreverent
certainty, that's who I met.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And my friend said, Matt,
you did not meet Jesus.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And my friend said, Matt, you're
Jewish, you don't meet Jesus.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know the
big deal, but I just

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
know that's who I met.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I had no historical
reference really

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of who Jesus was.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard his name,
didn't know what it was.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And all I can tell you is, there
was a meeting in that moment,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:90%
there was an activation.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And ever since that moment,
I felt guides walking with me

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:90%
in my peripheral vision.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I would know things without
knowing how I knew things.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think at eight, that's
what created this perspective

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
shift, where in the middle
of some sort of heated attack

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.806 align:middle line:90%

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:90%

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, experience.

>>KAHN: --imprint inside of you.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And so I
would be able to--

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.063 align:middle line:84%
and what's interesting
is when I would

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
have these arguments
with my parents,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't feel the guides
with me at that point.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.518 align:middle line:84%
I would just have this
perspective shift,

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
where I could see that anything
someone was saying to me

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:84%
was their soul opening
up their body, showing me

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:90%
what is unresolved with them.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And then years later
what I realized,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the energy field that
we all live in, when activated--

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
mine got activated at eight
from that experience--

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is that people are showing
you their unresolved pain,

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and it is our energy
fields that are

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:90%
healing that as we witness it.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know I was actually
already living as a healer.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so now, you find
someone in today's adult life.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is, that you
have an adversity with,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:90%
or rubs you the wrong way.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or just doesn't gel.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you go
into resentment?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Or do you go into that
same eight-year-old

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:90%
boy that could see the layers?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.151 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Oh, I have been--
over the years, from all

00:14:32.151 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the experience I've had, from
the eight-year-old experience,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and I've had so many more,
I have been permanently put

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
into this perspective, what's
called an abiding awakening.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I live in what's
called Samadhi, which

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is a living meditative
trance, which

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is how I'm able to transmit
healing energy when I speak.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And that there is no
perspective I take,

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
there is just what I see.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And other people's
experiences don't pull me

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:90%
into confrontation.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't pull me
into an engagement.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying
to get away from it.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just that when an
activation like this happens,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
you get so close to
the present moment,

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
you get so intimately enmeshed
in reality that no one can

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:90%
pull you out of that center.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not me trying
not to stay centered

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
or get pulled out of it, there's
just nothing to pull me out of.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's really nothing
for me to do, but to one,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
see their pain being expressed.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually, and
nowadays, in this scenario,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I can actually feel my
energy field brighten.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it going
into their field

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and actually clearing
out of them what they're

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:90%
allowing them self to release.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But from their
perspective, it might come

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:90%
in some sort of an accusation.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Even though in today's
day, I don't experience

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
mostly anything other
than positive experiences,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.306 align:middle line:84%
I am able to clearly just hold
space in a way where I don't

00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
even have to make a choice.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.513 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite a relief.

00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's take a look
at Matt talking about pain.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
we're going to learn

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:90%
how to do this ourselves.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And I think
today's teaching about pain

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
as sacred medicine is very
crucial and instrumental.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And let's actually
do the healing work

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that let's these parts be
seen, heard, and recognized.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So that you don't have to hold
the past in your cellular body.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You can simply move forward
into your predestined future.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the balance.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
When you make choices,
you make choices

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:90%
based on what feels good.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in a
situation already,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and something happens,
and your reaction

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
is you don't feel
good, your reaction

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of not feeling good or not
feeling good in response

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
to an outcome is medicine.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the spiritual
journey, we must

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
find this level of safety,
and at ease-ness, and peace.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first moment we
start to spiritually explore

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Because spiritual
exploration only

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.325 align:middle line:84%
occurs beyond the
threshold of problems.

00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so that
was you transmitting.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:90%
And I could see and feel that.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But how do you teach people to
deal with that on their own?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You really had an interesting
perspective there about pain.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Being like
a master teacher.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
that when we're

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
going to really look at the
plight of human suffering--

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: --I think we have
to really make a decision.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And the decision
is, do I believe

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
or can I embrace that
every single thing that

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
comes up in my
experience is a part

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:90%
of my evolutionary process?

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a part of me that
is still entangled in the belief

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that someone is doing
something to me?

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have to first make
a choice with, OK, I'm in pain.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.755 align:middle line:84%
I could deal with the
injustice of pain--

00:18:17.755 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't deserve this, after
all I've done for the world.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Victimhood,
and so forth--

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --yes.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So I can go into blame,
I can go into that situation.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Or I can say to myself,
OK, I didn't ask for this,

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:90%
it chose me.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Pain came to me
like a vision quest,

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
like a spirit guide
knocking at our door that

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
says you are now ready for
the next level of mastery.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
That is a great way
of looking at pain.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Thank you.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As our teacher.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: As our teacher.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.903 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As an opportunity.

00:18:45.903 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Right, when
you're ready to graduate,

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
you would think the graduation
would be greater elation.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But what makes room
for greater relation

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is the deconstruction
of our conditioning.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And the deconstruction
of our conditioning,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
when occurring greatly under
a short period of time,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:90%
is rather painful.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So pain is teaching
us we are going

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
through massive transformation
under a short duration of time.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And the entire
vision quest of pain

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
is can you allow your mind
to become aware of the fact

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that your body is able to relax,
even in the presence of pain,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't ask
for, and do not prefer.

>>LISA: This is the
time where you really--

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm reflecting on times of pain.

spiritual medicine.

>>KAHN: Absolutely.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%

back on those and I see

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:90%
they were my greatest teachers.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%

tell you in the moment--

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Of course.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that I ever would
find that perspective.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Even to the fact that I know,
I'm going to look back at this

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%

be a great moment.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
But right now--

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:90%

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Totally.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.195 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
get from there to there?

00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Well,
that's interesting.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- so,
historically speaking,

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
most people in the moment aren't
going to be able to get there.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's only in
retrospect are they

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to see from
a different perspective.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But I think that because the
spiritual evolution of humanity

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
is changing, the
conversation is changing.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And the teachings that I've
been asked to bring forth

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
is because we're coming
to a period of time

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:84%
where human beings are able to
actually have this perspective

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
shift in the presence of
pain, not just afterwards,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.585 align:middle line:90%
looking back in retrospect.

00:20:34.585 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so it's shortening.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So when we're
actually evolving to able

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to have that awareness
in the moment,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
part of the first
step of this is

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to know that pain
is the releasing

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
of cellular imprinting
in our body.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
cellular imprinting

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
of our past, whether
abuse or neglect,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
in either situation
of neglect or abuse,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of us
that didn't have a voice

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:90%
and didn't have a choice.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times,
people in the moment

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
will say, I can't be at peace,
I have to just rant and rave.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But from my perspective,
the ranting and the raving

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is putting a voice and
giving yourself the choice

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to express what was shunned,
silenced, and suppressed

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:90%
from past traumas.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, the first
step of getting to relaxation

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is first giving yourself
permission to put a voice,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
put a sound to the
pain you're in.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It may be words, expletives.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It may just be
sounds and groans.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
As long as we're putting sounds
to our pain, what are we doing?

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.814 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing.

00:21:45.814 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're getting
it out of ourselves.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: That's right.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
As long as--

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.921 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just moving it out,
energy, just moving it.

00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: >>LISA: Yes, so as long
as we are making sounds with

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:90%
our pain, we are breathing.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And when we're breathing
while in the presence of pain,

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we are relaxing
our nervous system.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And to relax or nervous system
is teaching our subconscious

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:84%
mind that that pain doesn't have
to be like a foreign invasion.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It can be like revisiting
a familiar friend.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we start to change
the association.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see
how that would work.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
way you say it does

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:90%
have a certain energy to it.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's, if we can,
reframe some of these words,

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
like you just did
with the word pain.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the word victimhood?

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Victimhood, I
think that victimhood

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is giving a voice to the
parts of ourselves that have

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:90%
been silenced and suppressed.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that the ability to
speak out what we're feeling

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a very therapeutic thing.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.554 align:middle line:84%
And when I worked
with a lot of people,

00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly something
that can be done.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the difference
is, and here's

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the real slight differentiation,
can we voice words

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
about being in pain without
it being about those

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.137 align:middle line:90%
we think have caused the pain.

00:23:10.137 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big difference.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.428 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Big difference.

00:23:12.428 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because there's blame.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: That's right.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a huge piece.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%
They did this to me,
who are they to do this?

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
How could they do
this type of thing?

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Who does that?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's all that.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's the
responsibility of taking--

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:84%
take abuse, for example,
how does a child

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
take responsibility
for being abused?

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.463 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: I'm not sure a child
does take responsibility--

00:23:37.463 --> 00:23:38.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:23:38.262 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: But it's the
adult they become

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that takes responsibility.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.405 align:middle line:90%
So the child's job--

00:23:43.405 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The child's--

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: The child's job
is to process the abuse.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to go through
a lot of different stages,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.719 align:middle line:84%
whether it's blaming themselves
for it, defending their abuser.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There's all these things that
happen when we go through

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:90%
trauma, abuse, and neglect.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:90%
But it's the adult.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And especially when we have
children that, unfortunately,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
go through abusive situations,
especially when I've

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:84%
worked with parents
who are wanting

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to raise their children
spiritually, what I often

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
see happen is they
want their children

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
to process their
feelings and heal,

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes there is a
pushing a child too fast,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
as if that child needs to have
adult spiritual perspective,

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
instead of allowing the child
the greatest gift, which

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:90%
is the journey of time.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Right, because the
child becomes the adult.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
adult perspective,

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:84%
we can start to do
a lot of deep work.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that a
lot of the spiritual work

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
is very therapeutic
for an adult.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The work that can be
beneficial for a child,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:90%
is actually more creative based.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So we get our children to,
let's draw our feelings out.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
When we're angry,
what color is it?

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's turn on some
music and dance out.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's dance out anger.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's dance out frustration.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's draw pictures
of what it felt

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
like to not have a voice in that
moment where we had no control.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.299 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we're
dealing with children,

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
creative expression.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
When we're dealing
with adults, we're

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.939 align:middle line:84%
looking at spiritual
exploration.

00:25:14.939 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
you're talking about

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is looking at it from a
different perspective.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything is here to
teach us something.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But if that's the
case, do we make mistakes?

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe there is
such thing as mistakes?

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: It depends the level
on which we're looking at.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
There is both the level
where everything is perfect

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and there is no mistake.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But then that, as a trap,
can be an oversimplification.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes--

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: And a justification.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That spiritual
perspective, everything

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:90%
is happening for a reason.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And sometimes,
I mean, Matt,

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:84%
do you really think there's a
reason for everything bad that

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:90%
happens in the world?

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: I would
say there is always

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
a reason why things happen,
but those reasons are not

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
justifications to short cut
or short side the evolution

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of our healing journey.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time, just
because everything happens

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
for a reason, on a
soul level, on a very

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
human level, the ability
to act out a mistake--

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:90%
and what is a mistake?

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But as an opportunity
for you to act

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:84%
from a level of
consciousness that is not

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
matching your highest
wisdom, only as a

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
set up, so that when you look
back in retrospect, seconds

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
later, or years later, you're
able to receive the wisdom

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
at that moment that
you weren't ready

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:90%
for in that momentary decision.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.303 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So there's
the dimension where

00:26:33.303 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
mistakes are helping us to align
our actions with our highest

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:90%
values.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Once we graduate to a different
level of consciousness,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain level of
perfection in the universe.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
But in perfection,
there is the ability

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to admit how imperfect and
unjust things seem to be.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you do have some very
unique perspectives on things.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, I want to play a
little game with you, OK?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

>>KAHN: Fear is repressed,
condensed passion.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So fear is the passion we
have not expressed or let out.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So fear is not a
lack of courage.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It is an artistic, creative
crisis, where the inner artist

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is bottled up and not
brought out to play,

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:84%

creative life force energy

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%

how we reclaim our power

Overwhelm.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Overwhelm
is when we have

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
gone through too much
healing, or we're

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
doing too much multitasking,
and our nervous system

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is telling us, you are
not giving yourself

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
enough space to rest,
ground, and for renewal.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So overwhelm is when
we start to shut down

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
as a way of reminding ourself
of the lack of space or rest

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:90%
that we truly need to receive.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.954 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about hate.

00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Ooh, hate is a
sophisticated sabotage

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
program, where we are
projecting our own inadequacies

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
onto others as a way of keeping
others from connecting with us.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because on the level of
ego, the greatest fear

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
is, I will connect
with someone intimately

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as I open up to
intimacy, to be vulnerable,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and to be open, now I have
something and someone to lose.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The ego is most afraid of
loving and losing that love.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So hate is how people project
as a defense mechanism all

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.995 align:middle line:84%
their unresolved healing
energy onto other people

00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to keep people rejected, so to
avoid being rejected or seen

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
as an inadequate
by another person.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they
attract more hate.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Right, because
as long as we are hating

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and we are attracting
hate, we're

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
so busy defending
a standpoint, we

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
don't have to risk losing
anything we don't let in.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's an absolute cop out and
refusal to surrender to love.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I seem to find that
a lot in political figures.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Yeah, and we
can even take it deeper.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So a refusal to love
is what hate is.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But then hate is a
defense mechanism

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that protects people from
the real thing they're

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:90%
the most afraid of, loneliness.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So hatred--

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, yeah.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Because
in loneliness, we

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
come into oneness
with ourselves.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.859 align:middle line:84%
We are not having those
to be validated by.

00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually
look at ourselves

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
directly, which is a
part of the turning

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
inward process of awakening.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So as a defense
against awakening,

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and as a war against
the loneliness that

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
becomes the
unraveling of the ego

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and the awakening
of the soul, we

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.810 align:middle line:84%
hide behind hatred as a
war against the benefits

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:45.640 align:middle line:90%

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:90%

jealous of in other people,
like other people may have a job

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:90%
is Hear to Help Us."

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KAHN: Everyone knows
the purpose of life

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.549 align:middle line:10%
is to live with an open heart.

00:34:21.549 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes on a
spiritual journey,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.465 align:middle line:10%
we're so gung-ho on
our goals that we

00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:28.090 align:middle line:10%
forget how to approach it in the
most heart-centered and loving

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:28.890 align:middle line:10%
way.

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.600 align:middle line:10%
What's the most loving way to
deal with stress and adversity?

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:10%
What's the most loving
way to deal with jealousy?

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:10%
What's the most loving
way to resolve anger?

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:10%
What's the most loving way to
get ourselves through pitfalls

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.469 align:middle line:10%
and patterns of sadness?

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:44.230 align:middle line:10%
This book assists
you in learning

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.046 align:middle line:10%
how to deal with every aspect
of your spiritual journey

00:34:47.046 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:10%
in the most loving,
heart-centered way.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.550 align:middle line:10%
We know to be loving,
we know that we are here

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:10%
to give and receive love.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.170 align:middle line:10%
But how do we actually
do it in a way that

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:10%
helps us fulfill
our spiritual goals,

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.012 align:middle line:10%
instead of undermine them?

00:35:01.012 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
why I wrote this book,

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:10%
"Everything is
Here to Help You,"

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:10%
to help you shift out of
the ego and into the soul,

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:10%
out of your inner prison and
into the light of your highest

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.857 align:middle line:10%
perfection, but in
the most loving way.

00:35:12.857 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:10%
Because if we're not doing
it in the most heart-centered

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:10%
perspective, we're going
to reach for goals,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:10%
but we're not going
to quite get there.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:10%
So the goal is to be loving
and a heart-centered.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:10%
And in order to make
this instinctive, instead

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.216 align:middle line:10%
of exhausting, there's a certain
most loving way we go about it.

00:35:28.216 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote this book.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.745 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So everything
is here to help us,

00:35:35.745 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:10%
but I got to back
to complaining.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:10%
>>KAHN: I love it.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How does
complaining help us?

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.760 align:middle line:10%
>>KAHN: OK, so we have to
see it from a very specific

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:10%
perspective.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.573 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So, OK, let's make two
great points about complaining.

00:35:47.573 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:10%
>>KAHN: So we talked
earlier that hatred

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:10%
is a war against loneliness.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So when we
are complaining,

00:35:55.870 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
we're actually looking for
resonance in other people,

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're putting out this
energy that says, I'm lonely,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not whole within myself, I
need attention and validation

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:90%
from other people.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
put out a complaint,

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not ready to
leave my negative standpoint.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I just want to see
if there's people

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:90%
that will keep me company.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right--

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: --the mechanism.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Misery loves company.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Right, so there's a
desire for social interaction

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.096 align:middle line:84%
in complaining, as we refuse
to leave the negativity

00:36:30.096 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and open up to the
light of positively.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
On that level, that's
how we understand

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the compulsion of
complaining, is

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that everyone can
voice their opinion,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and then we start to find
who we resonate with.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like complaining
is the shadow's form of finding

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.070 align:middle line:90%
it's soul family.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: In a very funny way.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.414 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a big group, and
you're part of an organization,

00:36:51.414 --> 00:36:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, oh,
they did that wrong, they

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
did that wrong, then
you find your people.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Isn't that just
the juiciest thing.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Here's my people.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Oh, my god,
we all get each other.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And we call that
being real, don't we?

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.635 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Oh, it's so clever.

00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:04.524 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then we
create a coup, yes.

00:37:04.524 --> 00:37:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: But the
second part of it,

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
which I just came
up with recently,

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
because I download
all these teachings,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:90%
is that we are beings of source.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And source energy, the
light, is a creative energy.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.067 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to self-reflect,

00:37:22.067 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
constantly changing.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:90%
So we are creative beings.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So in our presence,
creative energy

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:90%
is always trying to flow.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Now when people awaken,
what we're awakening

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
is the consciousness
of creative energy.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the first
level of creative energy,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:84%
going from bottled-up
repression into expression,

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we look at
the forms of life.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And our first
level of creativity

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:84%
is how creatively can I
change the things in view

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:84%
as a way of bringing my own
inner artist to the table?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So complaining is how
someone's first level

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:90%
of creative expression--

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Happens.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: --is being creative,
but they're creatively saying,

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
here's how I think this moment
needs to change, instead

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of the creativity,
which is, what am I

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.390 align:middle line:84%
going to bring forth to the
world that is expressing

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:90%
what I'm for and not against?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So when someone is complaining
to us about something else,

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:84%
or even criticizing
us, I've really

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:84%
sat with the experience
of their criticism of me

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is their creativity
bubbling to the surface.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Because my creative
energy as source,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is bringing their creative
energy alive within them.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And the first level
of creative expression

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.930 align:middle line:84%
is here's how creatively
I can pick apart

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.490 align:middle line:90%
what I don't like about you.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I
think needs to change.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a wonderful way of even
accepting creative criticism.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Absolutely.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And constructive
criticism, and it

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
can be without you
getting defensive,

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and your ego coming
out and saying,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:90%
nope, I need to be the boss.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can
actually grow more that.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.760 align:middle line:90%
You can evolve more in that way.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.355 align:middle line:90%
Ego comes out first though.

00:39:03.355 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: It always does.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.730 align:middle line:90%

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:84%

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:90%

>>KAHN: The lion comes out

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.117 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm in the presence
of someone, and nowadays,

00:39:14.117 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't happen
that often, but when

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the presence of someone
who is being critical of me,

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.890 align:middle line:84%
or just being
critical, what I know

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is this, how graciously I
receive their criticism,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:90%
two things occur.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If I receive their
criticism graciously,

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I take their darkness, I
transmute it into the light.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't
drink their poison,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I receive their blessing
on the soul level.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And if I can receive their
criticism graciously,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I've done one powerful thing.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is, help this
person get one step closer to

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
instead of leading
with the criticism,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.885 align:middle line:90%

I don't happen to keep up
on those subject matters.

00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:84%
My way of watching the news is
that whatever I need to know,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:90%
people tell me.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's my reporter.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.241 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And so, this
person's talking

00:40:27.241 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:84%
about political
turmoil, all this stuff.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: 10-minute tirade.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there, breathing
slowly, holding space for them.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there, and
what I said to them was,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate-- and I
meant this from my heart--

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
sharing with me what

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle line:90%
you're most passionate about.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And they stopped
and looked at me.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When most-- you can see
in their eyes, most times

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.550 align:middle line:84%
they go off on political stuff,
and it creates this deflection

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:84%
energy, where they guarantee
the rejection that they've

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
had in the past, that they're
afraid to revisit again

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest fear
most people have is I'm

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.060 align:middle line:84%
afraid to put my best
foot forward, because what

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.440 align:middle line:90%
if I put my best foot forward--

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I get rejected.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: --and it
still isn't enough?

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So I'd
rather just sabotage

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.667 align:middle line:84%
and at least know, oh, they
couldn't handle the truth

00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm talking about.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.921 align:middle line:84%
It's a very entitled,
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So they came out with
me with this tirade.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said I really appreciate
you sharing with me what

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
you're passionate about.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't respond
to whether I agree

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:90%
with their political standpoint.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I talked about their
expression of passion.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to
them, I would love also

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to know if there's anything
else you're passionate about,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and the invitation went deeper.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't go there,
but I opened the door.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And I remained open to them.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
what I did to them

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
is I showed them that
on a subconscious level,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.706 align:middle line:84%
if you want to share
something deeper, you're safe.

00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
to open the door.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's nice.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And I had someone
else once give me some very

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:90%
constructive criticism.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, thank
you for offering me

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:90%
that constructive criticism.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
me, point blank,

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.670 align:middle line:84%
do you think you're
going to implement this--

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, yeah--

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.556 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: --into your life?

00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --I going to ask, yeah.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And I said,
I don't necessarily

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:84%
resonate with what you're
sharing as if that's my truth,

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.980 align:middle line:84%
but I'm glad you've
shared your truth with me.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
way of saying that.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.063 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Because I want to
make sure in this conversation

00:42:27.063 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that when I'm showing the
way in which we can engage,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.975 align:middle line:84%
it always has to
do with honesty.

00:42:30.975 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it always has
to do with them, not you.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.975 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: That's right.

00:42:33.975 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're constructive
criticism was more about--

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and in the position
I was in, I was

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
talking to someone, who in their
life works in the same field

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.720 align:middle line:84%
as I do and deep
down wants to be

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.170 align:middle line:90%
seen on a very certain level.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So their
feedback to me was,

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.220 align:middle line:84%
first, they revered
my teaching, then

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:84%
they felt inferior to
what I was offering,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
feel on the same level.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So they projected
something on to me,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
so that they would have
something to share.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh--

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: And I saw that.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You'll have the same
experience with difficult

00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:07.285 align:middle line:90%
bosses--

00:43:07.285 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --or coaches--

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --or teachers.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.630 align:middle line:10%
And whenever there's another
person in the authority

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:10%
position, the student
or whoever it is

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.740 align:middle line:10%
has to be in that
subservient position.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's not comfortable.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So to speak your truth
and not get or feel

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.415 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
get yourself in trouble

00:43:30.415 --> 00:43:31.373 align:middle line:90%
or in a confrontation--

00:43:31.373 --> 00:43:32.225 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Sure.

00:43:32.225 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that's a
wonderful way of doing it.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.683 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And even, God forbid,
if someone were to say something

00:43:36.683 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and it cost them their
job, isn't a setback, just

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.229 align:middle line:84%
a bigger set up for miraculous
possibilities to shine through.

00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny,
in the conversation

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going
to take that advice,

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.410 align:middle line:90%
thank you very much.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, if you're
not going to take the advice,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.180 align:middle line:90%
why are you thanking me?

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.430 align:middle line:90%
So this was interesting.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them, I said,
because you're offering me

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.140 align:middle line:84%
a perspective, because
you want to make

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:90%
sure I don't miss anything.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And that tells me how much
you're supporting me and having

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:90%
my back.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thanking you
for supporting me

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:90%
through this journey.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to talk to
them about the highest case

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
scenario, even though that's
not where they were coming from.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.602 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That, I mean,
that's very grounded.

00:44:18.602 --> 00:44:20.268 align:middle line:84%
That's a wonderful
grounded perspective.

00:44:20.268 --> 00:44:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And it has
to do-- there's

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:10%
something you write about, about
the five stages of surrender.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.836 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you talk
a little bit about,

00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:90%
why would somebody surrender?

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Well, I think
that in the beginning

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual path,
there's the opening

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
the conversation to surrender.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.300 align:middle line:84%
There is often the
spiritual path of,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to surrender,
but it doesn't

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:84%
work, because people
are trying to surrender

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.190 align:middle line:90%
to get out of pain.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a bypass.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.117 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's the personal
abandonment, they just--

00:44:49.117 --> 00:44:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: They're trying
to surrender in order

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.185 align:middle line:84%
to lighten the load of
their personal experience.

00:44:53.185 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: When we get
to real surrender,

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.450 align:middle line:90%
real surrender isn't a choice.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just the game is over.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And you will get what
you want out of life,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:84%
or you won't, but you will
get everything life has

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:90%
planned for you.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you go at life
with your hands up,

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and you let life
guide you, you're

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.430 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
fulfilled by life's plan

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
than if you got every single
thing you ever wanted.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the outrageous
fortune of surrender.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is very expansive,
and at the same time,

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:90%
surrender can be very painful.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: It's extremely painful.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.760 align:middle line:90%

hurt other people than face and
surrender to the opportunity

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.701 align:middle line:90%

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Absolutely.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Surrender is surrendering
any limiting belief

no matter how much pain I'm in,

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.750 align:middle line:84%
there has to be something that
this is a way that this is

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:84%
helping me evolve the

radiant expression of myself.

we're surrendering

This is a wave that

It is a mode of
transportation when

we're actually trying to get

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.790 align:middle line:90%

we are not here to transform
things into growth.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:84%
We are here to grow by

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.290 align:middle line:84%

me, Matt, how can you

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.710 align:middle line:84%
sit so calmly, teaching

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.510 align:middle line:84%

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I have faced and felt pain.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Even recently in my life, I have
experienced everything everyone

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I experience from a
different perspective.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Someone says, how can you go
through this so peacefully?

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at them, I took
a deep breath, and I said,

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:90%
there's just nothing left.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.882 align:middle line:90%

have fought has been melted
away, has been wiped away.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I have never turned
away from pain,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.825 align:middle line:84%
simply because I never
even knew I had the option.

00:48:15.825 --> 00:48:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But don't you feel
passionate about things,

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.410 align:middle line:84%
like injustices in the
world, and want to correct

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.420 align:middle line:90%
them and right the wrongs?

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: I feel passionate
about how the things we see

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
are creating space for
deeper things to emerge.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sitting on my couch
with a passive perspective.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.792 align:middle line:84%
My entire life is dedicated to
the awakening of consciousness.

00:48:37.792 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people that want

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to stand on the front lines
doing petitions, protesting.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And if that's what they're
called to do, that's great.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.742 align:middle line:84%
I say, put your energy
towards the things

00:48:47.742 --> 00:48:49.450 align:middle line:84%
you're for not the
things you're against,

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.700 align:middle line:84%
which we've heard
throughout history.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.140 align:middle line:84%
My life is dedicated to
evolving the consciousness

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.890 align:middle line:84%
of human beings, because only
when human consciousness has

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.130 align:middle line:84%
evolved into unity consciousness
does that actually create

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the energetic framework for
all of the new social programs

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.550 align:middle line:90%
to be created and to stick.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So I can say that
in my life, I never

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.420 align:middle line:84%
want to see another
child abused again.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:84%
It breaks my heart every time
I hear of any kind of atrocity,

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:84%
abuse, the fact that there
are people in this world that

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:84%
have more food that
they can actually ingest

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and there are people in this
world that don't have any,

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:90%
which is a distribution issue.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But in my life, in
my heart of hearts,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I have been so affected
by these things

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that I've plead with
the universe use me.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Use me to bring
good to this planet.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happened.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So I am living my
life, even when

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing this with
you, I'm not onstage,

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I am praying for the
salvation of humanity.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I am living my life as
if every single heart is

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.320 align:middle line:84%
in my body and
the choices I make

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.280 align:middle line:84%
are inspiring the world
vibrationally to follow

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:90%
that lead.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So I literally live my life
as if the way I live my life

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.070 align:middle line:84%
is teaching the world
a new way to be.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:14.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's something that is a--

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a big mission.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.965 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: It's a big mission.

00:50:15.965 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's a

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:21.920 align:middle line:84%
There is no moment where I'm
not a part of this change.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see how

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.796 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Do you hear, see,
feel, touch, how do you

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.430 align:middle line:90%
communicate with your guides?

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: I see visions sometimes.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Mostly I hear and I feel.

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.145 align:middle line:84%
So I talk to them in
telepathic conversations

00:50:44.145 --> 00:50:45.870 align:middle line:90%
as clearly as we're talking.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:47.516 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
had that ability,

00:50:47.516 --> 00:50:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to where different
guides will come in,

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.737 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see like
an image in my mind,

00:50:50.737 --> 00:50:53.070 align:middle line:84%
like when your phone rings
and the picture of the person

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:53.335 align:middle line:90%
pops up.

00:50:53.335 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so you're just
thinking of them and they call.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: And they pop up, and
I have this conversation,

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I get this, either
this telepathic download,

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.280 align:middle line:84%
where I literally hear
their voice in my head.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And because my first
experience of awakening

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.130 align:middle line:84%
came when I was eight and
had the vibration of love,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.710 align:middle line:84%
every conversation I've ever
had with different beings

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:12.660 align:middle line:84%
always has the
vibration of love, which

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.370 align:middle line:90%
is how I knew to trust it.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.100 align:middle line:84%

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.421 align:middle line:84%
studio, where you're

It's the artistry of thought.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It's for me, my mind is--

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.480 align:middle line:84%
the what if, but just
pondering the cosmos.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And the energy I feel

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.680 align:middle line:84%
it is from the
inside out current.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.945 align:middle line:84%
When I'm receiving information,
from the outside in.

00:52:01.945 --> 00:52:02.250 align:middle line:84%

And whenever I'm just using
my mind, just to play,

00:52:11.847 --> 00:52:13.180 align:middle line:90%
it's always from the inside out.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
gravitational force.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are your guides
telling you these days.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is really the
message that's coming through,

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to
come through you?

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Well, the
whole mission right now

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
is relaxing the nervous
systems of human beings,

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.490 align:middle line:84%
because the more relaxed
are nervous systems are,

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:84%
the more our cellular bodies
can empty out the memories

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and imprintings of the past.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The easier time
our heart can open,

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and the easier
our heart can open

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the more we find ourselves
living instinctively in the way

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:48.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm describing.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And we live as the
soul, instead of hiding

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:90%
behind the defensiveness of ego.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
amazing things my guides

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.930 align:middle line:84%
ever taught me, it was
actually an experience I had,

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%
where I was called to
the Akashic records.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And I actually visited
the Akashic records

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like the
Lincoln Memorial to me.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And these pillars and--

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I walked up the steps, and
there was a light table,

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:90%
this glowing light table.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.974 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
ascended masters

00:53:10.974 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:84%
were standing around
it, waiting for me.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment,
was kind of funny,

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.600 align:middle line:84%
because it was all these beings,
and then there was just me.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big tall, yeah.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Like eight feet
tall, stoic beings.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.880 align:middle line:84%
My main guide, Malkesa looks
like Gandalf the Wizard,

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and talks all biblically--

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.360 align:middle line:90%
"My son"-- he talks like that--

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.250 align:middle line:84%
"By tomorrow's time"-- it's
all this biblical stuff.

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I go to this
Akashic records,

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:90%
which I've been before.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we have
something to show you.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.966 align:middle line:84%
And they all lift
underneath their chins,

00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:90%
like they're wearing masks.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And they pull up their masks,
and underneath the masks is me,

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.110 align:middle line:90%
under all of the masks.

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And I like gasped.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.753 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: But then I said to
them, it was an honest thing,

00:53:51.753 --> 00:53:53.515 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't get it.

00:53:53.515 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, I got that there
was something intense,

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:56.515 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't really get it.

00:53:56.515 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said we are not
only what you're becoming,

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
we are what you've
already become,

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and we are agents
of the divine who

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:06.430 align:middle line:84%
have stepped back in
time to visit ourselves

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual childhood.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: So then all the guides--

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.040 align:middle line:90%
So all the guides--

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you remember that?

00:54:13.456 --> 00:54:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: It's like
the feeling of love.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Say that again.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: So we are not
only what you're becoming,

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.960 align:middle line:84%
we are what you
have already become.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:84%
We are agents of the divine
who have stepped back

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:30.470 align:middle line:84%
in time to visit ourselves
in spiritual childhood.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So what that let me know
was that these beings were

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.750 align:middle line:84%
objects, or manifestations, of
my own highest consciousness.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Because my life knew myself
as Matt, this character,

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:51.530 align:middle line:84%
my mind had to create
higher characters

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to bring me the wisdom from
the outer layers of my energy

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:55:00.200 align:middle line:84%
From that experience, I
realized Matt and those guides

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.170 align:middle line:90%
are the same, one.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, everything

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
became just currents
of information

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that I would bring
forth to the world.

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How could this
help other people?

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Realizing that they are one, as
well, with their own guidance?

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
biggest stumbling blocks

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is that people say, I
don't hear my intuition

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:26.920 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have
guides talking to me.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I have the ability
to talk to guides.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I still know it's all a
part of my one eternal self.

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But I still have conversations
with guides, ascended masters.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Meetings with the
galactic council.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I have very esoteric
experiences,

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.690 align:middle line:84%
but my awakenings have
allowed it to be very grounded

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and still have a very deep
understanding of how this

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.580 align:middle line:90%
works on an archetypal level.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.876 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
a lot of people

00:55:51.876 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:84%
want to have conversations
with their guides,

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.958 align:middle line:84%
but if they have the kind
of access that they wanted,

00:55:55.958 --> 00:55:57.330 align:middle line:90%
they'd never leave their house.

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when we
really start to wake up out

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of the definition of,
I am this one person,

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and I want to have my
guides on speed dial,

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and we really relax, that
whole insistence, or I want--

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.430 align:middle line:84%
or the belief of if the universe
isn't talking my ear off,

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hearing the messages.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:22.937 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You need to
be really loud and--

00:56:22.937 --> 00:56:23.736 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Right.

00:56:23.736 --> 00:56:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The truth is whether you
hear the messages or not,

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:28.730 align:middle line:84%
or you're just guided to
be in the perfect moment

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:32.360 align:middle line:84%
or the perfect time,
you're always in alignment

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.420 align:middle line:84%
with your highest
living potential.

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
get really stuck

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.440 align:middle line:84%
on it needs to be
one specific way,

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of relaxing into
everyone's intuition

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.970 align:middle line:90%
works rather differently.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.850 align:middle line:84%
My intuition works
really differently

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.500 align:middle line:90%
than most other intuitives.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't learn the way
most intuitives learn.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.316 align:middle line:84%
I learned from the
universe directly.

00:56:52.316 --> 00:56:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I came into this
field, I started

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:55.260 align:middle line:84%
talking to other
intuitives, and I went, wow,

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.490 align:middle line:84%
we're speaking
different languages.

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:58.674 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Yeah, I have
different symbols.

00:56:58.674 --> 00:57:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I have different ways of
receiving information.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I transmit energy with
the sound of my voice.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't even do
energy work on people.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.480 align:middle line:84%
The energy that comes
through my words,

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.830 align:middle line:84%
it's like angels
coming through my voice

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and doing the healing on
behalf of who I'm working with.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I literally just speak and just
stand in someone's presence,

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and everything
happens by itself.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.440 align:middle line:84%

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:90%

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you,
when I was a kid,

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I was so energetically
sensitive.

I was so aware, but so immature,

I wanted to be around adults.

Everything bothered me.

00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I was happy if I was in
my room playing Nintendo,

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:47.900 align:middle line:84%
but this is my
parents would argue,

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to come out of my

thing in my family,

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that if someone's
not feeling well

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and I unexpectedly come to
town, someone's about to cross.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like
the angel of death.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.226 align:middle line:90%
My family--

00:59:28.226 --> 00:59:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
good reputation.

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: It's actually
very calming for me.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the room
when death is lurking.

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And when things
get really intense,

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I get very relaxed
and very focused.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So I helped my grandmother
relax and surrender

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:46.851 align:middle line:90%
to leave her body.

00:59:46.851 --> 00:59:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what
about your parents,

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.130 align:middle line:90%
who you're so close with?

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: You know, it's
a very funny thing.

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
love for my parents.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I learned from
a very early age

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that I was serving my parents'
evolution as their son.

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:10.289 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: But to me, it was a
conscious role I was playing.

01:00:10.289 --> 01:00:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And so I went to help
my parents crossover,

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.830 align:middle line:10%
honest to God, my experience
of my parents crossing over,

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and I can just share my
unique experience, was--

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.659 align:middle line:10%
I love both of my
parents, I actually

01:00:22.659 --> 01:00:24.200 align:middle line:10%
still talk to them
on the other side.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I connect with them
when I see them.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:32.760 align:middle line:84%
My experience of them was relief
because I thought now they're

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not limited by their
physical bodies anymore,

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
now they're out of
their ego structures,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%
now they can finally be free.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And the hardest thing for
me was watching my mom

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:45.720 align:middle line:90%
try to live without my father.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as my mom crossed
over, my parents were both free

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were both
together, dancing in heaven.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought my prayers
have been answered.

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Because all I wanted
was my parents

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to be together when their
work on this planet was done.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And when they both left,
I didn't feel relief

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
like my parents,

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I felt relief because I felt
like I fulfilled a mission

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.260 align:middle line:90%
as their spirit guide.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You were their
spiritual teacher.

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yes.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I always ask my guests, what
is your biggest why, as to why

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
you do what you do?

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
In a short answer, you can
just tell me, what is it.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Why I do what I do.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KAHN: Because
this is my calling.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.820 align:middle line:10%
And when you have been
called to do what you do,

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.870 align:middle line:10%
you make a choice that
doesn't feel like there

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:35.509 align:middle line:10%
are any other options.

01:01:35.509 --> 01:01:36.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's honest.

01:01:36.425 --> 01:01:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's honest.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Yeah.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, well, thank you so
much for sharing your journey

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.790 align:middle line:90%
with us.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAHN: Thank you.

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's been fascinating.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And for teaching us about how
to be conduits for the universe,

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and to listen to our guidance,
and for all that you teach,

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and how to utilize everything
being here to help us

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.731 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
