>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:10%
And we are coming to you
live from the Gaiam studios

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:10%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.052 align:middle line:10%
And since this is a
live interactive show

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:10%
I encourage you to
interact with us

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
through Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:10%
Many of you already have, so
keep the comments and questions

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:10%
coming throughout the show.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:10%
So with all of the challenges
that are going on in the world,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:10%
where do we even find
a place in our lives

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:10%
to have a conversation
about enlightenment?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And what is the difference
between self-awareness

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and narcissism?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.335 align:middle line:90%
Can we be too self-aware?

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Can we be so wrapped up
in our own complaints

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that we don't look at the
bigger picture of why we exist?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today is spiritual
teacher and cultural visionary

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Cohen.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to talk
about his new book,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.707 align:middle line:84%
"Evolutionary Enlightment- A New
Path to Spiritual Awakening."

00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
talk to us about how

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.144 align:middle line:84%
to achieve enlightenment in
the midst of all of our chaos.

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show,
thank you for being here.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW COHEN: Hi, Lisa.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a thrill to be with you.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's great, and an
honor to have you with us.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think that
people even seek enlightenment

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.829 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking for?

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, there's
a couple of reasons.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.975 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I think people
get tired of suffering.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So tired of pain?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: They get tired
of pain and suffering.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:10%
Also, I think sensitive,
thoughtful people

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:10%
want to have a
breakthrough where there's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:10%
a sense of actually being rooted
in something deeper than just

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
their ego.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and that's
where that question comes in,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
is what's the difference between
self-awareness and narcissism?

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can we be
too self-aware?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.085 align:middle line:84%
Can we be too caught
up in ourselves

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.547 align:middle line:90%
to even see the bigger picture?

00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, definitely.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.421 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there's
a cultural epidemic

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
in our day of narcissism.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And a narcissist is someone who
is compulsively self-concerned.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Always thinking
about oneself, always

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.124 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
himself or herself.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what we were
taught to do though, isn't it?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, we live in
a culture of narcissism.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
culture of flattery.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to learn, I
think at a very early age

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
these days, to always
be looking at ourselves

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror of our own mind.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.781 align:middle line:84%
And this can be emotionally and
spiritually quite suffocating.

00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was a bit
of a backlash though,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.196 align:middle line:90%
don't you think?

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:29.045 align:middle line:84%
Because now you get a trophy
for just playing a soccer game,

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
actually win anything

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:90%
to get the trophy these days.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was--

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You mean we get a
prize just because we exist.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, we get
a prize for existing.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Not because
we've necessarily

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%
achieved something great.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's that
a backlash from?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I
think this has to do

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
with the emergence of what's
called the sensitive self.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
1960s, the mere fact

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that we existed as
a sensitive, feeling

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
being was seen as having
great value in and of itself.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of merit
and of having to earn something

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and to develop started to take
a second place to the sense

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
of we're special simply
because we exist.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in the concept of
Evolutionary Enlightenment,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.692 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, that's putting
the traditional Eastern

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
notion of enlightenment--
and enlightenment

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
means the experience
of consciousness

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
beyond ego, or beyond
the small self--

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
in the context of our emerging
understanding of evolution

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:90%
that's based on Western science.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have been a
seeker of enlightenment pretty

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
much since your teenage
years, and now are

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
a teacher of this
vast, vast concept.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about how you started

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and what questions
did you ask when

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
you were young to seek
this enlightenment?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, for me I had an
extraordinary experience when

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I was a young person that
revealed to me that there's

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
much more going on here than
I had previously imagined.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.536 align:middle line:84%
I experienced, as
many teenagers do,

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience of what's
called cosmic consciousness

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
when I was a young person that
really knocked me for a loop.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
of beginninglessness

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and endlessness.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
An awareness of the
infinite, the whole universe

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
came alive in my own
mind and consciousness

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:90%
for a few moments one evening.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And those few moments, I
realize, were more real

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and I was more alive than
I'd ever been in my life.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So when I eventually
became a seeker

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my
early 20s, it was

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover what
had spontaneously

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:90%
occurred when I was a teenager.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.036 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were trying
to get back to that split

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
second moment you had.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.792 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yes, I was trying to
rediscover those few moments

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
in my life that I had no doubt
were more real than anything

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.346 align:middle line:90%
else I'd ever experienced.

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was that
complete total freedom

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
that you had in that moment?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It was perfect freedom.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
There was freedom from
self-consciousness--

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking
about narcissism.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
There was total freedom
from self-consciousness.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was an experience
of the inherent goodness

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and
existence itself.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a
clip here of something

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
called Kosmocentric
Orientation You can kind of get

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse into Andrew's world.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.758 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>>You want to begin
to see your experience

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:10%
as part and parcel
of a continuum.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:10%
So the continuum that
I'm speaking about

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.516 align:middle line:10%
began with the first cause, or
when the universe was created,

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:10%
when something
came from nothing.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:10%
That's when the
whole process began.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:10%
So that's when this continuum,
that's when time began.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And so we want to
begin to learn how

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:10%
to see your own experience
as the leading edge.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:10%
As the most sophisticated most
complex expression of a process

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:10%
that started 14
billion years ago.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.814 align:middle line:10%
And when you really
begin to get this--

00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:10%
not just at a rational
level, but that's

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:10%
a good place to start.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:10%
But when you begin
to see it and feel it

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:10%
you begin to relate your own
experience of being alive,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:10%
your own experience
of consciousness

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:10%
to the evolution of the cosmos

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:10%
So the reason why
this is so important,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:10%
this particular time in history,
is because more and more of us

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.306 align:middle line:10%
have to begin to get this.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.806 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
pull ourselves out

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:10%
of this narcissistic
nightmare and discover

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:10%
the inherently thrilling
nature and the sense

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:10%
of ultimate sacred
importance of who we are,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:10%
and what we're a part of,
and what we can actually do.

00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the way
to move beyond the ego

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.707 align:middle line:84%
is we have to want to
evolve beyond our own ego.

00:07:30.707 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to cultivate a
very big and profound

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
spiritual aspiration
to want to rise up,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
way up above the place
we've been living

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
in our own mind and
emotions for a long time.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to really
want to be free.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.097 align:middle line:90%
Really want to be free.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:90%
You want to be free.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what does
that mean to be free?

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.765 align:middle line:84%
And aren't we all
living to survive?

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, we might
be living to survive.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But the fears and desires
of the small self,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
once we transcend them, we
realize they're very small.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small little
place emotionally,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
psychologically,
philosophically.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small
little-- it's like living

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
in a little tiny
cave all by oneself.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you transcend
it, you realize

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.256 align:middle line:84%
that one was living in a
prison without even knowing it.

00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, the
prison can feel

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.213 align:middle line:84%
very safe and
comfortable because it's

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
what's usually very
familiar to us.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be willing to want
to leave that which is familiar

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
so we can experience the
enormous freedom that's

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of that.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you
had that experience,

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and when you have sought out
the teachings of amazing people,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
what is that light?

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Give us a glimpse
into what it means

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
to have that limitless complete
sense of enlightenment,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
of freedom.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it's
experiencing a boundarylessness,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
it's a freedom from boundaries.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the awakening to, at
the level of experience,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that which has no
beginning and no end.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously
recognizing that who you are

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and what we all are is
not separate from that

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
which has no
beginning and no end.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:90%
It's birthless and deathless.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's becoming self-aware,
or self-conscious

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
of the infinite nature of one's
own being of existence itself.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
our attachment to things,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and to people, and
to money separate us

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.679 align:middle line:84%
from that experience
you're talking about?

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, from an
enlightenment perspective,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
attachment to anything other
than that which is infinite,

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:84%
then that which has no
beginning and no end

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.664 align:middle line:90%
is going to cause us to suffer.

00:09:34.664 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's going to
cause detachment, right?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it will
cause attachment--

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Attachment, sorry.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.541 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It will
definitely cause it.

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:90%
We will suffer.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
separate from that attachment?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.255 align:middle line:84%
How do you get to a
place of non-attachment?

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.969 align:middle line:84%
It's a Buddhist
philosophy, right?

00:09:50.969 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, by coming to that
point in our own development

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.345 align:middle line:84%
where we want that which has
no beginning and no end more

00:09:58.345 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%
than we want anything else.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
We want the infinite.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We want ultimate spirit, the
limitless nature of spirit,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
of reality itself, more
than anything else.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We want to experience the
intimacy of that which

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is intimate more than
anything else in life.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:90%
That has to come first for us.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It has to become our absolute
priority before anything else.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we make that
shift, if we can do that,

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.086 align:middle line:84%
it brings so much space
to our relationships,

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to our relationship with
life, because we no longer

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
feel bound to people,
places, or things.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so this is what
you call nonduality, right?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.037 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, nonduality is the
awakening to the ultimate truth

00:10:41.037 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
about the self, and
the ultimate truth

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And all the great mystics from
all the religious traditions

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
in the world all say
that the ultimate truth

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of reality
and the nature of the self

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is there's only
one, and not two.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.674 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate truth is that
there's only one, and not two.

00:10:57.674 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And from an evolutionary
point of view--

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.881 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very interested
in evolution,

00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
which means we're all really
part and parcel of one

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:90%
creative process, right?

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
evolution we realize

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
burst into being

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%
almost 14 billion years ago.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And everything that exists
is part of that one process

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that is in progress, that's in
a state of cosmic unfolding.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And you, and I, and
everybody that's listening,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:84%
we're the eyes and
ears-- as human beings,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
as highly evolved human beings--
we're the eyes and the ears

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and the heart and the mind
of the entire process.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's one process,
and my body,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
my mind, and personality--
as is yours-- is

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
an expression and a
manifestation of that one

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does
that get us into what

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
you call evolution, our
future conversation?

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, when
you awakened evolution,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
evolution is a
moving train, it's

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
a process that's
going somewhere new.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.734 align:middle line:84%
In most of human
history, human beings

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
thought that nothing
was changing.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
That the cosmos was static,
that nature was static,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and that human history
and culture was static.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But now we realize that
the cosmos is moving.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:84%
That biological
life is evolving.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And that human consciousness
and culture is moving.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
So we're on a moving train.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.917 align:middle line:84%
We're part of a developmental
process that's going somewhere.

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And the most exciting
part of all this

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
is that our human
creative aspirations,

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual aspirations,
are an expression

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.436 align:middle line:84%
of the desire in the
universe to evolve,

00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and to develop, and to
become more conscious.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's basically
how to get unstuck,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
is by connecting into
that cosmic creation

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.173 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, sure.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Because for too many of us
we're living a small little life

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.395 align:middle line:84%
based upon our
psychological personality.

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:46.292 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
that who I really am

00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is not separate from the
energy and intelligence that

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
created the universe and is
creating the universe, that's

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:84%
awakening to itself in the
form of this body, mind,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and personality, our
experience, our sense

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
in the direct experience of
what it means to be alive,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes infused
with this awareness

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of this cosmic deep time, big
picture, big history context.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so our sense of being
alive grows enormously.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Life becomes really
big, really big.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.437 align:middle line:84%
Overwhelmingly big,
thrillingly big.

00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So great question
coming in from Facebook.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
One of our listeners is
saying, if I get this concept,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
how do I relate to others
that aren't interested in this

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
or are still in the
place, stuck in the ego?

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: When you
awakened evolution,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
you experience a
sense of inspiration.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.875 align:middle line:84%
You feel yourself to be
inspired by the same energy

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence that caused
the universe to come into being.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
When something came from
nothing, it was one big yes.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are
an individual who's

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
inspired, are turned on by, or
lit up by the creative process,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
other people are drawn to you
because you become a living

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
expression and manifestation
of the inherent positivity

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that is driving
this cosmic process.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So you become a very
attractive person

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
because you're turned on
by something very big.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And then people want to know,
man what's lighting you up,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
what's turning you on, why
you so inspired all the time?

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.758 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It makes you a
very attractive person.

00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What also makes the
other, maybe a negative source

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:90%
not stick to you?

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're kind
of a Teflon figure

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to that type of
negativity or depression,

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because you hold that space
that's creatively inspired.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And we talked earlier
about creative stress--

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
this is an amazing
reframe for me,

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
is to look at stress in
a totally different way.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
To find something that
is, as you said it,

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.854 align:middle line:84%
taps into our creation
of our universe,

00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and then that was
creative stress.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.645 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well the whole idea
is that the creative process

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is full of what I call
evolutionary tension.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So when the universe was
created, when the universe came

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
into being, it wasn't
a peaceful event.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a cosmic explosion.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Planets had to collide
into each other

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to create more
complex compounds that

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
would make it possible
for life to emerge.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
When we create
life, lovemaking is

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:90%
made through creative friction.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
When culture is created, when
philosophers come together

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to discuss big ideas,
there's a creative friction

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:90%
at the level of mind.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So creative friction,
which is the experience

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
of positive stress, is an
inherently positive thing.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that with
the negative stress

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
experience, which

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
is very common
these days, is when

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
we feel deeply consciously and
unconsciously deeply divided

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
about whether we
really want to be here.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.025 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're confused
about the relation

00:15:47.025 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to existential
questions, whether life

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%
is good, whether it's positive.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
When we feel deeply ambivalent,
knowingly or unknowingly,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
about being here we feel
overwhelmed by the stress

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.151 align:middle line:84%
But when we feel absolutely
free from ambiguity and free

00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
from division about
being here we're

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
sure we want to be here in
this body, in this mind,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:84%
as ourselves because we
want to do everything

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.460 align:middle line:84%
we can do to
wholeheartedly contribute

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to the evolutionary process
and where we're going.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The stress we experience is
that positive creative friction

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and we thrive on it.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm, interesting.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.395 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely a
different perspective

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.084 align:middle line:84%
from the debilitating
stress and looking at it

00:16:22.084 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:90%
as something that stops you.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
That type of stress
you're talking about--

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If we're resisting
life, if we're consciously

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or unconsciously
resisting and holding away

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the overwhelming reality of the
fact that we're already here

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to get with it
because the time's already up,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to experience
it as very negative and very

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.217 align:middle line:84%
unpleasant and we're going
to want to escape from it.

00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Many of our
Facebook questions

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that come in
constantly are talking

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:90%
about what is my purpose?

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you have been asked
that question a million times.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not what
is the purpose,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
but how do you experience
that sense of purpose

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
while you're seeking whatever
it is you're seeking?

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I think the
question is a lot of people

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.163 align:middle line:90%
want to know what my purpose is.

00:17:01.163 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But my response to the
question is, well, I

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
think first you want to
find out who you really

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
are before you find out
what your purpose is.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that when
we find out who we really are,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
we simultaneously discover
what our purposes is.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So from an evolutionary
perspective, who I am

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.709 align:middle line:84%
and who you are, beyond
the relative appearances

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.599 align:middle line:84%
of a male body, a
female body, you know,

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Andrew's personality
and Lisa's personality--

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.852 align:middle line:84%
we're both equally the
energy and intelligence

00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that created the
universe and is creating

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
the universe in the form of
Lisa and the form of Andrew.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.119 align:middle line:84%
So when I realized
that if I just

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
think of what does Andrew want?

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come
up with one answer.

00:17:39.715 --> 00:17:41.589 align:middle line:84%
And I And I think, well,
what does the energy

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence that
created the universe want

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
Andrew?, I'm going

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.969 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a
very different answer.

00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.676 align:middle line:84%
When you're saying
this, we are all one.

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
wondered this, how can

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you say that when
I don't consider

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:90%
myself one with a terrorist?

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't consider
myself one with someone

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
who wants to kill a child?

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, because
the positive things

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and the negative
things that occur

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
are still all part of
one creative unfolding.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How, how?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because if you
stand back and you look,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:90%
it's all one process.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.164 align:middle line:84%
And good and very positive
things happen in the process,

00:18:25.164 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and negative and horrible things
also happen within the process.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But the creative
process itself is one.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean that we need

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to feel good about bad
things that happen.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We want to do what we
can to correct them

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and to heal
woundedness, and we want

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to make the world
a better place.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But the perspective
of nonduality,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
the mystical insight into
the nature of reality

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:90%
is it's one happening.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's one event in which
all kinds of things happen,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:90%
both pleasant and unpleasant.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Good and evil, it's all
part of one unfolding.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the form
of the appearance

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
of a unique individual we
start taking certain positions

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that we prefer good over evil.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.734 align:middle line:90%
Happiness and not suffering.

>>LISA: Duality again.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%

mystical perspective

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
is we see it all as part
of one unfolding process.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, if you think
about what I was saying before,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
if planets had to
collide into each other

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to create more
complex compounds that

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
would make it possible
for life to emerge.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If we only looked at
the cosmic collision

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
as being a source of violence,
we would say that's bad.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, well,
that creativity also

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
served the evolutionary
process in the long run,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see that how
evolution unfolds is much more

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.617 align:middle line:84%
complex and integrated then
we can actually imagine.

00:19:49.617 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:90%

why this relates

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:90%
to Evolutionary Enlightenment.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
This gets us chunked up to
the biggest possible picture

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
to get unstuck and get out

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
of our own egoic
survival, essentially.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
When you have visited gurus,

have achieved enormous
enlightenment,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
what is their way of
bringing people up

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to this place of solving--
not even solving--

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
but basically solving
people's suffering

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and pain in the world where it
comes to hunger and starvation?

a traditional-- what I call,

00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I look at
it, a traditional notion

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment-- they
want to awaken people

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to what's called the timeless,
formless ground of being.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the deepest
dimension of reality,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and the deepest
dimension of the self.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's a place where there's
no time, in which there's

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
no space, in which
there's no world.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you enter very
deep states of meditation

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
we awaken to this timelessness,
to this formlessness,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.664 align:middle line:84%
to this place where
there's only being.

00:20:56.664 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place where
nothing ever happened before.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's what the Buddha called
the uncreated, the unborn.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if you enter into a
very deep state of meditation,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
eventually everything
will disappear

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.555 align:middle line:84%

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of awful
things happen in the world.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And nature, look
what nature is doing.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Nature has tsunamis,
and volcanoes, I mean,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:10%
it's a very dangerous
place to be.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, life is a
kind of dicey thing,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.646 align:middle line:10%
you don't know what
you're going to get.

00:22:16.646 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:10%
If we look at all these
particular problems, and all

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.995 align:middle line:10%
these unpleasant and nasty
and horrible things that

00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:10%
can happen, do happen,
will happen, have always

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:10%
been part of the
process, suddenly we're

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:10%
not so sure that to
exist is too good.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Because, oh, well,
living to exist is good,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.257 align:middle line:84%
but then there's pain, there's
suffering, there's death.

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:10%
What about all that,
why is there suffering?

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:10%
How could God exist as
long as there's pain?

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.104 align:middle line:10%
That kind of thing, right?

00:22:45.104 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:10%
So what if in the midst
of all this complexity

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:10%
and adversity if you
knew without any doubt

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:10%
that the urge to
exist, which relates

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:10%
to the Big Bang-- I interpret
the Big Bang as the desire

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.887 align:middle line:10%
to exist in time and in form.

00:22:58.887 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So what if you knew without any
doubt that the desire to exist

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.337 align:middle line:10%
was overwhelmingly
positive in spite

00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:10%
of all the terrible
things that happen

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.336 align:middle line:10%
in the process in
the midst of it?

00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:09.407 align:middle line:10%
But if you knew that
the will to exist

00:23:09.407 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:10%
which started with the Big
Bang, and which we experience

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:10%
as the sexual impulses,
the creative impulse,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.555 align:middle line:10%
as creative inspiration,
that the will to exist,

00:23:17.555 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:10%
the will towards life, and
the will towards creativity

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:10%
is overwhelmingly positive.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely
positive and good.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:10%
Would that change your
relationship to life?

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:10%
Because you know
that life is good.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Even though bad stuff happens,
you still now that life

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.397 align:middle line:90%
The will to exist is good.

00:23:37.397 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, so this brings
up a Facebook question.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:90%
How do we heal woundedness?

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, from an
enlightenment perspective,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
the best way to
heal woundedness is

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
deepest part of who you are

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
has never been hurt,
wounded or traumatized

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.295 align:middle line:90%
by anyone or anything.

00:23:53.295 --> 00:23:55.124 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, wow.

00:23:55.124 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The deepest part of
the self has never been born,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.081 align:middle line:84%
and never entered
the stream of time,

00:23:59.081 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and therefore is
untouched by anything

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:90%
that's ever happened in time.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, we can say
the energy and intelligence

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
that created the universe
and is creating the universe,

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the creative force in the
universe, called Eros,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:90%
is indestructible.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It can't be hurt,
wounded, or traumatized

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:90%
by anyone or anything.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It can't be stopped.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we
learn how to begin

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to identify with these
deeper dimensions of ourself,

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to identify
less with these more

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:90%
relative dimensions of the self.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to take our
woundedness a lot less

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's actually
beautifully said, Andrew.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Is that the deepest, truest part
of us was never really wounded.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.706 align:middle line:90%
Very, very powerful words.

00:24:44.706 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
We're going to come--

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's a
shift of identity.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
shift of identity.

00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:50.272 align:middle line:84%
And it's letting
go of our story.

00:24:50.272 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting over
those and looking at them

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.064 align:middle line:84%
as speed bumps in our overall
Evolutionary Enlightenment.

00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Being willing
to let go of our story.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Being willing to.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.921 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Being willing to.

00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to come back, we're

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:84%
going to find out
exactly how to do this.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Andrew's going to
take us through some

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of his teachings of the five
tenants of enlightenment

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
when we come back with
my guest Andrew Cohen.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.689 align:middle line:90%
We will be right back.

00:25:13.689 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr,
we'll be right back.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back, I'm
Lisa Garr and my guest

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
is cultural visionary
Andrew Cohen.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about
Evolutionary Enlightenment

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.519 align:middle line:10%
and how to achieve this
in a practical sense.

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that
the world is really

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.464 align:middle line:10%
ready for this conversation
about enlightenment?

00:25:51.464 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I think there are
tons of people in the world who

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
are, and there are
a lot who aren't.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It depends upon your
level of development.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I think this teaching
is really for people

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.367 align:middle line:84%
at the very leading edge
of cultural development.

00:26:01.367 --> 00:26:03.533 align:middle line:10%
That group of individuals
I call the luckiest people

00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:04.936 align:middle line:10%
that have ever been born.

00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:10%
I don't think--

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.544 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How so?

00:26:06.544 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: How so?

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.418 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The luckiest people
that have ever been born.

00:26:09.418 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, ever
since the 1960s

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
there's been with the
baby-boomer generation,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
with my generation, we've
come into the world,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
we've been recipients of the
highest levels of education.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
A standard of living that are
historically unprecedented.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.235 align:middle line:84%
Personal freedoms,
political freedoms.

00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of us can, more or less,
do anything that we imagine

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:90%
or that we want.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is historically
unprecedented.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We live lives that kings
and queens could not

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
have even imagined.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned that
the overall level of violence

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.401 align:middle line:84%
is down, globally,
and that there's

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:45.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different evidence
around that as well.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.525 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well that's, we're
talking about progress,

00:26:47.525 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
human progress, and
that's a different issue.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It's true that there's
less violence in the world

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.568 align:middle line:90%
than there's ever been.

00:26:53.568 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
There's less war, there's less
rape, there's less killing.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a book by the
Harvard psychologist Steven

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Pinker called, "The Better
Angels of our Nature."

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And he goes into a lot of detail
making the point that violence,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that human violence
of man on man,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.647 align:middle line:84%
that we are harming each
other less than we ever have.

00:27:12.647 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
most people don't know.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.418 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If that's not ever
a sign of human progress,

00:27:17.418 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and of cultural evolution,
and moral development,

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.625 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what is.

00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:22.916 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people seem to think
things are getting worse,

00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:90%
and it's not really true.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it seems
that's all we see and hear

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.447 align:middle line:84%
about in the news is killings,
and people dying and things

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:90%
getting worse.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.071 align:middle line:84%
It seems that there's more
awareness around that.

00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually less of
that going on, comparatively?

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.756 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Apparently,
much, much less.

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now
how does this have

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.311 align:middle line:84%
to do with us being the
luckiest people in the world?

00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I
guess what it would

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
have to do with that is that
you and I are living in an era

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
where, in this case, violence
has been on the decrease,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:84%
but most importantly, there are
literally millions and millions

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of us who are experiencing
a level of good fortune

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that's historically
unprecedented.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:84%
The problem is most of us
don't seem to feel very lucky

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and don't realize that we're the
luckiest people that have ever

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:90%
been born.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me,
shows that there's

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual crisis at
the level of culture,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
if someone who's very fortunate
doesn't feel fortunate.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And too many of us feel stressed
out and very victimized.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't really--
because if you know

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.423 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the luckiest
people that's ever been born,

00:28:24.423 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
you feel lucky,
you feel fortunate.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And also, if the most
fortunate among us,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, experience a sense
of obligation to all those

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
who aren't as
fortunate as we are.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sign of really
spiritual development

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.240 align:middle line:84%
for many of us to
recognize our good fortune

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and to stop being so
concerned about ourselves,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and to start being a
lot much more concerned

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:84%
about everybody else
and this big process

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're a part of.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that ultimately is
Evolutionary Enlightenment.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach that?

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.580 align:middle line:84%
What are the five tenets that
you talk about in your book?

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.254 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the five
fundamental principles

00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of how to put the
teaching into practice

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is the first one is
really organizing our life

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
around a very deep inquiry
into the question of what's

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
more important
than anything else?

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that the
evolution of consciousness

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution
of culture was more

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
important than
anything else to me.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.481 align:middle line:84%
And if we realize that the
evolution of consciousness

00:29:22.481 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution of culture
is more important than anything

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
else, we become very
focused on that.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
We organize our entire life
around the whole principle

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.500 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And evolution at the
level of culture, you see,

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:90%
is very interesting.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Because many of us are
really living in the past.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Culture is our shared ideas,
our shared values, our shared

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:90%
belief systems.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.789 align:middle line:84%
And when you embrace an
evolutionary worldview,

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
you're more interested
in where we're going

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.424 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
versus where we have been

00:29:51.424 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
or what other
people have told us.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:90%
We become very creative.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:90%
We become creative visionaries.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We become interested in
creating new possibilities,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:84%
not only for ourself,
but for everyone else.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We consider ourselves to be
Pathfinders, so co-creators

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.882 align:middle line:84%
with other people of
where we're going,

00:30:07.882 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:90%
not where we've already come.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So not paying so
much attention to history,

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at it as milestones,
but looking forward

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to creating something
out of nothing?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, no, no.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:84%
We can always only build on
what has already happened.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We can't wipe everything away
and go back to the beginning.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is we realize
history is not static.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And we suddenly realize
that there's not

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.360 align:middle line:84%
a divine being that exists
outside the time process that's

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:90%
guiding the process.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
At this particular
point in history

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:84%
we realize that where
we're going in the future

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:84%
depends upon the choices we
make and the actions we take.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
We are creating, you and I are
the energy and intelligence

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that created the universe
creating the future

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:90%
at the level of human culture.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin
to see that, we

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:84%
awaken beyond the small
and narrow confines

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of a small egoic psychological
perspective, a very personal

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing with
big eyes into the big future

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that if we're
so inspired, that it's

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:84%
our obligation to do
everything we can to create it.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We feel ourselves called to live
big lives for the sake of where

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:90%
we're all going together.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.024 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the first tenet
being the Power of Intention.

00:31:23.024 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The
intention to do that.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:84%
The intention to live
our life in relationship

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to do a very big
idea, to big ideas,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and to absolute
spiritual principles.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite of a very
small, very personalized

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:84%
worldview in relationship
to just my life.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
We live our life in relationship
to cosmic evolution,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to biological evolution,
to cultural evolution.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We see our life as
the leading edge

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:84%
of the whole process
right here and right now.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we become very concerned
with where we're all going.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Where we're all going depends
upon me, it depends upon you.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really have
time not to pay attention,

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.975 align:middle line:84%
and not to care about
where we're going

00:32:05.975 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and how we're
going to get there.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to make a
distinction, a lot of people

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.295 align:middle line:90%
are worried about survival.

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
survive global warming?

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to survive
the economic crisis?

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And those are
important questions,

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.520 align:middle line:84%
but even if-- just to
imagine for a moment

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that the crisis
of global warming

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.930 align:middle line:84%
was somehow magically solved,
and even imagine for a moment

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that our economic crisis was
solved-- in terms of where

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:84%
we're all going at the level
of culture and shared values,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that question wouldn't
have been answered yet.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So some of us have to
be concerned not just

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:84%
about survival-- how are
we going to survive--

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:84%
but how are we actually
going to evolve and develop

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:90%
at the level of culture?

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very big and
very exciting question.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A very exciting
question is a key point to that.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It is very exciting to
go into that direction.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And that takes us
to the next tenet,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
which is that volition,
that power of volition

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:90%
moving forward.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well the Law of
Volition is all about choices.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And in other words,
if we want to be

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
a spiritually
liberated individual

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.966 align:middle line:84%
we have to come to that
point in our own development

00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
where we stop blaming anybody
else for our predicament.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
We cease to experience
ourselves as being victims.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who's been
born has, in some way,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:84%
been hurt, and wounded,
and traumatized

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:90%
by another or others.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:21.016 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
obviously more than others.

00:33:21.016 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
be free we have

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.848 align:middle line:84%
to accept responsibility for
the consequences of everything

00:33:24.848 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that's ever happened
to us and realize

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:90%
it's all my own predicament.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
We take full responsibility
for our own karmic predicament.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's my problem, it's
not anybody else's.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Goodness, explain that.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
You taking full responsibility
for your karmic predicament.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, because
our karmic predicament

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:90%
tends to be very complex.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Because who we are is
we're very complex beings.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We're all a product of--
there's biological history.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
There's my personal
family history.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jewish, so
part of my history

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
has to do with my
ethnic background.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
other dimensions

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:84%
of all the different
ways we're conditioned.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that we have
to be responsible for if we want

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to become
masters of our own destiny.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
victims of history

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:84%
we want to become masters
of our own destiny.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:84%
In order to do
that, we have to be

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
willing to heroically take
complete responsibility

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.679 align:middle line:84%
for everything that's made
us the person we are now,

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and then decide who we want to
be and make those choices that

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.290 align:middle line:84%
will make it possible for
us to become that person.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.496 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So basically taking
complete responsibility

00:34:30.496 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:84%
for everything that's ever
happened to us and moving onto

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
the next--

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Endeavour to do that.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:37.454 align:middle line:90%
It's a heroic aspiration.

00:34:37.454 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a whole show.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's being
willing to nobly embrace

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:90%
the totality of our being.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And we will often
fail doing so, but we

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
need to at least try to take
that much responsibility

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:59.337 align:middle line:84%
for who we are, and how we
are, and who we want to be.

00:34:59.337 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I like how
you move it forward

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and not getting stuck
into that place of pain,

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:90%
but moving forward.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:90%
So that will then take us--

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, an
evolutionary orientation

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
is always about what can
be, never about what is.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
An evolutionary orientation
is always about what can be,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:90%
never about what is.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not so much
about the power of now,

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:84%
being in this
moment, present time?

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.792 align:middle line:90%
It's more about the next moment?

00:35:22.792 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: In what I call the
traditional enlightenment

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is about being in
the present moment.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
In an evolutionary orientation
to liberation and to life,

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
it's always about
the next moment.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense, the
present moment is already here.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We've always already
arrived in the present.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we can't
really change anything now,

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.390 align:middle line:84%
but we can affect change in
what hasn't happened yet.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
this orientation

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.749 align:middle line:84%
it's always, always
future-oriented.

00:35:48.749 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
place, through volition,

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:90%
we can actually affect change.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The next tenet, I see,
is more about authenticity.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I find this a very
interesting one.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It is Face Everything
and Avoid Nothing.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well facing everything,
avoiding nothing is, I feel,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
the most challenging, and
really the highest and most

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
profound form of
spiritual practice, which

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:90%
is the practice of awareness.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And the practice of awareness
in all the great enlightenment

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:84%
traditions is really the way
to become an enlightened person

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.720 align:middle line:84%
is through the choice, or making
the effort to be more aware.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we can say, well,
most of us face very little

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and avoid a lot.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Or face nothing and
avoid everything.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why do we do that?

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because
reality is hard to take.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And because we have the images
about who we are and often

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:84%
they're very different
from how we actually are.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And because we tend to
be very, very sensitive,

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:90%
very narcissistic.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We often can't, we
find it unbearable

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.825 align:middle line:90%
to see ourselves more clearly.

00:36:50.825 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you want to
be free and you want to evolve,

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
continue to develop,

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:84%
we're not so afraid
of seeing the truth

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to
remain simply as we are now.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly
striving to evolve

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to become more of
who we could be.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
do that, we have

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:90%
to remove all the obstacles.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
fundamental obstacles

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is we're unconscious
of our motivations.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Often the left hand doesn't know
what the right hand is doing.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So we want to become
very conscious

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.384 align:middle line:84%
of what's making us tick, of why
we're doing what we're doing.

00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:24.341 align:middle line:84%
Why we're making the
choices that we're making.

00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, we have to
be willing to make the effort

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:31.260 align:middle line:84%
to become a lot more
conscious than we tend to be.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.355 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, we're
going to remove the obstacles

00:37:34.355 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:90%
to our own potential to evolve.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we face
everything and avoid nothing,

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:90%
does that get rid of judgment?

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:48.352 align:middle line:84%
Is judgment considered
avoidance, basically?

00:37:48.352 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it all depends
on what you mean by judgment.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that a big
part of higher development

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:90%
is learning how to discriminate.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Intelligent
discrimination, learning

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:90%
how to make distinctions.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So some people think if you make
any distinctions between one

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:84%
individual and another,
one quality and another,

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:84%
if you make value
judgments, they

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
feel there's something
unspiritual or something

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
inherently negative about it.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But I don't actually
think that's true.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Part of higher
development is learning

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.221 align:middle line:84%
discernment, the
art of discernment.

00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:20.428 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're going to
learn the art of discernment

00:38:20.428 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:90%
we have to make value judgments.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part, I
think, of higher development.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think learning how to
make accurate and truthful

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
judgments, or
value distinctions,

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:84%
is a big part of
higher development.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.908 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
we have to learn

00:38:37.908 --> 00:38:41.046 align:middle line:84%
how to do with greater and
greater degrees of accuracy,

00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and precision, and insight.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you give
me an example of that?

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
How do you, in your live, face
everything and avoid nothing?

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, to
be-- I don't think

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to face
everything and avoid nothing,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.037 align:middle line:84%
but we want to strive to face
everything and avoid nothing.

00:38:58.037 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do
that because evolution

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:90%
is about development in time.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
lifetime, we only

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
have a certain amount of
time to evolve and develop.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So we want to use
the time we have

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in the most productive
manner possible.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to waste
time, because time

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
is all we have from an
evolutionary point of view.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we want to
be very aware of what we're

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
doing, what's motivating us to
make the choices that we make,

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be sure that
the choices that we make

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:84%
are in alignment with our
highest ideals and aspirations.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see, that
makes it connect.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:84%
That completely connects it
to the power of volition,

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.250 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, the intention.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the next
tenet that you talk about--

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and these are tenets.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.467 align:middle line:90%
Tenets are just guidelines.

00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:46.800 align:middle line:84%
These are things that you're
striving and achieving to--

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.187 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it's a
spiritual context for living.

00:39:52.187 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of, what's the
context in which most of us

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:54.870 align:middle line:90%
are living?

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.985 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, I
don't really know.

00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:58.193 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of I want
this, and I don't want that.

00:39:58.193 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know but what's
the context, the picture,

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the big picture in which
your life is lived?

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.295 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
people are members

00:40:05.295 --> 00:40:07.979 align:middle line:84%
of some of the great mythic
religious traditions,

00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:09.020 align:middle line:90%
there's a meta narrative.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a big picture
which frames and helps

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to orient life and
the way it's lived.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us who grew up
in a secular culture, a secular

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.910 align:middle line:84%
context, we haven't been
given these big meta

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
narratives in which
to frame our lives.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately
for us, it's really

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.690 align:middle line:84%
come down to what's going
to make me feel good?

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Life is all about me.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no moral, philosophical,
or spiritual context for life.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to make
getting somewhere big

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and profound very difficult.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It takes the what's
in it for me out of it.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.397 align:middle line:84%
So the Process Perspective
is the fourth tenet.

00:40:43.397 --> 00:40:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
Process Perspective

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.621 align:middle line:84%
is a very big part of an
evolutionary orientation

00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Because once again,
we're all part

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of a cosmic process that
had a beginning in time

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:90%
14 billion years ago.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.795 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to understand
that when there was the Big

00:40:58.795 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Bang, there was a big cosmic
explosion of energy and light,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and matter emerged from nothing.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then miraculously,
from energy and matter,

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:90%
life emerged.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And from life, eventually,
human consciousness

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and human culture.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So when we realize
that, we realize

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that my capacity for
consciousness, and cognition,

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and thought, and subjectivity,
and self-reflective awareness

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
is the product of this deep
time developmental processes,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I realize that my
body, that my mind,

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and my personality has all been
created by this cosmic process,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.090 align:middle line:84%
by this biological process,
by this cultural process.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It's one process, they're
not many processes

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
from this perspective.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:84%
There's one process
that has given rise,

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and is giving rise
to all of this.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that, you
begin to take your own life

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.340 align:middle line:90%
less personally.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:00.726 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see the
process in everything.

00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
Process Perspective.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The process of evolution that
we have gone through and that--

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You see every aspect
of your own personal life,

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and of everything that's
happening in the world,

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:84%
as a product of a
cosmic unfolding.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Not as discreet as the
discrete personal event,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or as some isolated
cultural event.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.289 align:middle line:84%
But you see everything is in
one way or another related

00:42:23.289 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:90%
to everything else.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It's what they say
in Mahayana Buddhism,

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.925 align:middle line:84%
it's similar with the law
of dependent origination.

00:42:28.925 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything that exists
depends upon everything else

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:90%
that exists.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is basically
taking this nonduality theme

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:84%
again and saying that
we are not separate.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't take what we have, our own
experience personally-- which

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely love-- and see
everything as evolutionary.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
it's true through.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
that you could see

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and everything you can
see, taste, smell, touch,

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and imagination is all
part of this one process

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that's unfolding and
that's going somewhere.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
realize that and you

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:84%
realize that nothing
is separate and there

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
anything being separate,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:90%
it liberates you from your ego.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So some of our
Facebook questions coming in,

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:84%
which are great, is
where do politics

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:90%
fit in with your message?

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
politics and governance

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:middle line:84%
have been and continue to be a
product of cultural evolution.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So throughout
human history we've

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:84%
learned ways to organize
ourselves and our relationships

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:84%
with each other in ways
that will make it possible

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
for us to work together in
greater and greater unity.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we can take-- well,
I've heard many times

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that the power is being put back
into the hands of the people

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our evolution.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken with many people
about the personal empowerment

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of politics, and where we're
able to create movements.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And the internet is able to
connect us in a deeper level

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and create things
like the Arab Spring.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So in taking these
types of-- this

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is basically the evolution
of politics, if you will.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, we're facing
enormous difficulties

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:84%
in our own political
system right now.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.792 align:middle line:84%
And it's very frustrating and
not satisfying for many of us,

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.500 align:middle line:84%
me included, because
the system right now

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:90%
isn't working very well for us.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we want to
look at the whole evolution

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:84%
of the political system in
relationship to human history,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.989 align:middle line:84%
we are living in a much
more civilized world because

00:44:35.989 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of our
political systems and emergence

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.650 align:middle line:84%
of our political systems
than ever before.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:84%
If you go back in 1,000
years to 2,000 years ago,

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.480 align:middle line:84%
the world was a much more
dangerous and uncivilized place

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:90%
to live in.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So the system in this country
right now is not working,

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite
dysfunctional compared

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to how many of us think
it should be working.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But the political
system, these are

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:84%
ways in which we can learn
how to work together and live

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:90%
together democratically.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a system in which the
rights and needs of individuals

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.050 align:middle line:84%
are, at least to
profound degrees,

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.420 align:middle line:90%
being recognized and honored.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And so if we see the system
that we have in relationship

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to history, we see
how far we've come.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.675 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we don't
have a long way to go.

00:45:26.675 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, right.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: We have
a long way to go

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because we want things to be
much better than they are now.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But we want to see
that our capacity

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to become more
and more civilized

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.097 align:middle line:84%
is continuing to
evolve and develop.

00:45:39.097 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So it goes along
with the fifth tenet,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.477 align:middle line:84%
which is the cosmic
consciousness.

00:45:44.477 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Cosmic conscious.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Conscience, sorry.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Cosmic conscience
is a shift of identity.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And the shift of
identity from my identity

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:56.000 align:middle line:84%
from the personal
ego-- I am merely

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:84%
my psychological self--
to realizing that who I am

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is not separate from the
energy and intelligence that

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.340 align:middle line:84%
created the universe and
is creating the universe.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.594 align:middle line:90%
That's who I really am.

00:46:06.594 --> 00:46:08.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the energy
and intelligence

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that's animating this mind and
body in the form of the mind,

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
body, and personality,
in my case, of Andrew.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.830 align:middle line:84%
In your case, the mind, body,
and personality of Lisa.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.775 align:middle line:84%
But the energy that's
driving Lisa, the energy

00:46:21.775 --> 00:46:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence that's driving
Lisa, the creative energy

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence
that's driving Lisa

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.511 align:middle line:84%
is the same creative
energy and intelligence

00:46:28.511 --> 00:46:30.510 align:middle line:84%
that's driving Andrew,
that's driving all of us,

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that's animating the
process and compelling

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.520 align:middle line:84%
us to want to evolve,
to want to develop,

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.870 align:middle line:84%

Unburdened by the
weight of existence

00:48:01.405 --> 00:48:04.122 align:middle line:10%
you could not have
been more content.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:19.030 align:middle line:10%
Yet, for some reason, out
of that perfect contentment

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.365 align:middle line:10%
you made a decision
to create the cosmos.

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:10%


00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.560 align:middle line:10%
You chose to manifest
a material universe

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:10%
from your own
unmanifest emptiness.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.280 align:middle line:10%
You could have continued
to rest happily

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:10%
in being, meditating
on nothingness

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:10%
for more countless eons
of infinite no time.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.855 align:middle line:10%
But you had already
done that, forever.

00:48:45.855 --> 00:48:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.360 align:middle line:10%
So you chose to take the
unthinkable step and endeavour

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.638 align:middle line:10%
to manifest your own
self in and through form.

00:48:59.638 --> 00:49:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:10%
Where did that choice come from?

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:10%
Where in that empty
perfection would the impetus

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:22.140 align:middle line:10%
arise to do something so vast,
so complex, so overwhelming?

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.640 align:middle line:10%
What could be a
greater challenge

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.040 align:middle line:10%
than to create something
out of nothing?

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.500 align:middle line:10%
To manifest the material
universe before form

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.565 align:middle line:10%
had ever existed?

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.120 align:middle line:10%
But you apparently decided to
take that unimaginable step.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:10%
How do I know?

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.860 align:middle line:10%
Because it's happening.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:10%
Because we are here, now, 14
billion years later reflecting

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:10%
on this very question.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And considering the fact
that at the deepest level

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:06.170 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness itself
there is only one.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.420 align:middle line:10%
And that one is
who you always are.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:10%
You would have to conclude
that at every step of the way,

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.560 align:middle line:10%
from before the
beginning and infinite

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.740 align:middle line:10%

the choice to take

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.670 align:middle line:10%
the plunge from
formlessness into form,

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and up until the present
moment, it could only be you,

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.646 align:middle line:10%
and bring them into the
modern and postmodern world,

00:51:32.646 --> 00:51:34.140 align:middle line:10%
we have to really
begin to rethink

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.473 align:middle line:10%
what enlightenment is all about.

00:51:35.473 --> 00:51:38.245 align:middle line:10%
So for the first 12
years or so, the magazine

00:51:38.245 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:10%
was, what is enlightenment?

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I was asking
many questions.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.864 align:middle line:84%
To me it was a journey
of inquiry for me.

00:51:44.864 --> 00:51:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we changed the name
eventually to "EnlightenNext"

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
because this is when I really
had discovered evolution

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and the evolutionary context
for existence and, ultimately

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual liberation.

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we called
it "EnlightenNext"

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:58.200 align:middle line:84%
which means the
next enlightenment.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now
the next generation

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.100 align:middle line:90%
is you can be found online.

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And all of this--

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, absolutely, yes.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're doing
this through blogging

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.715 align:middle line:84%
and constant blogs
and dialogues.

00:52:06.715 --> 00:52:08.798 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I want to
get the message out there

00:52:08.798 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's so positive
and it can really

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.474 align:middle line:84%
help people to discover a
source of meaning and purpose

00:52:13.474 --> 00:52:15.515 align:middle line:84%
that can really change
their lives in ways that I

00:52:15.515 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:90%
don't think other things can.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very exciting.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is very exciting.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what is your
ultimate goal with all of this?

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:90%
What do you hope for us?

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I want to,
with other people,

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to help to create a
cultural revolution.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Because we're stuck, culturally.

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Those of us at the leading
edge of postmodern culture

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.020 align:middle line:84%
are stuck in a cul-de-sac in
terms of where we're going,

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:84%
how do we make sense
out of all this?

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm interested in,
with other people,

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:84%
creating-- you know it only
took 1,000 people to cause

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.437 align:middle line:84%
the Renaissance to happen, and
that was a cultural revolution.

00:52:50.437 --> 00:52:52.645 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need now is
a new cultural revolution.

00:52:52.645 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think this whole new
big idea about evolution,

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and a cultural evolution,
and spiritual evolution

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.610 align:middle line:84%
which is about
creating the future,

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and consciously creating the
future with other people,

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.276 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm really
interested in.

00:53:09.276 --> 00:53:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have done that today.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
you being here.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.206 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you've sat with--

00:53:14.206 --> 00:53:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's been my
pleasure, and my honor.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, my honor.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you've sat
with amazing people

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and had incredible dialogues.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And to have this
experience with you

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.790 align:middle line:84%
has been uplifting
and inspirational.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.549 align:middle line:90%
And I just really appreciate it.

00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, thank you.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you,
thank you so much.
