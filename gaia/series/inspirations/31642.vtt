>> Lisa Garr: Hi I'm Lisa Garr
host of Gaiam Inspiration.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.992 align:middle line:84%
My guest today Ron Teeguarden
is well known as the father

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:28.395 align:middle line:84%
of the tonic herbal movement in
America, and has been teaching

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.931 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient wisdom of
Chinese tonic herbs in America

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
since the early '70's,
and we're very lucky

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.738 align:middle line:84%
to have Ron Teeguarden join us
today to share his knowledge

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.808 align:middle line:84%
and give us a glimpse
into his vast travels.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.944 align:middle line:84%
Ron has traveled to some of
the most exotic locations

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.881 align:middle line:84%
to find some of the highest
quality herbs in the world

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.283 align:middle line:84%
for longevity and
radiant health.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.684 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Oh it's great
to be here [laughter] thank you.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Great
to have you here.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:57.191 align:middle line:84%
So what started you on your path
to learn about Chinese herbs?

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well at the
beginning it was my health.

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:03.998 align:middle line:84%
I was in college and -- at
the University of Michigan

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:05.799 align:middle line:84%
and I was burning the
candle at every end.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.637 align:middle line:84%
I was on an athletic scholarship
but also trying to be a doctor,

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:13.807 align:middle line:84%
you know, pre-med and it was
the '60's so I was doing all

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that kind of stuff and I just
burned myself out pretty badly

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.179 align:middle line:84%
over a period of four
or five years of,

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
as I said burning the candle.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.117 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point I just
kind of -- my health collapsed.

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:25.853 align:middle line:84%
I developed kind of a
chronic fatigue syndrome

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.153 align:middle line:90%
and I was looking for things.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:31.724 align:middle line:84%
I got into organic food and
then herbs and eventually,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.095 align:middle line:84%
the tonic herbs came my
way by amazing good fortune

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.998 align:middle line:84%
and I just developed
such an interest in it.

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.099 align:middle line:84%
but they were hard to get so
I hard to start finding them,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.902 align:middle line:84%
and once I started finding
them and sharing them

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:84%
with other people it just became
kind of a benevolent cycle

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:48.108 align:middle line:84%
of taking care of my own
health and really over a couple

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.044 align:middle line:84%
of years getting
really healthy from that

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time I
started, you know, teaching it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.916 align:middle line:84%
and getting the herbs and giving
them to my friends and so forth.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well you
definitely took a liking to it.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now when
you say they came your way

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
by good fortune was it
a doctor or -- how...

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
in the beginning I got

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.629 align:middle line:84%
into macrobiotics which
was kind of Asian based

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.498 align:middle line:84%
and so I met some
oriental doctors

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.801 align:middle line:84%
and some acupuncturists
before acupuncture was legal

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.006 align:middle line:84%
So I was introduced to some
herbs and then I just --

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.175 align:middle line:84%
I start -- I had a knack
for finding teachers

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:23.777 align:middle line:90%
who were sort of underground.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:27.281 align:middle line:84%
This was the early '70's
and they -- it was --

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.017 align:middle line:84%
just I started going into
Korea town, and Japan town

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle line:84%
and China town and
meeting people.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:32.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh okay.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So I just
started getting into it.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.523 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing thing
once you get going so.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So it went
so well in your body

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
that you decided to pursue it.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:41.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
went to China and...

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
I didn't go to China yet.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.134 align:middle line:84%
At that point I was lucky
enough to have China come to me.

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:50.104 align:middle line:84%
As I said there were
great masters living

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:53.907 align:middle line:84%
around who were not practicing
in any kind of legal way so I...

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:54.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Here
in Los Angeles?

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yeah so I just would --

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:59.146 align:middle line:84%
you know met one and then
another and it just kind

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.349 align:middle line:84%
of became my passion and I
just started apprenticing

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.751 align:middle line:84%
with a few different
people and...

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:04.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Very smart.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.086 align:middle line:90%
So you found some mentors.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: We have a
picture of one of the mentors

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:90%
that you started with.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Right.

00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:11.692 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Who
is this gentleman?

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well my --
he became my greatest teacher.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
That's Daoist Master
Sung Gin Park.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.801 align:middle line:84%
He was from Korea and he
came here for a short time

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.939 align:middle line:84%
for a mission of training
some people to teach Daoism.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.011 align:middle line:84%
And I had seen a book by him a
couple years earlier and just

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.514 align:middle line:84%
by complete coincidence he
came to town and I saw an ad

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
in the little throw away
newspaper for his class

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.754 align:middle line:84%
and I went to it and only
one other person showed up

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:44.091 align:middle line:84%
and he had us stand on our
-- when we walked in he said,

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:84%
"Here stand on your
head against the wall."

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So we
both stood on our head

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.596 align:middle line:84%
against the wall and
then he left [laughter].

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
And then after about 15
minutes the guy next to me said,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.369 align:middle line:84%
"Forget this," in a
little more graphic terms.

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Got
down and walked out

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.672 align:middle line:84%
and then Master Park
came into me --

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.608 align:middle line:84%
back into the room and
said, "Okay, you're the one.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.111 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to," he
said, "I need you

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:07.281 align:middle line:84%
to help me spread Daoism
throughout America and I'm going

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle line:90%
to make you my apprentice."

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.486 align:middle line:84%
And I just took a vow
that day and he turned

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.955 align:middle line:90%
out to the most amazing teacher.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.824 align:middle line:90%
His whole teaching was

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
about being pro-active
about your health.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
How to attain -- it was
the real deal like how

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.266 align:middle line:84%
to attain immortality, and
longevity, and radiant health,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.202 align:middle line:90%
and choose spiritual happiness.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.739 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me all about
the basic of the herbs

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
and the system of
Chinese Daoist herbalism

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.978 align:middle line:84%
so it was my amazing
fortune to study

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.013 align:middle line:90%
with him for several years.

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
more than fortunate.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:84%
He was like, this
is your purpose.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yes, it
was just -- it was my mission.

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.052 align:middle line:90%
It came to me.

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:46.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It
still is exactly the same.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Well great.

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: I
still work with him.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You have
created incredible things.

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:52.392 align:middle line:84%
So now your travels took
you all over the world

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.794 align:middle line:90%
but started in the early-70's.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.295 align:middle line:90%
We have a picture of you in --

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:84%
holding one of the
beautiful Ginseng herbs

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to learn about.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah I'm
wearing my I made it to the top

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:05.706 align:middle line:84%
of Chung Bine Mountain t-shirt
and [laughter] that was one

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.208 align:middle line:84%
of the roots that I
collected at the --

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.777 align:middle line:84%
up there on the top
of the mountain

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:14.415 align:middle line:90%
and I started in the mid-80's.

00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:17.084 align:middle line:84%
China hadn't really
opened up yet

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
but you get certain
permission and I was able

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.988 align:middle line:90%
to go a little bit in.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:25.692 align:middle line:84%
I started doing some trading
with China and met some people

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:26.894 align:middle line:90%
and at that point that's

00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.429 align:middle line:84%
when all the bicycles
were on the road.

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:29.863 align:middle line:84%
You know those images
of thousands,

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.298 align:middle line:90%
of millions of bicycles

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.934 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was still wearing
little [inaudible] outfits

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.502 align:middle line:90%
and it was very primitive.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, I mean literally, I --
I'm sort of grateful in my life

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.043 align:middle line:84%
that I got to see China
transform from that

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:46.113 align:middle line:84%
into the whole thing
that it's gone through.

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.749 align:middle line:84%
You know it's good
and bad but it --

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.884 align:middle line:84%
I saw this transition
of a civilization

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:52.119 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty amazing.

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.054 align:middle line:84%
But this was -- this
picture was taken back

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
when I brought home
a wild Ginseng root

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:90%
and it was just [inaudible].

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:01.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So when you travel
to those areas were you accepted

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.897 align:middle line:84%
or allowed in to those
particular areas?

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:06.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well in the
beginning it was very awkward.

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:12.473 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go anyplace
alone and I did --

00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:16.376 align:middle line:84%
I am the kind of person who
actually got away and got

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.246 align:middle line:90%
to walk streets or countryside

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:21.381 align:middle line:84%
on my own a little
bit, you know.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.851 align:middle line:90%
And but, you know, you --

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:27.287 align:middle line:84%
at that time you would attract a
100 people every place you went

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.356 align:middle line:84%
and nobody has every
seen a westerner before

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
so it was kind of
[laughter] crazy.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.392 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
anymore unless you really go

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:36.797 align:middle line:84%
to the remote mountains which,
you know, I've been going there

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:43.003 align:middle line:84%
for that's -- you know, 20 year
or so, more than that 30 years.

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah,
30 -- 35 years, yeah.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:45.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: There you go.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right yeah.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You
know, and, you know,

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:51.311 align:middle line:90%
you see a lot and things change.

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.947 align:middle line:84%
It's -- I've gone -- you
know, I've never actually gone

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.215 align:middle line:90%
on a vacation in China.

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:57.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, it took me a couple
of decades before I went

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.953 align:middle line:84%
and saw the Great Wall because
there was no herbs there.

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.655 align:middle line:90%
But I did get to go out --

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.457 align:middle line:84%
my mission was always to
go where the herbs are

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and people -- I'd meet people
who would take me to a mountain

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.096 align:middle line:84%
or to a desert or
something and that was my...

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: What an adventure.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So I got
inside of people's houses,

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
their little huts
and into villages.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
It was much more beautiful
than going on kind of tours.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh yeah.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
That type of thing.

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:19.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: This
photo we have is of you

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:20.541 align:middle line:90%
in the Kings Mountains?

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.875 align:middle line:90%
Is that what is was?

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well this
one's actually up in Bhutan.

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.278 align:middle line:90%
This is the Himalayas.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:28.882 align:middle line:84%
It's about 11,000 feet
up and I did get to --

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:30.918 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Bhutan six times.

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:34.254 align:middle line:84%
Bhutan's a Garden
of Eden paradise.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.622 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a country
where they say there --

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.025 align:middle line:84%
well there isn't
a stoplight yet.

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:43.697 align:middle line:84%
There's not stop signs, no
stoplights in Bhutan and it's a,

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:47.034 align:middle line:84%
it's a remarkably beautiful
and I've been fortunate enough

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.969 align:middle line:90%
to spend a good time there.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.739 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very good friend
who's a [inaudible] medic

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:54.141 align:middle line:90%
and he went -- he took me --

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:58.145 align:middle line:84%
he had permission to go onto the
King's private land and we went

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.446 align:middle line:90%
up to the King's private land

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.748 align:middle line:84%
and there was just
Ginseng growing everywhere

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:04.585 align:middle line:84%
and we picked a couple
of these Ginseng roots,

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.486 align:middle line:90%
and this is Himalayan Ginseng.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.256 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one
of the roots,

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:10.257 align:middle line:90%
you know, that he came with.

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.291 align:middle line:84%
It's a little different
shape than...

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That's a root?

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
It's Himalayan Ginseng.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:16.463 align:middle line:84%
It's different than the
Chinese or the American Ginseng

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:21.268 align:middle line:84%
but it was -- that's what I got
and you know pretty much ecstasy

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:24.571 align:middle line:84%
when you find a Ginseng root in
the mountains and [inaudible].

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:25.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
know what to look for.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now these are, these are
absolutely beautiful.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.677 align:middle line:90%
This is a giant Rishi mushroom.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah,

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.647 align:middle line:84%
well just to give you a
little bit better view.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: How old
is this particular?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: This
mushroom is probably six

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.493 align:middle line:84%
or seven years old and
I do have one or two,

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:50.264 align:middle line:84%
a couple that are a
couple hundred years old

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
but they were a little
too big and heavy...

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Rare.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:56.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...to
bring to the show here

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:59.973 align:middle line:84%
but we have them on display
in our various locations.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:02.376 align:middle line:90%
But this one's magnificent.

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:03.944 align:middle line:84%
It's been growing
for some years.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It shows that Reishi -- most
Reishi 's are one year old

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.217 align:middle line:84%
when people collect them and
harvest them and consume them.

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:14.921 align:middle line:84%
They grow -- people, some
people grow them in hot houses.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:18.025 align:middle line:84%
All of our Reishi's grow on
wooden logs up in the forest.

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:21.161 align:middle line:84%
They actually put the logs and
they inoculate them naturally

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:24.731 align:middle line:84%
like that and those will
grow for a season or two.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:28.835 align:middle line:84%
But Reishi will live as long
as the plant that's on it

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:32.439 align:middle line:84%
so I have a Reishi in my
office that's probably

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
about 200-years-old
that was growing

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.676 align:middle line:84%
on a tree called an
immortality tree.

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:38.912 align:middle line:84%
A tree that lives well
over a 1,000 years long.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:84%
So once the Reishi embeds
it grows year, after year,

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.151 align:middle line:84%
after year, so that's why
I have a 200-year-old...

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: My goodness.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's
practically a priceless Reishi.

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:49.656 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't want to cook
it and eat it or consume it,

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:51.758 align:middle line:84%
but maybe sometime when
I get really old and I'm

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.294 align:middle line:84%
in desperate shape [laughter]
I probably will say now's

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:54.861 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:55.562 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The time.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.466 align:middle line:84%
Is there any particular way
of telling what a higher grade

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:03.036 align:middle line:84%
or more potent Reishi
mushroom is?

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
There definitely is.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: There is?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You sort
of have to have, you know,

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.376 align:middle line:90%
the experience with it.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:12.079 align:middle line:84%
You know there's,
there's, there's a lot

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:15.982 align:middle line:84%
of inexpensive hothouse
Reishi around that's not --

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:20.053 align:middle line:84%
that's largely what you see and
it's not even really natural.

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:22.222 align:middle line:84%
It's grown on rice holes
and things like that.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:24.891 align:middle line:84%
All of our Reishi as I
said is grown on a log

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:29.096 align:middle line:84%
so they get pretty big,
and they're very colorful,

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:31.765 align:middle line:84%
and they're thick, and they
produce spores at the end

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.668 align:middle line:84%
of the season and those spores
are much more powerful even

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:90%
than the Reishi.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.738 align:middle line:84%
And we can get the
oil from the --

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:41.541 align:middle line:84%
I know that once David Wolfe was
on your show and he mentioned

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.376 align:middle line:84%
that he takes the
Reishi spore oil...

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, right.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...every
day, every morning and so do I.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.981 align:middle line:90%
It's a miraculous substance.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.417 align:middle line:84%
It's 700 times stronger
even than Reishi

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:53.487 align:middle line:84%
which is probably the
strongest immune modulating herb

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:54.254 align:middle line:90%
in the world and...

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:55.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I was going

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to ask you what are the
healing properties of a Reishi?

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So
Reishi is the most --

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:01.261 align:middle line:84%
it's really the ultimate
herb in the world.

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.431 align:middle line:84%
I hope it -- every one of
my clients takes Reishi.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:90%
We figure out a way to get it

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:07.234 align:middle line:84%
into your program
no matter what.

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.535 align:middle line:90%
One way or another.

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:11.238 align:middle line:84%
And I would take --
you can't go a day

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.806 align:middle line:84%
without taking Reishi
once you know about it.

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:84%
It's got 800 active
constituents all

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:18.712 align:middle line:84%
of which build your
immune system,

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:22.549 align:middle line:84%
strengthen your central nervous
system, strengthen your senses.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
It's considered in Asia to be
the primary longevity herb.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.157 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's called the
mushroom of immortality,

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:32.759 align:middle line:84%
because the concept
was you live so long.

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Like this is...

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Healthy.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:36.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
...this is a statue I got.

00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:38.064 align:middle line:84%
it's an old one, it's probably
about 100-years-old of --

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:84%
he's called the Herb King and,
you know, he's a famous guy

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.404 align:middle line:84%
who lives to be over a
100-years-old in rural history

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.573 align:middle line:84%
and this particular
one, has him showing --

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.775 align:middle line:84%
here's the Herb King holding
up a Reishi mushroom here.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:51.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Which is
very, very rare back then.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's --

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
well Reishi's were harder
to find in the wild.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.318 align:middle line:84%
Now they know how to
cultivate them but --

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.887 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] my situation
we have --

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:04.858 align:middle line:84%
we collect wild ones from
different places and...

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:05.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Around the world.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.461 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...we
also cultivate them.

00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:10.964 align:middle line:84%
Yeah for example this one, these
little Reishi's right here,

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
these are the kind that grow
around the Shaolin Temple

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.703 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very closely related
to the Shaolin Temple.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.271 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my favorite
places in the world.

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:21.408 align:middle line:84%
That's where both Zen Buddhism
and Kung Fu were invented.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh wow.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: 1,500
years ago and so there's lots

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.582 align:middle line:84%
of Reishi around
the Shaolin Temple

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:31.117 align:middle line:84%
and these little ones they're
prevalent at certain times

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.886 align:middle line:84%
of the year and they're
fantastic.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: They're small.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.654 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very different.

00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
They just small.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the same.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.424 align:middle line:90%
It's just...

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: They're the same?

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
It just grows --

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.127 align:middle line:84%
Reishi grows differently in
different environments and...

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh I see.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...on
different sides of the mountain.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.632 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- sort of like people
and from different places.

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:47.767 align:middle line:84%
We're just different
according to their history.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:51.238 align:middle line:84%
And this one over here,
this is a purple Reishi.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: This is the
most prized Reishi of them all.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.276 align:middle line:90%
It's called purple and it's --

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.346 align:middle line:84%
that's the same kind he
would be holding in here.

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.247 align:middle line:90%
The...

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:01.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh okay, I see.

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
...purple Reishi.

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the king of the
Reishi mushrooms and very,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.885 align:middle line:90%
very hard -- this one's wild.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The kings Reishi.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:06.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
It's very hard to find

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:10.223 align:middle line:90%
so this is something we can get.

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:14.227 align:middle line:84%
We, we found it just a year ago
in a ravine in central China

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:17.264 align:middle line:84%
and the, the person who
found them contacted us

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:19.833 align:middle line:84%
because we're kind of
well-known and we extracted it

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.167 align:middle line:84%
and now we can get
purple Reishi.

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now what is this
beautiful and quite heavy.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.272 align:middle line:90%
That is heavy.

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:26.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah
this is -- well you can --

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.374 align:middle line:90%
this is a Cistanche stem.

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.709 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
root and the stem.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's
about five pounds.

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It
actually goes like this.

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:37.684 align:middle line:84%
No this is the root and
actually that's the stem.

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.686 align:middle line:84%
Comes up above the
ground like that.

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:41.655 align:middle line:84%
So you can see where
the cutoff line is here.

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:44.057 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
-- this is a big one.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:47.494 align:middle line:84%
This one cost me more
than a $1,000 for this.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.695 align:middle line:90%
Part of it broke off.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:84%
It was a little bit longer
but the -- this is --

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.601 align:middle line:84%
it's from Mongolia and
where it's the most --

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:57.037 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the most famous
what they Yong tonics.

00:13:57.037 --> 00:14:00.073 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a
sexual tonic for men.

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.374 align:middle line:90%

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:02.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Women
can take it too [laughter].

00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:04.678 align:middle line:84%
And this was the -- it's
very famous as the herb

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.681 align:middle line:84%
that Genghis Khan consumed
every single day as his tonic.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.215 align:middle line:90%
You know, like some kings they

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.284 align:middle line:84%
like Ginseng and
some like Reishi.

00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:12.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
Genghis Khan took Cistanche.

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.255 align:middle line:90%
This desert...

00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:17.557 align:middle line:90%

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:84%

was the most prolific man

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.729 align:middle line:84%
He -- and he's still got
the largest gene pool

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:23.596 align:middle line:90%
on the planet...

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.531 align:middle line:90%

...for one man.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:84%
So that just tells a story
without having to tell a story.

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:28.435 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:28.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Exactly.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:29.936 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:30.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
And it's a prized herb

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:31.571 align:middle line:90%
to say the least [laughter].

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:32.973 align:middle line:90%
It's popular, they're popular.

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.976 align:middle line:84%

very popular herb and it has --

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
it's very well-known but we
don't know enough about it

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.748 align:middle line:84%
so you put together
a beautiful video

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:42.849 align:middle line:90%
that tells us a little more.

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:43.717 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:90%

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:01.167 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese herbal
thoughts we call De Dao

of "the way" and
De means "earth".

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:09.275 align:middle line:84%

from an authentic location

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.044 align:middle line:90%
like there's -- like every herb,

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.046 align:middle line:84%

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:21.287 align:middle line:84%

the head master there and said,

"We're a De Dao company."

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.956 align:middle line:84%
He goes, "Oh, we're a
De Dao company too."

And he's at the Shaolin
Temple, you know,

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.127 align:middle line:84%
so because De Dao means
you're getting things

00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:29.262 align:middle line:90%
from the right place.

00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:31.164 align:middle line:84%

Ginseng, Chinese Ginseng comes

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:43.476 align:middle line:90%
from Chung Bi Mountain.

It's a volcano in Manchuria
that's an amazing place

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:51.851 align:middle line:90%
for herbs.

00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.987 align:middle line:84%
It actually continues
-- it has a lake with --

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:56.856 align:middle line:84%
there water is very,
very mineral

00:20:56.856 --> 00:20:59.559 align:middle line:84%
and it's a certain composition
coming from the center

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:03.162 align:middle line:84%
of the earth and that flows down
in rivers into off the mountain.

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:90%
So the entire side

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.399 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain has
got this unique once

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:09.936 align:middle line:84%
in the world chemistry of
the minerals that are coming

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:10.903 align:middle line:84%
out form the center
of the earth...

00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:11.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting.

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:12.672 align:middle line:90%
We have a picture of it here.

00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:13.506 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at it.

00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:14.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: That's it.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:14.841 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:16.175 align:middle line:90%
It's very salty.

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't swim in it or anything
like that and it's flowing

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.315 align:middle line:84%
down in big rivers down into
huge waterfalls and rivers.

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:25.017 align:middle line:84%
And that's where -- so
Ginseng evolved there.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So did Reishi mushroom
in the first place.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.458 align:middle line:84%
Ginseng is as a plant
that's 65 million year old.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:35.661 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the oldest
plants that we still get.

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:38.698 align:middle line:90%
It -- so it's very ancient.

00:21:38.698 --> 00:21:41.868 align:middle line:84%
It has adapted to a multitude
of environments right.

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:44.437 align:middle line:84%
65 million years; it's
survived for that long.

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:47.673 align:middle line:84%
So you think it's got some
kind of power to adapt.

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And that power to adapt is
built into its chemistry.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.346 align:middle line:84%
Every time it's like
challenged by the weather,

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:55.882 align:middle line:84%
or by a nematode, or
a bug, or anything,

00:21:55.882 --> 00:22:00.052 align:middle line:84%
it produces chemicals
called saponins or genocides

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:03.823 align:middle line:84%
that make it stronger so
it can handle the stress.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:09.462 align:middle line:84%
And when we consume that Ginseng
then we get those chemicals

00:22:09.462 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and we become more adaptive.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
That's where Ginseng, so
great Ginseng makes you able

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to handle much more
stress, much more difficulty

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in your life easily and
actually overcome it.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's what
an adaptogenic herb is.

00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:24.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Right.

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:25.711 align:middle line:84%
That's -- so adaptogenic
herbs are herbs

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:28.614 align:middle line:84%
that have a certain kind of
chemistry that help you adapt

00:22:28.614 --> 00:22:32.218 align:middle line:84%
to -- like, if it becomes
hot or cold, or like some

00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:34.187 align:middle line:84%
of the adapt -- like
this herb that comes

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
from Tibet called
Rhodiola, and every night

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.991 align:middle line:90%
and day the temperature changes

00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:41.294 align:middle line:84%
about 60 degrees
from night to day.

00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:45.998 align:middle line:84%
And that plant which is growing
above the snowline has to adapt

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:48.668 align:middle line:84%
to that kind of -- how would
we do if we were naked standing

00:22:48.668 --> 00:22:51.137 align:middle line:84%
up there trying to change
60 degrees in one day.

00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:52.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:53.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
But it can do it.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.607 align:middle line:84%
So when we consume that
it's got a certain chemistry

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:57.076 align:middle line:84%
that it helps us to
actually adapt to --

00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and many of the greatest
tonic herbs and adaptogenics.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.482 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are.

00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:04.217 align:middle line:84%
All -- a matter of
fact the majority

00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:08.588 align:middle line:84%
of the tonic herbs
are the adaptogenic.

00:23:08.588 --> 00:23:10.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So they
help your body to adapt

00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:12.792 align:middle line:84%
to various environments in
your life, in your world.

00:23:12.792 --> 00:23:14.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Right and
to the stress of the office,

00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:16.329 align:middle line:90%
or to the stress of traffic.

00:23:16.329 --> 00:23:19.765 align:middle line:84%
We're like -- evolving new
stressed but the body handles it

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.768 align:middle line:84%
in the same kind of way
by keeping your hormones

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.037 align:middle line:84%
in balance, by keeping your
nervous system in balance

00:23:25.037 --> 00:23:27.773 align:middle line:84%
and that's what happens when
you take adaptogenic herbs.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.041 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing...

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:30.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Fascinating.

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
...natural thing.

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So now what we
saw in the Ginseng video was

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.547 align:middle line:90%
about the rings in the Ginseng.

00:23:34.547 --> 00:23:38.751 align:middle line:84%
And is it the more -- the older
ones are those considered more

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
valuable potency?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.621 align:middle line:90%
Is that why?

00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:42.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Well Ginseng is --

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Ginseng, the best
Ginseng is wild.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a protected
species so it's, you know,

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.661 align:middle line:90%
it's limited so it's rare.

00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:52.999 align:middle line:90%
And so wild Ginseng will live --

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:57.904 align:middle line:84%
when it becomes about
15-years-old it's the --

00:23:57.904 --> 00:24:00.039 align:middle line:84%
what they call the death
domain of its genetics,

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:02.808 align:middle line:84%
the region of genes
that make something age

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.911 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly die; it turns off.

00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.179 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point Ginseng
becomes almost immortal.

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:84%
Ginseng roots will live almost
200 or 300 hundred years old.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:11.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: My goodness.

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You know,
years until they're eaten

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:15.755 align:middle line:84%
by a deer, you know, a human
find it or something like that.

00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:16.889 align:middle line:90%
They'll continue to live.

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:18.457 align:middle line:90%
They just stop dying.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:84%
So that chemistry
is what we want.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:23.663 align:middle line:90%
We want the oldest roots.

00:24:23.663 --> 00:24:24.931 align:middle line:90%
Like one of the Ginseng roots

00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:29.168 align:middle line:84%
in that video sold
for I think $400,000.

00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:30.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh my.

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:31.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: I think
it was 250-years-old.

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:33.139 align:middle line:84%
It sold for $400,000
in Hong Kong.

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:90%
And this is a wild Ginseng root.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.643 align:middle line:84%
More or less you
would call it typical

00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:40.746 align:middle line:84%
but it's really quite a
rare thing in the world.

00:24:40.746 --> 00:24:42.515 align:middle line:90%
It has the...

00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:43.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Rings.

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...the rings.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.319 align:middle line:84%
Each ring is kind
of like a mark of,

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:49.088 align:middle line:90%
you know, growth and fighting.

00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:51.657 align:middle line:84%
And a good Ginseng will
have little marks on it

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:84%
where things were nibbling
at it like down here.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.263 align:middle line:84%
That stimulated its
chemistry you see.

00:24:57.263 --> 00:25:00.299 align:middle line:84%
And then the head, this
part here, the head;

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:02.635 align:middle line:84%
each one of those notches
represents a year of life.

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.737 align:middle line:84%
So this Ginseng root
is about 30-years-old.

00:25:04.737 --> 00:25:05.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh my goodness.

00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:07.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
So this is a great --

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:11.077 align:middle line:84%
it's lived for 30 years in
Manchurian Mountains on its own

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.212 align:middle line:90%
until somebody found it.

00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:14.347 align:middle line:90%
Okay now...

00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And then
at the top as it comes

00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:17.617 align:middle line:84%
out of the earth
is that red flower.

00:25:17.617 --> 00:25:19.018 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Every, every
season out of the notch a new --

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:84%
the stem will come
up and produce leaves

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and then the little flo- --

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.626 align:middle line:84%
the seeds and so
forth and the flower.

00:25:26.626 --> 00:25:29.128 align:middle line:84%
And that of course
is -- they hide.

00:25:29.128 --> 00:25:33.399 align:middle line:90%
Ginseng is a hiding plant.

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:35.735 align:middle line:84%
That's one of its
techniques for surviving.

00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:37.803 align:middle line:84%
It's got many -- I could tell
you many of the different --

00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:39.672 align:middle line:84%
it's got tricks up its
sleeve like are unbelievable

00:25:39.672 --> 00:25:42.642 align:middle line:84%
but one thing it does is
it hides under other plants

00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:45.945 align:middle line:84%
and when animals come around it
hides around plants that tend

00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to move and cover it up so it's
very hard to find wild Ginseng.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.451 align:middle line:90%
It's almost...

00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:53.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's survival of
the fittest [laughter] Ginseng.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:55.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's 65
million years of survival.

00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:59.492 align:middle line:84%
Now this is cultivated
Ginseng and this is also

00:25:59.492 --> 00:26:00.526 align:middle line:90%
from Chung Bi Mountain.

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:01.861 align:middle line:90%
It's cultivated naturally,

00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:04.563 align:middle line:84%
it's organically grown
in the mountains.

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:08.167 align:middle line:84%
This is about 8-years-old but
it doesn't have those rings.

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:09.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I see.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:10.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Even
though they don't do anything,

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:11.637 align:middle line:90%
the farmers just sit there.

00:26:11.637 --> 00:26:14.006 align:middle line:84%
They just make sure bears and
deer don't come into the farm.

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:17.209 align:middle line:84%
But even that just
because they're sort of --

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:19.545 align:middle line:84%
they put them under sort of
little tents because they need

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:21.047 align:middle line:90%
to have that hiding feeling.

00:26:21.047 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.515 align:middle line:90%
Oh I see.

00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:23.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
But this is --

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:26.285 align:middle line:84%
the rings are much less distinct
and the head doesn't grow long

00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:28.521 align:middle line:84%
like that but if you actually
took the seeds form this

00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and threw that in the
forest it would revert back

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:35.027 align:middle line:84%
to this look the next
generation down the road.

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:36.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And I saw the
beautiful pictures of some

00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:90%
of those roots were --

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that looked exactly like
a male or a female's body.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah,
well that's what they --

00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:45.204 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're called "man
root" and a lot of them look

00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:47.873 align:middle line:84%
like -- I mean you,
you can get obsessed.

00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:50.376 align:middle line:84%
I could have brought one for you
-- from it that you look at it

00:26:50.376 --> 00:26:53.079 align:middle line:84%
and go that's like -- I've
had it for about 30 years.

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:55.014 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
my pet Ginseng root.

00:26:55.014 --> 00:26:58.884 align:middle line:84%
It's got the nose and two
eyes and a little mouth,

00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:00.686 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] and, you know,
got a hat on and, you know --

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:02.288 align:middle line:90%
never mind it's a [laughter] --

00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:03.456 align:middle line:84%
you know, you collect
those things and...

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:04.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That's great.

00:27:04.657 --> 00:27:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...they
come in different shapes

00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:06.726 align:middle line:84%
and people do buy them
because they look like people.

00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
But the main thing is the --

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.096 align:middle line:84%
really the amazingness
of the good chemistry.

00:27:10.096 --> 00:27:12.832 align:middle line:84%
Now I -- what I wanted
to point out to people is

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:14.867 align:middle line:90%
that when you get cheap Ginseng,

00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:16.335 align:middle line:84%
the kind that you
might get at a...

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:17.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Supermarket
or something.

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:18.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah
something like that.

00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:20.906 align:middle line:84%
That Ginseng is only
four-years-old typically

00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:22.608 align:middle line:84%
and the chemistry
hasn't fully developed.

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:24.009 align:middle line:90%
A matter of fact it's developed

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:28.147 align:middle line:84%
in a lopsided way that's more
stimulating and you do get kind

00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:29.682 align:middle line:84%
of -- but it makes
you stressed out.

00:27:29.682 --> 00:27:32.618 align:middle line:84%
So it has -- that --
there's a bad rap on Ginseng

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:35.821 align:middle line:84%
for raising blood pressure
and making people hyper.

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.356 align:middle line:90%
That's from that cheap Ginseng.

00:27:37.356 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:84%
Once Ginseng is eight
years old, then all of --

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:43.229 align:middle line:84%
both sides of the chemistry,
the sympathetic side

00:27:43.229 --> 00:27:46.632 align:middle line:84%
and the para-sympathetic
chemicals, have fully developed

00:27:46.632 --> 00:27:49.535 align:middle line:84%
and from then on it's a very
exquisitely balanced thing.

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:51.771 align:middle line:84%
So for example I never
sell anything less

00:27:51.771 --> 00:27:52.872 align:middle line:90%
than eight-years-old.

00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:55.241 align:middle line:84%
That would be my --
against my principles.

00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:55.941 align:middle line:90%
So, you know.

00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:57.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So that --

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:00.513 align:middle line:84%
it is calming for the nervous
system as well as focusing.

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:01.981 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah Ginseng
is actually -- you take it --

00:28:03.182 --> 00:28:05.451 align:middle line:84%
if you take wild Ginseng
root you become very calm.

00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:07.086 align:middle line:84%
Like some people
think oh I'm going

00:28:07.086 --> 00:28:09.388 align:middle line:84%
to take this wild Ginseng root
and I'm going to get all hyper

00:28:09.388 --> 00:28:11.357 align:middle line:84%
and they fall asleep
for two days [laughter]

00:28:11.357 --> 00:28:13.259 align:middle line:84%
because their body
says you need rest.

00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:16.061 align:middle line:84%
But when they wake up they feel
like they're alive, you know.

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:20.132 align:middle line:84%
They feel the -- that
rush of just life force

00:28:20.132 --> 00:28:22.468 align:middle line:84%
that took a couple
days to build up.

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's another
of those adaptogenic features.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:25.971 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:27.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yes, that's right.

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:28.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now this next
picture is you standing

00:28:28.274 --> 00:28:30.976 align:middle line:84%
at the base of this
mountain and it's --

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:33.979 align:middle line:84%
is it best to harvest
the Ginseng in the winter

00:28:33.979 --> 00:28:35.548 align:middle line:84%
or is there a season
for harvesting?

00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:39.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well actually
you harvest Ginseng in the fall,

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:42.822 align:middle line:84%
or late summer and fall and this
picture was actually not winter

00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:44.323 align:middle line:84%
it's just taken at
Chun Bi Mountain.

00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But Chun Bi Mountain, Chun Bi
means "ever white" mountain

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.197 align:middle line:84%
and so it tends to
stay a snowline,

00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:52.565 align:middle line:84%
snowy at the top
of the mountain.

00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:55.701 align:middle line:84%
So this was actually just
mid-September but it snowed

00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:57.036 align:middle line:90%
that day pretty heavily.

00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was
-- when we went back

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.005 align:middle line:84%
down into China it
was like a heat wave.

00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:01.774 align:middle line:90%
You know, 90 degrees.

00:29:01.774 --> 00:29:04.376 align:middle line:84%
So yeah especially, -- you
can't really find Ginseng

00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:06.178 align:middle line:84%
in the winter because
the top dies off

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:07.413 align:middle line:90%
and it's all hidden in the snow.

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:08.781 align:middle line:90%
This is Manchuria.

00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:11.417 align:middle line:84%
But this is one of the most
beautiful, amazing -- it's a --

00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.219 align:middle line:90%
it's, you know, a special place.

00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:15.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Its waterfalls
and beautiful things there.

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:16.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's got
one of the biggest waterfalls

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:84%
in the world and it's an active
volcano so the, the water --

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
it, it comes from the
center of the earth

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.865 align:middle line:90%
and it's filled with minerals.

00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:30.002 align:middle line:84%
The water's too mineral to drink
but it flows down in huge rivers

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:32.137 align:middle line:84%
down into the mountain
and saturates the earth

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:35.908 align:middle line:84%
and that's why Chun Bi Mountain
grows herbs no place else

00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:37.042 align:middle line:90%
in the world grows.

00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:40.112 align:middle line:84%
That's why Reishi and
Ginseng come from there.

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
[inaudible].

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Unfortunately
I think right now it's showing

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:45.451 align:middle line:90%
signs of about to erupt

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:48.387 align:middle line:84%
which could put a
damper on Ginseng for...

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:49.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: A little while.

00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:49.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...few years.

00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:50.689 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: [Laughter] Yeah.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: But it's,

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.259 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely showing
some signs.

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:55.561 align:middle line:90%
The geologists are going --

00:29:55.561 --> 00:29:58.631 align:middle line:84%
it's active, it's alive so once
every 100 years or so it...

00:29:58.631 --> 00:29:59.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It does.

00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:01.433 align:middle line:84%
It needs to release
that pressure.

00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:02.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:03.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So
tell us a little bit

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:05.971 align:middle line:84%
about the principles
behind Chinese medicine

00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:09.174 align:middle line:84%
and why these particular
herbs are so powerful for us.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:13.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
these herbs have been studied

00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:17.316 align:middle line:84%
since before humans
became civilized

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:19.485 align:middle line:84%
and before their was
actually writing.

00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:24.423 align:middle line:84%
So about 3,000 years ago there
-- the body of knowledge started

00:30:24.423 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:84%
to become consolidated about
herbs which is quite miraculous.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:31.497 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you think of
probably it took 100,000 years

00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:35.768 align:middle line:84%
of pre-humans and human
eating little pieces

00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:37.102 align:middle line:90%
of bark, eating berries.

00:30:37.102 --> 00:30:38.938 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would die,
sometimes they would get sick.

00:30:38.938 --> 00:30:40.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:41.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: They learned
how to smell them and basically

00:30:41.774 --> 00:30:46.011 align:middle line:84%
over so many thousands and
thousands of years a body

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:90%
of oral tradition developed

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.285 align:middle line:84%
and about 2,500 years ago a
great wise man named Shennong

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.321 align:middle line:84%
wrote the first herbal
pharmacopeia in the history

00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:57.056 align:middle line:84%
of the world and it
was quite complete

00:30:57.056 --> 00:31:00.192 align:middle line:90%
and he described 360 herbs.

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.227 align:middle line:84%
He divided them into
three categories.

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:06.765 align:middle line:84%
The main category, the top
was called superior herbs.

00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:08.167 align:middle line:90%
That the tonic herbs.

00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And these are herbs you would
take to promote your wellbeing.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.306 align:middle line:84%
You would take them to
live long, to feel light,

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:17.309 align:middle line:84%
to not get sick,
to, to become --

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.445 align:middle line:84%
to aid in your path
to enlightenment.

00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:22.815 align:middle line:84%
They weren't, they weren't magic
mushrooms but they were things

00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:24.616 align:middle line:90%
that gave you the power.

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.652 align:middle line:84%
So these were called
the superior herbs.

00:31:26.652 --> 00:31:29.722 align:middle line:84%
He also described a set of
herbs called the general herbs

00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:32.992 align:middle line:84%
which were preventative, or
nipped things in the bud.

00:31:32.992 --> 00:31:34.727 align:middle line:84%
Like you would take
them for allergies,

00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:36.528 align:middle line:90%
or for menopausal symptoms.

00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.796 align:middle line:84%
For -- if you're
dealing with problems

00:31:37.796 --> 00:31:39.064 align:middle line:84%
when you're getting
them on and off.

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:39.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Symptoms.

00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:40.933 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:31:40.933 --> 00:31:42.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And they're
safer than medicinal things

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:43.569 align:middle line:90%
but they're not quite tonic.

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:45.104 align:middle line:84%
But so you don't take
them all the time.

00:31:45.104 --> 00:31:46.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:31:46.372 --> 00:31:47.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: The
tonics you can take every day

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:48.207 align:middle line:90%
of your life to live long.

00:31:48.207 --> 00:31:49.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And you
should [laughter].

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:49.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yeah and you should.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And the third
category he divided the herbs

00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:55.147 align:middle line:84%
into was the -- what he
called the inferior herbs

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:56.415 align:middle line:90%
and these are medicines.

00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:59.918 align:middle line:84%
These are herbs that treated
conditions like measles

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.121 align:middle line:90%
or headaches, you know...

00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:02.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Gout.

00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:03.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Everything.

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Everything medicinal.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.593 align:middle line:84%
And but he called him
the inferior herbs

00:32:07.593 --> 00:32:08.627 align:middle line:84%
because it meant
you were waiting

00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:10.696 align:middle line:84%
until after you were
sick to take them.

00:32:10.696 --> 00:32:13.732 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually
primal to our concept

00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:17.503 align:middle line:84%
and to Chinese concept
of, of, of promoting,

00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:18.704 align:middle line:90%
promoting radiant health.

00:32:18.704 --> 00:32:22.808 align:middle line:84%
Like becoming healthy is
your, is your first job

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:25.844 align:middle line:84%
and then maintaining your health
so you can cultivate your life

00:32:25.844 --> 00:32:29.415 align:middle line:84%
and do great things, that's --
you needed tonic herbs as part

00:32:29.415 --> 00:32:32.751 align:middle line:84%
of your support system just
like we need yoga and meditation

00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:34.787 align:middle line:90%
and a good healthy lifestyle.

00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:35.487 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:36.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Balance.

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:37.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: A good diet.

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:39.224 align:middle line:84%
You can't become a
great enlightened person

00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:43.695 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating junk and you're
-- and you abuse your body.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: But can you,

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.698 align:middle line:84%
but can you if you're
eating healthy foods,

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:50.402 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating the raw green
lifestyle or healthy foods?

00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:51.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
you can but do you notice

00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:53.272 align:middle line:90%
that everybody that's who's --

00:32:53.272 --> 00:32:55.207 align:middle line:84%
there's a vast number
of those people

00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:57.309 align:middle line:84%
who are now getting more
advance and are going,

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.213 align:middle line:84%
well tonic herbs are actually
another kick above, you know,

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:05.184 align:middle line:84%
above and beyond included in
the system of a healthy diet.

00:33:05.184 --> 00:33:06.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I see.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Really
the tonic herbs are,

00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:09.054 align:middle line:90%
are another food group.

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:11.657 align:middle line:84%
They're healthy -- they're as
healthy as carrots and peas

00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:14.893 align:middle line:84%
and lettuce, maybe healthier
than those things, and --

00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.162 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being --
not having side effects.

00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:19.331 align:middle line:84%
Yet they're just very rare
and you see they're made

00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:20.866 align:middle line:84%
out of things that
are very tough.

00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:23.268 align:middle line:84%
Like you can't eat
a Reishi mushroom.

00:33:23.268 --> 00:33:24.403 align:middle line:90%
It's too woody.

00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:26.438 align:middle line:84%
You have to, you have
to cook it into a tea

00:33:26.438 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:90%
or abstract it in some way.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:30.476 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with this
piece of cinnamon or...

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:31.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
a piece of cinnamon?

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:34.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah
that's a piece of cinnamon.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That is beautiful.

00:33:35.147 --> 00:33:35.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
That's real cinnamon.

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:37.349 align:middle line:90%
What we get in the market now is

00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:38.851 align:middle line:84%
for when people put
in their [inaudible].

00:33:38.851 --> 00:33:40.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah
little sticks.

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:41.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
It's not the real deal.

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.488 align:middle line:84%
Okay? This is actually
a real cinnamon.

00:33:42.488 --> 00:33:44.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I have
not seen one this big.

00:33:44.123 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.358 align:middle line:84%
This is actually how cinnamon
really looks [laughter]

00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:47.359 align:middle line:90%
in the real world.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:90%
Very strong.

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.528 align:middle line:90%
That's a tonic herb.

00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:52.798 align:middle line:84%
Builds your -- the fire of
life and goes to your abdomen,

00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:56.268 align:middle line:84%
makes you live longer
and live more powerfully.

00:33:56.268 --> 00:33:59.304 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the tonic herbs
are something you can't get

00:33:59.304 --> 00:34:00.639 align:middle line:90%
from your food.

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:03.075 align:middle line:84%
You -- I mean you -- I -- you
have to have a great diet.

00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:07.479 align:middle line:84%
You have to focus on eating
for vibrancy and freshness

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:10.582 align:middle line:84%
and all the different
colors and we have to --

00:34:10.582 --> 00:34:13.051 align:middle line:84%
but tonic herbs are
like a food group

00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.385 align:middle line:90%
that you just aren't getting.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:17.823 align:middle line:84%
You can't get the chemistry
of a Reishi mushroom from...

00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:18.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: From food.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:19.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
...from your garden.

00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:20.057 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:20.825 align:middle line:90%
Or of a Ginseng root.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:21.927 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: All those --

00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:84%
that diet is a great
base for [inaudible].

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:24.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You
have to have a great diet.

00:34:24.897 --> 00:34:26.564 align:middle line:84%
You know if you take
your tonic herbs

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:31.103 align:middle line:84%
and you eat only junky food then
you're still going to die young

00:34:31.103 --> 00:34:33.171 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to
get very intelligent.

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:35.007 align:middle line:84%
The fat's going to
go to your brain.

00:34:35.007 --> 00:34:36.041 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:37.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
toxins [inaudible].

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yeah, but if you --

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:41.046 align:middle line:84%
this is part of a
healthy program.

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:45.651 align:middle line:84%
It's like its -- if its
tonic herbs you do it daily.

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I -- it's critical, American's
start to grow up herbally.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's -- this is my
lifespans mission is

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.495 align:middle line:84%
that in Asian they have
this ancient concept

00:34:56.495 --> 00:34:59.231 align:middle line:84%
of superior herbalism
and inferior herbalism

00:34:59.231 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
or inferior diet and
superior diet too.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.102 align:middle line:84%
Where you can take
certain things

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.772 align:middle line:90%
that promote your life force

00:35:06.772 --> 00:35:09.308 align:middle line:84%
so you develop certain
energy centers,

00:35:09.308 --> 00:35:10.909 align:middle line:90%
the nerve in your spine.

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:12.144 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's doing yoga.

00:35:12.144 --> 00:35:13.946 align:middle line:84%
You know? It's not
just a stretch.

00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:16.481 align:middle line:84%
It's to open up the
energy centers and,

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.017 align:middle line:84%
and expand your consciousness
and become at peace,

00:35:19.017 --> 00:35:22.487 align:middle line:84%
but also powerful and
the tonic herbs are

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:90%
that from Mother Earth.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.758 align:middle line:84%
That's where they --
that's what they are.

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So now in the --

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.963 align:middle line:84%
in the Chinese medicine system
I heard about the five elements

00:35:30.963 --> 00:35:33.498 align:middle line:84%
or elemental system
of Chinese medicine.

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:37.035 align:middle line:84%
How do the herbs support that
system of Chinese medicine?

00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:39.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
fundamentally before

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:41.006 align:middle line:90%
that there's Yin and Yong.

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:42.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:35:42.074 --> 00:35:43.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
There is Yin and Yong.

00:35:43.275 --> 00:35:45.677 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe
has got hot and cold,

00:35:45.677 --> 00:35:47.179 align:middle line:90%
up and down, you and me.

00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:48.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Balance.

00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:51.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You know,
it's about balance and that --

00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:54.286 align:middle line:84%
Yin and Yong is like, is
a cycle, is a description

00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:57.222 align:middle line:84%
of cyclable, the cyclable
nature of the universe.

00:35:57.222 --> 00:36:00.792 align:middle line:84%
Everything in nature
grows and shrinks.

00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And like for example --
and, and sometimes right

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.931 align:middle line:90%
at this moment I'm being --

00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:07.599 align:middle line:84%
you and I are in a
Yin Yong relationship

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:10.302 align:middle line:84%
where I'm being Yong because
I'm talking and you're receiving

00:36:10.302 --> 00:36:13.505 align:middle line:84%
in -- but as you store that
and then you come back to me

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.207 align:middle line:84%
and then you become
Yong and I become Yin.

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:16.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I see.

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And
that relationship is --

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.677 align:middle line:90%
we see it every place in nature.

00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:22.414 align:middle line:84%
And the -- that, so
once you understand Yin

00:36:22.414 --> 00:36:24.816 align:middle line:84%
and Yong you can sort of
get balance into your life.

00:36:24.816 --> 00:36:26.218 align:middle line:90%
It's -- it takes a while.

00:36:26.218 --> 00:36:28.387 align:middle line:90%
At first it seems arcane

00:36:28.387 --> 00:36:30.555 align:middle line:84%
but after a while it just
becomes this is what life is.

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:33.992 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that isn't
about cycles and rhythm.

00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:37.296 align:middle line:84%
Nothing. Your heartbeats, then
it relaxes, then it beats.

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:90%
You breathe in...

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting, yeah.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:39.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...relax.

00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:41.133 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
-- you get high

00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:43.268 align:middle line:90%
on a person then you pull back.

00:36:43.268 --> 00:36:45.003 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, and if it's
a relationship you have

00:36:45.003 --> 00:36:46.738 align:middle line:90%
to keep that pulse going.

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:47.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That balance.

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:48.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:48.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:36:48.974 --> 00:36:50.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Okay

00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:52.678 align:middle line:84%
so the five elements is
really just a refinement.

00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:55.681 align:middle line:84%
It's a refinement
of Yin and Yong.

00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:59.017 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
four elements --

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:03.989 align:middle line:84%
and the general factor like
one of where Yin starts

00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:05.424 align:middle line:90%
and then Yin becomes full.

00:37:05.424 --> 00:37:06.858 align:middle line:90%
If Yin starts in winter --

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:09.728 align:middle line:84%
or in the fall that's when
the energy's coming in

00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:13.532 align:middle line:84%
and then it develops fully into
winter and then spring starts

00:37:13.532 --> 00:37:17.569 align:middle line:84%
and Yong starts to rise and then
it becomes full in summer time

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:19.604 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes to
fall and that's a cycle.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:23.976 align:middle line:84%
So that's four of the
elements that -- for the --

00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that's fire, metal,
water, and wood elements.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:30.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: We
have a chart here.

00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:32.117 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, we have a chart here
that you could just -- yeah.

00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:32.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Okay.

00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:33.919 align:middle line:90%
And then -- but then the concept

00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:35.487 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth element
is called earth

00:37:35.487 --> 00:37:38.323 align:middle line:84%
and that represents the balance
of them all, the centeredness,

00:37:38.323 --> 00:37:41.994 align:middle line:84%
the anchor that keeps them
all unified into one thing.

00:37:41.994 --> 00:37:44.996 align:middle line:84%
So basically that was a concept
and then they're associated

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.799 align:middle line:84%
with the organs and the
seasons as I just mentioned.

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:49.668 align:middle line:84%
The elements are
associated with seasons

00:37:49.668 --> 00:37:51.536 align:middle line:90%
but also with food and herbs.

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:56.575 align:middle line:84%
So some herbs nurture your wood
elements and nurture your fire.

00:37:56.575 --> 00:38:00.045 align:middle line:84%
Like the cinnamon I mentioned
it's hot, it's cinnamon.

00:38:00.045 --> 00:38:02.447 align:middle line:90%
This is much, much hotter

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:05.384 align:middle line:84%
than the cheap cinnamon we
usually get for mulled cider.

00:38:05.384 --> 00:38:06.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh I see.

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:07.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Okay?

00:38:07.386 --> 00:38:09.154 align:middle line:84%
So when you consume a little
of this cooked into a tea

00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:14.059 align:middle line:84%
or as a powder in a, in a
concoction it's going to go in

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:16.928 align:middle line:84%
and promote the fire
element in a good way.

00:38:16.928 --> 00:38:18.397 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going
to go to your belly

00:38:18.397 --> 00:38:20.565 align:middle line:90%
and stimulate your life force...

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Metabolism.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yeah, metabolism

00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and your sexual energy
and your creativity.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.538 align:middle line:84%
All the things that are
associated with more

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:29.508 align:middle line:90%
of a power, expansive power.

00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:31.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
so interesting.

00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:84%
The shaker jar of
cinnamon you get

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:34.246 align:middle line:84%
at the market is [laughter]
doesn't do as much.

00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:36.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well it's
going to have a little bit

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:38.183 align:middle line:84%
but it's, you know, they're
commercially growing it

00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:38.984 align:middle line:90%
for flavor.

00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:40.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:41.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's not
the most powerful cinnamon

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.488 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but
it's still cinnamon.

00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So these types of
herbs and how they're related

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:49.728 align:middle line:84%
to the Yin and Yong of the
body and the Yin and Yong

00:38:49.728 --> 00:38:53.532 align:middle line:84%
of the seasons is the concept
behind Chinese medicine,

00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:54.232 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:55.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:58.336 align:middle line:84%
Except that with the tonic
herbs beautifully most

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:01.206 align:middle line:84%
of them are what they
call double direction

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:02.707 align:middle line:90%
and they tend to stimulate both.

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:05.177 align:middle line:84%
That -- the tonic herbs you
can take on a daily basis

00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:07.179 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
so cold, not so hot.

00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:09.081 align:middle line:90%
They just tend to help regulate.

00:39:09.081 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Many of the medicinal herbs
are very cold or very hot.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.151 align:middle line:90%
So you take them for --

00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.154 align:middle line:84%
if you have a fever you take a
very cold herb -- or, you know.

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:17.789 align:middle line:84%
If you got the chills
and you're --

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:19.991 align:middle line:84%
you have not circulation
you would take a hot herb

00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:21.293 align:middle line:84%
and it depends on
your condition.

00:39:21.293 --> 00:39:25.931 align:middle line:84%
With the tonics when you get
a good blend it's actually

00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:29.201 align:middle line:84%
nourishing the whole cycle
of the five elements, the Yin

00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:33.505 align:middle line:84%
and Yong and, and keeps it going
in a -- really it becomes a --

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:36.208 align:middle line:84%
you could almost be ignorant of
how it works and still take them

00:39:36.208 --> 00:39:37.809 align:middle line:84%
and they're still doing
right for your body.

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:40.378 align:middle line:84%
Rather the medicinal
herbs I would never...

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: [Inaudible] more.

00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:42.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You can't --

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:43.381 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to a Chinese
doctor to tell you what

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:44.883 align:middle line:90%
to take because it's risky.

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:46.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So in the season

00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:48.553 align:middle line:84%
that stay more Yong it's
better to take more...

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:49.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
You take Yin herbs.

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:49.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: ...Yin herbs.

00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:50.555 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:51.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Right.

00:39:51.223 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:90%
And during -- right.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:56.027 align:middle line:84%
So I got an example is an
herb like this, is Gynostemma.

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We can talk more about it later
but this was from my garden.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.934 align:middle line:84%
I plucked it this morning
just to kind of show it.

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.369 align:middle line:90%
Gynostemma is like Ginseng

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:07.606 align:middle line:84%
because it contains the
same chemistry as Ginseng,

00:40:07.606 --> 00:40:09.641 align:middle line:90%
maybe even in some ways better.

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:12.277 align:middle line:90%
This contains genocides just

00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:15.547 align:middle line:84%
like Ginseng except
it's a cooler --

00:40:15.547 --> 00:40:20.685 align:middle line:84%
it's cool so it helps
your body to stay cooler.

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:22.787 align:middle line:84%
Now that's critical in
the big picture of things

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:26.024 align:middle line:84%
because as we get older
the body naturally tends

00:40:26.024 --> 00:40:27.425 align:middle line:90%
to become inflamed.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:32.063 align:middle line:84%
Not, not like arthritis, those
kind of inflammatory diseases

00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:34.533 align:middle line:84%
but just generally what
you call inflammaging.

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:36.201 align:middle line:90%
Aging due to inflammation.

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:38.904 align:middle line:84%
Like this is just what happens
to us until when we're very old,

00:40:38.904 --> 00:40:42.707 align:middle line:84%
we're very inflamed and then
we pass away because we're so.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:45.944 align:middle line:90%
So this is, this herb is --

00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:48.013 align:middle line:84%
comes from the region that
has the oldest living people

00:40:48.013 --> 00:40:49.314 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:40:49.314 --> 00:40:51.349 align:middle line:84%
It has more octogenarians
and centenarians per capita

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:54.119 align:middle line:84%
than any place in the world
and this is their daily tea.

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.522 align:middle line:84%
It's consumed as a
tea and you drink it

00:40:57.522 --> 00:41:00.559 align:middle line:84%
and it prevents this
inflammaging from occurring

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:90%
because it's cooling, cooling.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting.

00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:04.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You
see on a long-term basis.

00:41:04.296 --> 00:41:05.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I see yeah so...

00:41:05.664 --> 00:41:06.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You can also
drink it in the summer just

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:07.666 align:middle line:90%
to cool down like mint.

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:10.769 align:middle line:84%
But it's -- there's stronger
things for the immediate.

00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:13.738 align:middle line:84%
This is a long-term,
longevity cool.

00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:14.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Base.

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:15.507 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:41:15.507 --> 00:41:17.208 align:middle line:84%
And as, as we've learned
you can take a tea like that

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.977 align:middle line:90%
and then add the Chaga mushroom,

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:22.647 align:middle line:84%
or you can add the Reishi
mushroom powders into it.

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:24.616 align:middle line:90%
So now how do you boil these

00:41:24.616 --> 00:41:28.453 align:middle line:84%
down into a tincture
form or into a tea?

00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:30.889 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a process
that you use in order

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:33.425 align:middle line:84%
to get the powder
from the Reishi.

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.562 align:middle line:84%
in traditional times obviously
people would find this

00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:38.597 align:middle line:90%
and then they would take it home

00:41:38.597 --> 00:41:40.632 align:middle line:84%
and they would put
it in a big pot.

00:41:40.632 --> 00:41:42.801 align:middle line:84%
You know, a clay pot or
an iron pot or something

00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.604 align:middle line:84%
and they would cook it for two
or three hours and drink it.

00:41:45.604 --> 00:41:46.938 align:middle line:90%
But it would spoil.

00:41:46.938 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a refrigerator
and they would have to --

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.643 align:middle line:84%
so maybe they would soak it
in alcohol or, you know --

00:41:51.643 --> 00:41:53.478 align:middle line:90%
so it would last longer.

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:55.814 align:middle line:84%
Thinner Reishi mushroom in
the forest or you were able

00:41:55.814 --> 00:41:57.482 align:middle line:90%
to buy a [inaudible] or Ginseng.

00:41:57.482 --> 00:42:00.018 align:middle line:84%
You know, those kind of things
you would try to preserve it

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:03.822 align:middle line:84%
in some way but basically we've
evolved into an amazing era

00:42:03.822 --> 00:42:06.992 align:middle line:84%
as we know from everything
else in this world now is

00:42:06.992 --> 00:42:10.495 align:middle line:84%
like the technology has
made it possible to --

00:42:10.495 --> 00:42:13.698 align:middle line:84%
which was only invented in the
1960's to extract these things.

00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:16.301 align:middle line:84%
It's within our lifetime and
at least my lifetime that...

00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:17.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh my goodness.

00:42:17.669 --> 00:42:19.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...they've
learned how to extract herbs

00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:21.206 align:middle line:90%
in the way they do now.

00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:22.907 align:middle line:90%
You, you can take these herbs.

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.542 align:middle line:90%
You can create the combination.

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:27.679 align:middle line:84%
You put the herbs into
a tank that maybe is --

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:30.849 align:middle line:84%
hold a half a ton of herbs,
or a ton, or three tons.

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:34.319 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the size of your --
and then it cooks it for --

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:37.022 align:middle line:84%
at a certain temperature
depending on the technology.

00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:39.324 align:middle line:84%
The better the technology
the lower the temperature

00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:42.494 align:middle line:84%
but it cooks it under
pressure and then at the end

00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:44.896 align:middle line:84%
of that time you have
a soup and then they,

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.731 align:middle line:84%
they can what they
call spray dry it.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.768 align:middle line:84%
They put it into another
tank that sprays up and it --

00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:52.137 align:middle line:84%
and the water evaporates
and the powder comes out.

00:42:52.137 --> 00:42:53.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh my goodness.

00:42:53.505 --> 00:42:55.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: That's what
we get and the simple things

00:42:55.073 --> 00:43:01.179 align:middle line:84%
that you can do for example I
make about 300 herbal products

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:05.517 align:middle line:84%
and all of them are what they
call pure yield which means,

00:43:05.517 --> 00:43:07.519 align:middle line:84%
we just -- they come
out exactly the herb.

00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:10.488 align:middle line:90%
We don't mix in starch.

00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:12.123 align:middle line:90%
You know like 50% starch is kind

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:14.759 align:middle line:84%
of standard but we
don't do that.

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:15.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting.

00:43:15.894 --> 00:43:16.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Or
cellulose or something.

00:43:16.561 --> 00:43:17.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:18.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: But basically

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:19.364 align:middle line:84%
when you're spray drying
it the powder can come out

00:43:19.364 --> 00:43:21.833 align:middle line:90%
and then you can just --

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:23.635 align:middle line:84%
you [inaudible] sterile
situation you can put it

00:43:23.635 --> 00:43:25.770 align:middle line:84%
into drums and eventually
we put it into capsules.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.607 align:middle line:84%
And, and it's actually better
than actually cooking your own.

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:34.446 align:middle line:84%
I know it's super fun to take,
you know, something like this

00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:36.948 align:middle line:84%
and put it in a pot and
cook it but you know you can

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.483 align:middle line:84%
over cook it, you
can undercook it,

00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:40.151 align:middle line:90%
you can forget to turn it off.

00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's all kinds
of things that could happen.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.555 align:middle line:90%
But this all under control.

00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:46.791 align:middle line:84%
We know how to extract it,
and it's just pure powder but,

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.426 align:middle line:84%
you know, and you can get
the best herbs in the world

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:49.227 align:middle line:90%
or you can get cheap herbs.

00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:50.895 align:middle line:90%
It depends on what you do.

00:43:50.895 --> 00:43:53.798 align:middle line:84%
But what you could --
obviously you can't make gold

00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:54.933 align:middle line:90%
out of straw.

00:43:54.933 --> 00:43:57.102 align:middle line:84%
So what goes into the
pot that's what I do.

00:43:57.102 --> 00:43:58.436 align:middle line:90%
I pick the herbs.

00:43:58.436 --> 00:43:59.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, so it's
very scientifically measured

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.039 align:middle line:90%
and based.

00:44:01.039 --> 00:44:02.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Right
and that technology has come

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:04.209 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it's
rocket science at this point.

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:06.945 align:middle line:90%
It's all computerized and done

00:44:06.945 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
under the most amazing
conditions.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Extreme
circumstances.

00:44:10.749 --> 00:44:11.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:12.851 align:middle line:84%
When I first got into
the business just

00:44:12.851 --> 00:44:15.720 align:middle line:84%
to show once again
how old I am I guess

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.222 align:middle line:84%
because [inaudible]
[laughter] they used to,

00:44:17.222 --> 00:44:18.523 align:middle line:90%
they actually used to...

00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:19.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Sit it yeah.

00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:20.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Stir it.

00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:21.092 align:middle line:90%
Make parts of it by stirring.

00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:22.627 align:middle line:84%
I actually got to
do that myself.

00:44:22.627 --> 00:44:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: We'll
get a chance to see

00:44:23.495 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:90%
that a little bit later but...

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:25.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah but
nowadays I couldn't do that.

00:44:25.964 --> 00:44:27.165 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even
let me in the room.

00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:28.466 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
you have to put the --

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.436 align:middle line:84%
you have to put a
hazmat outfit on to go

00:44:31.436 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:90%
into these rooms [laughter].

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.739 align:middle line:90%
They're -- it's so advanced and

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:38.576 align:middle line:84%
but the more advanced it is
the more natural the produce is

00:44:38.576 --> 00:44:39.411 align:middle line:90%
actually coming.

00:44:39.411 --> 00:44:40.578 align:middle line:90%
It used to be when you cook it

00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:42.647 align:middle line:84%
under a stove you're
actually boiling off half

00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:43.882 align:middle line:90%
of the essential oils.

00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:45.316 align:middle line:84%
Now it's done under
these conditions

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:46.818 align:middle line:90%
where it's all natural.

00:44:46.818 --> 00:44:48.353 align:middle line:90%
The solvents are natural.

00:44:48.353 --> 00:44:51.122 align:middle line:84%
There's -- you capture
all of the essential oils

00:44:51.122 --> 00:44:53.158 align:middle line:84%
and do what they call oil
traps in the crystalizing

00:44:53.158 --> 00:44:54.492 align:middle line:90%
and you can put it back in.

00:44:54.492 --> 00:44:55.527 align:middle line:90%
So you're losing nothing.

00:44:55.527 --> 00:44:57.061 align:middle line:90%
Matter of fact you're gaining.

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.365 align:middle line:84%
It's got to the point of -- and
I know about herbs and if I --

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:03.134 align:middle line:84%
if somebody said, "Would you
rather take these extracts

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:04.269 align:middle line:90%
or the real thing?

00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:05.403 align:middle line:84%
If you had one choice
for your whole life."

00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:07.438 align:middle line:84%
I would probably go
with the extracts now

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:90%
because they're just overall...

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting
broken down [inaudible].

00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So back to
the Chinese medicine system.

00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:16.681 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about how
these different types

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:20.084 align:middle line:84%
of herbs create balance in the
body and create balance in --

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:84%
according to the
different times of year.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.557 align:middle line:84%
So is there something specific
that you could take say

00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:27.625 align:middle line:84%
to warm yourself
up in the winter?

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned cooling.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah,

00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:32.597 align:middle line:84%
people take the Chinese
Ginseng during the wintertime.

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:36.167 align:middle line:84%
You can also take all these
Reishi which is neutral.

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.569 align:middle line:90%
Most of the tonic --

00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:40.104 align:middle line:84%
the Cistanche over there
is what they call warm.

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:41.506 align:middle line:90%
It's got a -- this -- just

00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:43.575 align:middle line:84%
like there's five elements
there's five levels.

00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:46.711 align:middle line:84%
There's hot and warm,
neutral, cool, and cold.

00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:49.113 align:middle line:90%
So you can think like that.

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:53.618 align:middle line:84%
I live in California so I just
go for some warm, some cool,

00:45:53.618 --> 00:45:56.888 align:middle line:84%
a lot in the middle and
its major tonic herbs.

00:45:56.888 --> 00:45:59.791 align:middle line:84%
But some people will find
that in the wintertime just

00:45:59.791 --> 00:46:01.793 align:middle line:84%
like you would eat winter
squashes in the winter

00:46:01.793 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and you'd eat summer squashes in
the summer they cool you down.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.232 align:middle line:84%
So that takes a little
bit more knowledge.

00:46:07.232 --> 00:46:13.371 align:middle line:84%
The ideal -- the point is, is
that's actually the easy part.

00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The, the real part is
the three treasures

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.276 align:middle line:84%
which I think is
the next part of...

00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:20.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What I
want to learn about.

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:23.915 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have this
wonderful picture of a drawing

00:46:23.915 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and can you explain
his a little bit?

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.051 align:middle line:90%
This is a...

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:28.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well this is
just an old picture that I have.

00:46:28.253 --> 00:46:32.824 align:middle line:84%
I think I got this from
the Shaolin Temple.

00:46:32.824 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And it, it's just showing
the five elements how

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.661 align:middle line:90%
that works in the body.

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:37.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The body.

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:38.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
It's an old thing.

00:46:38.363 --> 00:46:39.597 align:middle line:90%
They had an old concept

00:46:39.597 --> 00:46:41.199 align:middle line:84%
of the organs being
associated with the elements.

00:46:41.199 --> 00:46:43.935 align:middle line:84%
So you see the four elements
I mentioned representing the

00:46:43.935 --> 00:46:46.571 align:middle line:84%
seasons plus the one in the
middle being earth that,

00:46:46.571 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:90%
that holds it all together.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Earth in Chinese
philosophy means balance.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.078 align:middle line:90%
It's the centering part.

00:46:54.078 --> 00:46:55.280 align:middle line:90%
No matter how far you go

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.781 align:middle line:84%
to one extreme you're
going to get pulled back.

00:46:56.781 --> 00:46:59.984 align:middle line:84%
So and then down at the bottom
there's this little cauldron,

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:04.389 align:middle line:84%
a brass cauldron and that's
called the "golden stove"

00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:07.392 align:middle line:84%
and that -- if you get that
to be strong you're going

00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:08.393 align:middle line:90%
to live long.

00:47:08.393 --> 00:47:10.194 align:middle line:84%
That's Daois- --
that's why the people --

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:13.264 align:middle line:84%
you know the old thing of
meditating into your belly.

00:47:13.264 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And why cinnamon goes to your --

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
real cinnamon, not cheap
cinnamon, but real cinnamon

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.339 align:middle line:84%
if you consume it, it actually
goes and makes that fire

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:23.641 align:middle line:84%
in your belly that makes
the whole five elements.

00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:24.842 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's a
longevity remedy.

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Is that
what the triple warmer is?

00:47:26.444 --> 00:47:28.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
That's the triple,

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:30.248 align:middle line:84%
that's what the triple
warm -- that's another --

00:47:30.248 --> 00:47:33.484 align:middle line:84%
the triple warmer
represents the three levels

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:34.652 align:middle line:90%
of the body and how it works.

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:36.654 align:middle line:90%
It's a little complicated but.

00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:37.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I hear
about it all the time.

00:47:37.689 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah, it's --

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.927 align:middle line:84%
the triple warmer represents you
-- the consumption of energy,

00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:45.663 align:middle line:84%
the assimilation of the energy,
then the elimination of waste.

00:47:45.663 --> 00:47:46.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh I see.

00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:47.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
And the utilization

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:48.666 align:middle line:90%
of energy throughout the body

00:47:48.666 --> 00:47:50.335 align:middle line:84%
and that's just the
steps it goes

00:47:50.335 --> 00:47:52.003 align:middle line:84%
through is the upper
burner, the middle burner

00:47:52.003 --> 00:47:54.439 align:middle line:84%
and the lower burner
and that is kind of how

00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:90%
that chart was -- yeah.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And so now you
mentioned the three treasures,

00:47:57.709 --> 00:47:59.243 align:middle line:90%
the three basic concepts.

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah this
is the most important thing

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:03.781 align:middle line:84%
and like Yin and Yong the
three treasures is fundamental

00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:06.084 align:middle line:90%
to how we live.

00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We -- as a human being we all
have three main types of energy.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.256 align:middle line:84%
The -- they're called
Jing, Qi, and Chen

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.591 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's heard of Chi.

00:48:13.591 --> 00:48:15.893 align:middle line:84%
It's like you know,
everybody's Chi,

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:84%
you know Bruce Lee has
Qi when he does this.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:48:20.131 --> 00:48:21.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You
know, that kind of thing.

00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:23.234 align:middle line:90%
A plant has Qi when it grows.

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:26.371 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of sometimes
encompassing the really all

00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:27.238 align:middle line:90%
three treasures.

00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.774 align:middle line:90%
The first treasure is Jing.

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:31.109 align:middle line:90%
Jing is our life force.

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:33.644 align:middle line:84%
That's what we -- you and I
inherited from our parents.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.747 align:middle line:84%
It's the genetics
of our life force.

00:48:35.747 --> 00:48:38.116 align:middle line:84%
So it determines how
long we're going to live

00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:40.251 align:middle line:90%
and the power of our life.

00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:42.453 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who's got
strong Jing is going to live

00:48:42.453 --> 00:48:44.956 align:middle line:84%
to be a 100-years-old or more
and they're going to have --

00:48:44.956 --> 00:48:47.792 align:middle line:84%
be very powerful and creative
and they'll be productive.

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:50.928 align:middle line:84%
And but if you're -- but we
use up our Jing every day

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.598 align:middle line:84%
of our life just living and if
you're under a lot of stress,

00:48:53.598 --> 00:48:56.768 align:middle line:84%
or we burn ourselves out,
then we burn up Jing rapidly

00:48:56.768 --> 00:48:58.102 align:middle line:90%
and it's like our battery.

00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:02.907 align:middle line:84%
So we need to recharge it
and I, I promise you 99.9%

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:05.176 align:middle line:84%
of Americans don't know
how to recharge their...

00:49:05.176 --> 00:49:05.977 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Recharge.

00:49:05.977 --> 00:49:06.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...Ging.

00:49:06.644 --> 00:49:07.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:09.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And that's
what the tonic herbs do.

00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:13.051 align:middle line:84%
The Yong tonics like the
Cistanche or some kinds

00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:16.421 align:middle line:84%
of Ginseng or the Goji
berries which is the greatest

00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:21.325 align:middle line:84%
of the rechargers; that's
why Goji's are so famous.

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:24.195 align:middle line:84%
You take them they recharge
Jing and that's our life force.

00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:25.496 align:middle line:90%
That your basic power.

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:27.899 align:middle line:84%
And when you're, you're
exhausted it makes you run

00:49:27.899 --> 00:49:29.767 align:middle line:84%
out of Jing and that's
when you get the dark rings

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:32.203 align:middle line:84%
under your eyes and, you
know, chronic fatigue types

00:49:32.203 --> 00:49:34.505 align:middle line:90%
of conditions and so forth.

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:36.207 align:middle line:90%
The second treasure is Chi.

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:38.242 align:middle line:84%
That's what we get
from breathing

00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:40.511 align:middle line:84%
and from eating our
food and digesting.

00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:43.081 align:middle line:84%
And they -- the energy from
the breath and the energy

00:49:43.081 --> 00:49:46.451 align:middle line:84%
from out food combine to give
us the energy that we use --

00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:50.121 align:middle line:84%
I'm using to move my arms
and move my -- and to live.

00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:51.656 align:middle line:90%
And that's day to day.

00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:54.125 align:middle line:84%
Jing was ancient and
it's passing through us.

00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:56.661 align:middle line:84%
And we pass it onto our children
through our reproductive system.

00:49:56.661 --> 00:49:58.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh interesting.

00:49:58.029 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: But Qi is
day-to-day, moment to moment.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.599 align:middle line:84%
So we can't live
without Qi for very long.

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:04.268 align:middle line:84%
We can't -- you can't
stop breathing or you die

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:06.003 align:middle line:90%
and the same way with eating.

00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:09.507 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Then a third -- and
the Qi also controls your

00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:10.908 align:middle line:90%
immune system.

00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It's protection.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:14.378 align:middle line:84%
It give you -- so if you have
a lot of Qi you're protected.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:17.515 align:middle line:84%
And so that's, so you really
need Jing for your power

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.083 align:middle line:90%
and Qi to protect you.

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:19.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:50:19.784 --> 00:50:20.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Okay.

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And the third treasure is Shen.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.921 align:middle line:90%
Shen is your spirit.

00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.724 align:middle line:84%
It's your mind and
your spiritual powers.

00:50:26.724 --> 00:50:28.726 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of -- I, I --

00:50:28.726 --> 00:50:33.498 align:middle line:84%
my personal approach is that
it's the divinity, it's the God

00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:36.267 align:middle line:84%
that lives, resides within
our heart and we express

00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:37.835 align:middle line:84%
but people can see
it anyway that want

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:40.304 align:middle line:84%
but it is the same thing no
matter how you express it or --

00:50:40.304 --> 00:50:41.639 align:middle line:90%
since it is our divinity.

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:45.543 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately there
is an analogy in Daoism

00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:47.912 align:middle line:84%
that used candles as
the perfect analogy

00:50:47.912 --> 00:50:51.082 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're looking at
there where the wax and the wick

00:50:51.082 --> 00:50:53.885 align:middle line:84%
of the candle that's Jing,
that's what you come with.

00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:54.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:55.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
That's what burns down

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.121 align:middle line:90%
and you get a certain amount.

00:50:57.121 --> 00:50:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the flame, the actually
burning of it that's Chi.

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.859 align:middle line:84%
And then the light
given off that's Shen.

00:51:01.859 --> 00:51:02.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, oh wonderful.

00:51:02.693 --> 00:51:04.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And so

00:51:04.095 --> 00:51:06.531 align:middle line:84%
if you have a big candle then
you can have a big flame that's

00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:08.366 align:middle line:90%
also hard to blow out.

00:51:08.366 --> 00:51:10.401 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you have a
birthday candle body, you know,

00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Jing then the
slightest wind will blow

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:13.704 align:middle line:90%
you out.

00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:14.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, interesting.

00:51:14.972 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And
that's where I was when I was

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.041 align:middle line:84%
in college was I
had used up my Jing.

00:51:17.041 --> 00:51:19.544 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
was knocking me off.

00:51:19.544 --> 00:51:22.847 align:middle line:84%
And then when I met Master
Park he goes, "We're just going

00:51:22.847 --> 00:51:23.948 align:middle line:90%
to build -- spend a 100 days

00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:26.217 align:middle line:84%
and build your Jing
and protect you."

00:51:26.217 --> 00:51:27.752 align:middle line:84%
And so for the first
100 days I was

00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:30.021 align:middle line:90%
with him he just built my Jing.

00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:34.625 align:middle line:84%
And then all my symptoms which
I had a whole laundry list of,

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:37.328 align:middle line:84%
things that you would not
think were treatable like that.

00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:40.264 align:middle line:84%
Like joint pains and
headaches and all kinds

00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:41.599 align:middle line:90%
of problems, you know.

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.834 align:middle line:84%
They just -- it all went away
because my Jing came back.

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:44.869 align:middle line:90%
It's like a...

00:51:44.869 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
restored your Jing.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:46.404 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:47.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That's wonderful.

00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:48.105 align:middle line:84%
I love the picture
of the candle.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.440 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.043 align:middle line:84%
Now Chinese medicine teaches
a lot through these types

00:51:52.043 --> 00:51:54.445 align:middle line:84%
of analogies and through
their beautiful artwork.

00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:58.583 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture that you
gave us of the Goddess Magu?

00:51:58.583 --> 00:51:59.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Magu.

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:00.151 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:00.151 --> 00:52:01.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
what does this show?

00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:05.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well this
is an old painting that --

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:06.824 align:middle line:90%
and it's Magu, she's just --

00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:09.393 align:middle line:84%
Magu was the Goddess
of Youth and Beauty.

00:52:09.393 --> 00:52:11.829 align:middle line:90%
She supposedly by legend --

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:15.166 align:middle line:84%
when she was 18 she became
enlightened for some reason.

00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:17.935 align:middle line:90%
She got -- met Daoists who --

00:52:17.935 --> 00:52:20.504 align:middle line:84%
she just was one of those
early bloomers in terms of --

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:22.273 align:middle line:90%
and so she became an immortal.

00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:23.774 align:middle line:90%
She was not -- she never aged.

00:52:23.774 --> 00:52:25.376 align:middle line:90%
She always stayed eternally 18.

00:52:25.376 --> 00:52:26.911 align:middle line:90%
So she's still to this day is

00:52:26.911 --> 00:52:30.581 align:middle line:84%
like on everybody's birthday
cards in China for women.

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:31.716 align:middle line:90%
You know never aging.

00:52:31.716 --> 00:52:34.318 align:middle line:84%
And so but her mission
in life then was

00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:36.988 align:middle line:84%
to turn people onto
the tonic herbs.

00:52:36.988 --> 00:52:39.924 align:middle line:84%
So this is a painting of her
actually with a Reishi mushroom,

00:52:39.924 --> 00:52:45.196 align:middle line:84%
and some Schisandra, and then
a magical longevity peace

00:52:45.196 --> 00:52:46.364 align:middle line:90%
but that's -- the red thing's

00:52:46.364 --> 00:52:48.132 align:middle line:84%
over is Schisandra berries
and the [inaudible].

00:52:48.132 --> 00:52:52.737 align:middle line:84%
And she's giving it to these
you know potential adepts

00:52:52.737 --> 00:52:54.872 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to live to be
an immortal and that's...

00:52:54.872 --> 00:52:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow, wonderful.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Only problem
with this one was she's so,

00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:02.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, cute because she
was 18 and perfect that one

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.849 align:middle line:84%
of the guys, he's losing
control of himself.

00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:06.050 align:middle line:90%
He's blushing, you know.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.952 align:middle line:84%
He's like going uh, which
is kind of ruining --

00:53:07.952 --> 00:53:09.053 align:middle line:84%
that's what the painting
is about.

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:09.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh okay.

00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:11.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: She's trying

00:53:11.155 --> 00:53:12.189 align:middle line:84%
to serve him the Reishi
mushrooms and he's going wow.

00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: He's
blushing [laughter].

00:53:13.324 --> 00:53:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: You know?

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:15.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And this other
one, this other picture

00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:19.063 align:middle line:84%
that you shared with us
is, is the -- what is this?

00:53:19.063 --> 00:53:20.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well this
is [foreign word] he's the God

00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:21.666 align:middle line:90%
of Healing.

00:53:21.666 --> 00:53:24.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: God of Healing.

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:27.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And he has in
his hand the pill of immorality

00:53:27.605 --> 00:53:29.006 align:middle line:84%
which is like a -- what
they call these days --

00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:30.274 align:middle line:90%
they call them a super pill.

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:32.843 align:middle line:84%
Which means that it's got
the combination of all

00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:35.746 align:middle line:84%
of the major great
anti-aging, longevity,

00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:37.581 align:middle line:90%
enlightening herbs in one pill.

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:38.783 align:middle line:90%
And you can just see the,

00:53:38.783 --> 00:53:41.819 align:middle line:84%
the joy in his face
as he sees this pill.

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:43.954 align:middle line:84%
Also he's got a gourd
hanging from his back

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
which has the liquid
version of this

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.326 align:middle line:90%
which he drank on a daily basis.

00:53:48.326 --> 00:53:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Inaudible]
the tonic.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So he
would have the tonic --

00:53:50.494 --> 00:53:52.563 align:middle line:84%
well the tonic is a
type of herbalism.

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:55.333 align:middle line:84%
But there can be a liquid
or there can be a pill form.

00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:57.268 align:middle line:84%
So he's actually carrying
two different kinds here.

00:53:57.268 --> 00:53:58.169 align:middle line:84%
He's -- but right at
the moment he's...

00:53:58.169 --> 00:53:59.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting.

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:00.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...has
this magical pill [inaudible].

00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:02.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
now we have you

00:54:02.506 --> 00:54:05.109 align:middle line:84%
in a picture here in
the Reishi fields.

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah,
that's a Reishi tent in the --

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.579 align:middle line:84%
at the base of Chung
Bi Mountain.

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.881 align:middle line:84%
It's where we get
our wild Reishi.

00:54:10.881 --> 00:54:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of the kinds of wild
Reishi but this one is --

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.719 align:middle line:90%
this is a pretty old picture.

00:54:14.719 --> 00:54:18.255 align:middle line:84%
They've become more
organized than this.

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:19.924 align:middle line:90%
But this was a beautiful...

00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:21.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wonderful.

00:54:21.058 --> 00:54:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
...tent back in the 1990's

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:24.729 align:middle line:90%
at some point I think.

00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:28.499 align:middle line:84%
And I just -- this was -- this
is in Chun Bi Mountain and we're

00:54:28.499 --> 00:54:31.369 align:middle line:84%
in -- I'm in a Ras- -- that's
how they grow -- now these --

00:54:31.369 --> 00:54:32.737 align:middle line:84%
they're not growing
in the ground.

00:54:32.737 --> 00:54:34.839 align:middle line:84%
They're growing on logs that
were cut down from the forest

00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:36.273 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually
-- so all they do is...

00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I see.

00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:38.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...it's
actually just fresh air, water.

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:39.844 align:middle line:84%
They said it's against the
law to give it any kind

00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:41.011 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals or fertilizers.

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:41.979 align:middle line:90%
They don't need anything.

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:43.381 align:middle line:84%
They can't spray
it with fungicides.

00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:45.016 align:middle line:90%
It's just naturally grown.

00:54:45.016 --> 00:54:46.283 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the Reishi's.

00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And that is
one of the ones that grown

00:54:47.585 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:84%
which looks very similar to
the one here on our table.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:54:50.087 --> 00:54:50.755 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:54:50.755 --> 00:54:51.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:52.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: This was...

00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:53.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now is this
preserved in some certain way?

00:54:53.557 --> 00:54:54.392 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a...

00:54:54.392 --> 00:54:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: No.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.062 align:middle line:84%
They produ- -- when they get
to maturity they become glossy.

00:54:58.062 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're called glossy
Ganoderma or Ganoderma Lucida.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.201 align:middle line:90%
Lucid like shiny.

00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:04.969 align:middle line:90%
They...

00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:06.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Interesting.

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: So all this
beautiful sheen just means

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually achieved
a certain state of maturity.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:13.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, wow.

00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:15.079 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:18.716 align:middle line:84%
So these are all things that
you've boiled down or created

00:55:18.716 --> 00:55:21.285 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your work
at Dragon Herbs right?

00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And you have
emporiums which are beautiful.

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:25.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Thank you.

00:55:25.222 --> 00:55:26.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: We have a
picture of one of the emporiums

00:55:26.023 --> 00:55:27.391 align:middle line:90%
that you -- what is that?

00:55:27.391 --> 00:55:28.526 align:middle line:90%
That is gorgeous.

00:55:28.526 --> 00:55:29.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well
that's our exlire bar.

00:55:29.727 --> 00:55:31.962 align:middle line:84%
You come in there and when
you're in Los Angeles --

00:55:31.962 --> 00:55:36.667 align:middle line:84%
this is the one on Robertson
and you get to order a drink,

00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.669 align:middle line:84%
and all those different
drink wells

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:40.304 align:middle line:84%
in the background they're
called tonic wells.

00:55:40.304 --> 00:55:42.273 align:middle line:90%
We have different extracts.

00:55:42.273 --> 00:55:43.707 align:middle line:90%
Those are my babies.

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.775 align:middle line:90%
Every one of them has something

00:55:44.775 --> 00:55:47.745 align:middle line:84%
that I spent years
collecting the herb for.

00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:50.514 align:middle line:84%
They're extracted using
that special technology

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:54.819 align:middle line:84%
that is cool -- they're raw but
they're completely extracted.

00:55:54.819 --> 00:55:56.086 align:middle line:84%
It's the only technology
in the world

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.522 align:middle line:90%
that is completely raw too.

00:55:58.522 --> 00:55:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What
is that called again?

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:01.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's called
-- it's called FITT, F-I --

00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:05.162 align:middle line:84%
Fingerprint Identical Transfer
Technology and we sell them

00:56:05.162 --> 00:56:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to people in a form called
E Tea which is like this.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.803 align:middle line:84%
So they're -- E Tea stands
for easy, economical,

00:56:12.803 --> 00:56:14.672 align:middle line:90%
effective and ecological tea.

00:56:14.672 --> 00:56:17.274 align:middle line:84%
They're completely organic,
they're not -- they're --

00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:19.677 align:middle line:90%
there's no carbon footprint.

00:56:19.677 --> 00:56:20.978 align:middle line:90%
They're exactly the same

00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:23.981 align:middle line:84%
as if you ate the plant off
the vine or off the bush.

00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:24.615 align:middle line:90%
It's identical.

00:56:24.615 --> 00:56:25.716 align:middle line:90%
That's why...

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:26.951 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And you
created this system?

00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:28.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well we,
we, we were lucky enough

00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:31.489 align:middle line:84%
that I actually helped some
people out who ended up --

00:56:31.489 --> 00:56:34.291 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese Academy of Sciences
and they invented the system

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.727 align:middle line:84%
and so they've given me the
rights to it to America.

00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:37.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wonderful.

00:56:37.962 --> 00:56:38.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's one
of those coincidences...

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:39.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wonderful.

00:56:39.964 --> 00:56:40.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: ...but
it's an amazing thing, yeah.

00:56:40.798 --> 00:56:41.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Well thank you.

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:42.466 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing some E Tea here.

00:56:42.466 --> 00:56:43.734 align:middle line:90%
What is this [laughter]?

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:44.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: This is
my Schisandra E Tea so...

00:56:44.869 --> 00:56:46.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And this
is for focus [laughter]?

00:56:46.537 --> 00:56:47.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: That's right.

00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:48.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
clarity [laughter].

00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:49.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: That's --

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.976 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the herbs that Magu
was serving to those men for --

00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.211 align:middle line:84%
to live long and
become enlightened.

00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:55.246 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
prosper [laughter].

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.181 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden:
Yeah [laughter].

00:56:57.181 --> 00:56:58.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well
thank you so much.

00:56:58.482 --> 00:57:01.252 align:middle line:84%
You have to drink in order
to -- after you toast right?

00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:02.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Yeah.

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:03.487 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for having me.

00:57:03.487 --> 00:57:04.121 align:middle line:90%
