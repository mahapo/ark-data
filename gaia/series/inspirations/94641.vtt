[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean
to have an open heart?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you make your decisions
more with your mind

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:90%
or with your heart?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, how does the soul
play into that conversation?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.751 align:middle line:84%
Are the soul and
the heart connected?

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the questions that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:84%
were inspired by my
guest, Mark Nepo, who

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
is a poet, a philosopher,
and a cancer survivor.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And he has been
uncovering a path

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual inquiry
for more than 40 years.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.921 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK NEPO: Well, thank you.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be with you.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So how do you begin a journey
of a spiritual inquiry?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you start on that path?

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you wake up in
the morning and say,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.235 align:middle line:84%
I really want to go on a
deep dive into my soul?

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I think that the
language we put to these things

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:90%
is in retrospect.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Even as a child, I felt
connected to everything

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So even as a child, I felt like
nature, even cities, people

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:90%
that-- strange.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like things
were talking to me.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did it make you
feel different as a child,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
not-- did you feel like you
fit in as a child or no?

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Not completely.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thing, you
know, the great philosopher

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Kierkegaard said we're
all spies for God.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has their innate
connection to life.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when we're
born as little infants,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the first thing-- we know
this oneness from the womb.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
subject or object.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.659 align:middle line:90%
There's no I, you, me, or mine.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Separation, yeah.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: But one of
the paradoxes of life

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is that in order to
be here in the world,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to be a spirit in a
body in time on Earth,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
we have to start learning
how to differentiate.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And now, oh, this is me.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.854 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's you.

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And then we
start-- it starts

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
unfolding the life
of relationship.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's fascinating
that all along the way,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
we're asked to keep that
connection of oneness

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:90%
in our heart.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And everyone,
whatever tradition,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
whoever you think of
as the sages or saints,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
they all recover
that oneness where

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
they say-- Krishnamurti
said, there are no others.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
There are no others.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.555 align:middle line:90%
It's just us.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
interesting, though.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we, as adolescents,
strive for that independence.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to push the parent away
and become our own individual.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to do.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.587 align:middle line:90%
So it's very-- it's paradoxical.

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Oh, yeah, let's
talk-- and a lot, I think,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
of what we'll talk
about is about paradox,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
because paradox has just
been my greatest teacher.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's just offer that
paradox is any moment where

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
more than one thing is
true at the same time.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And the mind
can't solve paradox.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
As great a gift as
it is, only the heart

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
in great love and
great suffering,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.867 align:middle line:84%
sometimes force us to open our
heart and take in what-- we go,

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:90%
That can't be true.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're asked to let it in our
heart so the logic of the heart

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:90%
can show itself.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And we are jarred
into understandings

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:90%
that we would probably avoid.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
So we do need to individuate.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We do need to find
out, OK, who am I?

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And then as life
goes on, we are asked

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to find, how are we the
same now that I have a self?

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
journey of compassion.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What you
said is so important,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and it just hit
through to my heart

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
about there are more
than one thing that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
is true at the same time.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
We are taught we are in an
either/or world, or this

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:90%
or that world.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We are not in an
"and" conversation.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.129 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: It's always.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the great
teachers for me in-- I'm 63,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
but one of the great teachers
in the last 10 years for me

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.396 align:middle line:84%
has been this paradox
that all things are true.

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:28.896 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:29.715 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And I write about
that in the new book.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Not that all things are fair,
not that all things are just,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%
but all things contain truth.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And the heart, as we get-- as
we're here longer and longer,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the heart is asked to
absorb and integrate

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:90%
the truth of all things.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Because from that
place, when I do

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
have to choose between this
and that in the outer world,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll make different decisions
if I know in my heart

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.084 align:middle line:90%
that all things are true.

00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how can
things like murder

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:90%
be true and thievery be true?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, so let's look at--
there are many levels of truth.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But just for our conversation
right now, let's look at there

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
is factual truth.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
There is interpretative truth.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's
all-encompassing truth.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
So the fact.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The fact is this is a
ch-- this is a table.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a chair.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Now, somebody
murders somebody or somebody

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:90%
steals something from someone.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they stole
it is factually true.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we start say-- asking,
why did they do that?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And you, who know the
person, say, well,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.854 align:middle line:90%
they've got an addiction.

00:05:46.854 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
They've got a problem.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.689 align:middle line:84%
Or they're-- even better,
they don't have money to feed

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.605 align:middle line:84%
their children and they're
stealing it to feed

00:05:53.605 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:90%
their children.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I might say, but
that doesn't make it right.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in
interpretive truth.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to understand
why does this happen.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
The fact that someone has done
something horrible or terrible

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or stealing is true in
the fact that it happened.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the
all-encompassing truth

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.955 align:middle line:84%
And we need-- you know,
this leads us into--

00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and I learned this
through my cancer journey.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But later I learned that in the
Buddhist trad-- and by the way,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
from my writing it's
probably obvious,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:90%
but I'm a student of all paths.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I was raised Jewish, but I am
a student of all paths trying--

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I've spent all these years,
all my books, all my teaching

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
the common center

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and to praise and make available
the unique gifts of each one.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.514 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So who is God to you?

00:07:01.514 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: God?

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
God is the unnameable
unity that's

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
larger than any one of us
that imbues us with life force

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and wants us only to be
as alive as possible.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it an energy
or is it a deity?

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, this is where we
start to get into naming that

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and everybody goes
to their camp.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So for me, if you believe in
anything larger than yourself,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:90%
you're a mystic.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we start to try
to name that, is it a deity?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it nature?

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it energy?

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.115 align:middle line:90%
Is it quantum physics?

00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you
separate each other.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.011 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Is it Allah?

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Buddha?

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I get older,
quite honestly,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested in names.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Find your own synonyms.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
What I'm interested
is in comparing notes

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
on how do we relate
to everything

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that's larger than us?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Am I a fish in a stream?

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Am I a star in the sky?

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Am I a leaf on a tree?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Am I a rung on a ladder letting
someone climb to their greatest

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
potential?

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I recently had this
really amazing epiphany

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:90%
about the God-like energy.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
the millions of years

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that people-- well, I would say
that the millions of people--

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I would say billions of
people that have ever

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
believed in a source
of the deity that

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
is a God-like source
or a God-like character

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and thousands
and thousands of years.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And billions and
billions of people

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
have believed in this
collective idea, concept,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
of a god or the god energy.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, is what God is.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It's that cumulative energy
moving forward through time

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into and draw
around you at any given time.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.837 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's a collective
energy of historical belief.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: So let me speak to that.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.711 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful in
a couple of ways.

00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:90%
One is a personal example.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.285 align:middle line:84%
You talk about how indigenous
cultures and ancient cultures

00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
would believe either in a
particular deity or several.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
In the last year, I
lost my father at 93.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I lost our
beloved yellow lab, Mira,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:90%
last February.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving this summer
in traffic, kind of stopped,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and it was one of
those contrasting days

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.429 align:middle line:84%
where there were dark clouds
but amazing light coming

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I love those days.

00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: And I looked up.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this lighted
place, it looked

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:90%
like there was a place up there.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.159 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's how graphic--

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yes.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.574 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --the
light in the cloud.

00:09:45.574 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It looked for a
minute like, wow,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that's a waterfall or something.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling
the loss of them.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know, I can
understand how anyone feeling

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
loss and grief could
look into the sky one day

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and believe there's
somebody living there.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What a
beautiful image that is.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: But now, let's
look at this notion

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of when we connect to
that collective source

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:90%
that you were speaking of.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is where
resilience reveals itself.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So let me say what
I mean by that.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So we are each, as
human beings, I feel,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
challenged to feel what is ours
to feel, not to drown in it

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and not to deny it.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when we deny it,
we know it all gets bigger

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't go away.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And the life of
feelings-- we can

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:90%
drown in one of our feelings.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And it can overwhelm us.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
challenges of being human.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Given this, when I
can feel what I'm

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
feeling to the bottom of
my personality, I touch in.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, when I can
feel the grief at losing

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
my father to the bottom of
what it means for me honestly,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I touch in to the
moment that everyone

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
who ever lost a father.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.934 align:middle line:90%
And when I'm in that company--

00:11:17.934 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what the bottom is.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: --I'm not alone.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Now, that's the
beginning of resilience.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So that whole idea of
something is bigger than us,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and other people have
suffered other than us.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And to immerse yourself
in that collective energy

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.029 align:middle line:84%
is kind of the same
as that God-like wave

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Absolutely.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And it's not just
with difficult things.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So the moment that I am
experiencing a sunset

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the
sea and I'm feeling

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
the wonder of this vastness,
if I let myself truly feel it,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I am in the moment that
everyone was ever stunned--

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.518 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --by the
beauty of the sky.

00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm in that company,
this is feeling eternity.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Not eternity as stacking
up years sequentially.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But eternity is when we
inhabit our aliveness enough--

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and nobody can do it forever.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:90%
We come and go.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%
But when we are in that moment--

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In that moment, yes.

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --then we are feeling
the oneness of eternity

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:90%
around us and in us.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems to be the
answer to human suffering,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
when we realize that we're
part of a bigger whole.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just us and
it's not a pity party,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
but it is part of an
entire collective.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Either suffering or joy or
spirituality or vastness,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
it really gets it
off of ourselves,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
which is where the ego tends
to grapple with and get

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:90%
onto-- this is just me.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:90%
This is my drama, my problem.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It takes it off of ourselves.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So this raises
another wonderful paradox

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:90%
that everyone has to face.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has to face.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So the one is-- side of it
is that as we individuate,

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
as we find that we're
here, and we're a self,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're excited
about being here,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and then we develop dreams
and goals and ambitions.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.565 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong
with striving for things

00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:90%
or working for things.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But what I have found in my own
life is that-- I know I have.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we
hold on to those dreams

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
too tightly, as if
they are the end goal.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
When I believe-- I've
come to understand

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that dreams are
kindling to throw

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
on the fire of our aliveness.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're not the
end-all fulfillment?

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: No.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They add to the

00:13:47.358 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So while our
dreams may not come true,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
by working honestly toward

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%

wonderful paradox.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: So the other--

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Let me go a little further.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's all fine.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And then sooner or
later, it doesn't

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
matter how gifted you are, how
lucky, how loved or not loved,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:84%
how connected--
it doesn't matter.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later--
how intelligent

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you are-- everyone alive
will run into a moment

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
when they don't
get what they want.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Many times.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a zillion times.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: It's not to minimize
or diminish what we want.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole process of
disappointment and loss.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But when we don't
get what we want,

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
it breaks our
self-reference, and we

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
are thrown into this
larger conversation.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's not just about me.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.076 align:middle line:90%
I am a part in a whole.

long time that those who wake

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.757 align:middle line:84%
are the students, but those who
stay awake are the teachers.

00:15:19.757 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are the
teachers, interesting.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: And how we take turns.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A-ha.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.489 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Is the same thing
as consciousness

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:90%
to you, awakening?

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yes.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I prefer the word awakening
instead of consciousness.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Because I
think consciousness

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
tends to place it
too much in the mind.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And awakening involves
our whole being.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Our whole being and
every resource we have.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, but why I
started "The Book of Awakening,"

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.089 align:middle line:84%
I was out of my
cancer experience.

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your cancer experience?

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yes.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I am 27 years on the other
side of my cancer experience.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Which feels--

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a blessing to be here.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a lifetime
ago and yesterday.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, at the same time?

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.534 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: I often feel like I'm
8 and 80 at the same time.

00:16:11.534 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I was watching--

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I was watching an interview
in "The Power of the Heart,"

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the new movie that you're
in, about your experience

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.805 align:middle line:84%
and how it was an
awakening for you.

00:16:21.805 --> 00:16:24.559 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in my mid-30s
when I came down

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
with a rare form
of lymphoma that

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
appeared as a tumor
growing in my skull bone.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And it grew very large, to
like the size of a grapefruit.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inside the bone?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Inside the
bone, going out and in.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And that began a
three-year journey

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.535 align:middle line:84%
during which that tumor
on my brain vanished.

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a miracle.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, I had a tumor--

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.755 align:middle line:84%
because this was so dramatic--
nobody, even me, didn't

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
notice-- growing on a rib in
my back from the same cancer.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so after I somehow
was thrown back into life

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
with this miracle, within a
year this tumor on my back

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:90%
was growing.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
And I had to have
that rib removed.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go through
very aggressive chemo, which

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:90%
almost killed me.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And I had to stop the chemo.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of was thrown
in, in my mid-30s.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I had just finished
getting my doctorate.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I was beginning to
teach at a university.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't yet have
any books published.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to be
a part of this world

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to help
change the world.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
life started changing me.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And you were a professor
of philosophy, right?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Of poetry
and philosophy.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I was turned upside down,
and humbled, and broken open.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.506 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
learned through this journey

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
was-- I mean, I
mentioned earlier

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
about being a
student of all paths.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And it really comes from that
because during that journey,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I've always been what I would
consider an open person.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't open until I
really was desperate to be here.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you had to choose?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: I had to
choose to be open.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So being Jewish, I had
people of every faith

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:90%
offer some healing to me.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And I accepted everything.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't debate about
whose god, whose tradition.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a Catholic priest
who was a friend,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to
lay his hands on me.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have a conversation.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, where, when, and do
it as often as you'd like.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And so waking up on
the other side, still here,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Jonah spit out
of the mouth of the whale,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I was not and am not wise enough
to know what worked and what

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I was asked--
by God, or whatever

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it-- by
everything larger than me,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to start believing
in everything.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what you came
out of that experience with?

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Was that the decision
that you made?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.406 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: It was.

00:19:25.406 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It was an awakening
that overcame me,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.685 align:middle line:90%
not a decision I made.

00:19:30.685 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To believe
in everything.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: To believe
in everything.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing that happened

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
that is that I've always

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
believed in the
heart, in the soul,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
in the unseeable mystery
of things that matter.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But before my cancer
journey, I have

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.734 align:middle line:84%
to say that I was
more in my head.

00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A little bit
of an intellectual?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:52.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I was more in my head.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.519 align:middle line:84%
And this-- again, I
didn't make any decision.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say there was
some wisdom on my part.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But I woke up and now
I was living from here.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, my
mind has served my heart.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.105 align:middle line:84%
The mind is a
magnificent tool, but I

00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
don't believe that
it should ever

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.941 align:middle line:90%
be given the keys to the car.

00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk about what you

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
said in terms of being
ruled by the heart.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: You know, the
proper role of the will

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.525 align:middle line:84%
is not that we
create everything,

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
not that we
manipulate everything,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%
not that we control everything.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's to allow us
from a felt placed

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
the living universe.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are humbled
through great love

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and suffering to
finally-- some of us

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
don't, but to finally
accept that fact.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The will tends
to run me, though.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.082 align:middle line:84%
Let's dive into that
a little bit deeper.

00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So let's back up
for a minute, and let's talk

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
about what it means
to be wholehearted.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And wholehearted,
to me, means that we

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
are challenged to open
ourselves in all directions

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:13.391 align:middle line:84%
and be as present as possible
without conclusion every day.

00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Every day.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.241 align:middle line:84%
Now being human,
who can do that?

00:21:17.241 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So just the way our eyes are
blinking while we're talking,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
our lungs are expanding
and contracting

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
while we're talking, the
heart opens and closes,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
our wakefulness
opens and closes.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
This is what it is
to be a human being.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But it evokes in us
the responsibility

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to inhabit and create a
personal practice of return.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So that when I shut down,
I know how to open up.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:90%
When I am--

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:90%
One day I can be so sensitive.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You know those days where
if you spilled this water,

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd be able to catch it
before it reached the ground.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And other days, I'll
spill it on you.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.073 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's normal then.

00:21:58.073 --> 00:21:59.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: That's what
it is to be human.

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:01.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:01.025 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: But how do I return to
being sensitive when I'm numb?

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
How do I return to being
clear when I'm clouded?

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
How do I return to resilience
when I'm feeling overwhelmed?

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
These are all parts that
only the heart can teach us

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
when it connects us to the
resilience of all other life

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and to the resources
of life itself.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So let me say one other
important distinction

The word "perfect" does

without flaws.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.656 align:middle line:84%
The word "perfect"
originally meant thorough.

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: To be thorough.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the original King
James version of the Bible,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:90%
that was mistranslated.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the word "perfect" in
Aramaic meant wholeheartedness.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was translated
as perfect.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was it perfecto in--

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: I don't know.

00:23:06.627 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it was in the Latin.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.501 align:middle line:90%

00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:11.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So when we
have been asked--

00:23:11.535 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We have been on a
track of miseducation,

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel, for 2,000 years
trying to minimize or prune

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
our humanness so we can be
without flaws, when we have

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
been asked by Jesus and
every other spiritual teacher

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of time
to inhabit our humanness

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and reveal heaven on
earth through being human,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
by being as thorough
as we can be.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Not perfect.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
That means that
it doesn't matter

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:90%
how well I tell you I love you.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if my voice cracks.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I need water, it's cracking now.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if I
stumble or I'm awkward.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that I
do it with a whole heart.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's about presence
and not performance.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
a business leader.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:90%
You run a major company.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to make decisions on
a daily basis that maybe aren't

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
so popular with
one group but will

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
help move the company forward.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you do and make
these difficult decisions

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day?

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You could be a parent
making a difficult decision

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with an adolescent, or
any of these things.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Wholeheartedly where
people are upset.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going after the
perfection thing here.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's
going to be messy.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: There is nothing
as messy and magnificent

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:90%

Nothing.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And whether you are a leader
in a business or a gardener

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
or a mechanic or a parent,
it doesn't-- or a friend

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
or you're bagging groceries,
it returns the challenge to us

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to have the courage to say
what is true when it is true

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:90%

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:90%

00:25:10.324 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It was so interesting.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
On the way to work today,
I had to get detoured

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.196 align:middle line:84%
because of three
separate accidents.

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But the accidents
looked very severe.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.110 align:middle line:84%
One whole road was shut down
and the car was on fire.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Three separate detours.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Three separate accidents.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I really took
time at each accident

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to just have compassion
for those people,

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
whatever they were going
through in that moment.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's all very, very
difficult and jarring.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
How do you take accidents--
and it couldn't necessarily

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
be a car, but things that happen
that are very shocking in life

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.147 align:middle line:84%
and deal with those
wholeheartedly, Mark?

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I think
part of wholeheartedly

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
means saying, oh my god, I
don't know what to do with this.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But not deny that
it touches you.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So surrender
is a part of it?

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.019 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, to accept the
full-- see, I have found that--

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.685 align:middle line:84%
and this is the paradox
about the heart.

00:26:03.685 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The heart is so
sensitive that when

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:84%
we feel things, good things
and difficult things,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
we feel, oh my god, I don't
know if I could stand this.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I--
and yet, the heart

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:90%
is the strongest muscle we have.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It is the tuning fork by which
we know the entire universe.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
how do we trust-- not

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
lose trust in the magnificent
resource that we have

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and learn to be ever
more skillful in how

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:90%
to deal with that sensitivity?

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So often, what happens is
we're in relationships.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.882 align:middle line:84%
And a good, simple example--
and this, I'm sure,

00:26:45.882 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
has happened with
couples all over.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:84%
This is where my wife has taught
me things through the years.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
together over 20 years.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere early on--
five, six, seven years--

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:84%
she was going through something
difficult, painful, emotional.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was feeling her pain.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And I so wanted
to try to help her

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that I started to try to offer
solutions and ways to look

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped and said,
I know you mean well,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
but you just don't
want to feel my pain.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And at first I felt
like, I'm here.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.236 align:middle line:84%
And I took a breath and
I said, you're right.

00:27:20.236 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And that will
never happen again.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And what she was asking
for is what we all

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:90%
ask for is honest company.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.885 align:middle line:90%
We can't skip-- see, the mind--

00:27:29.885 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't fix it.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --the will wants to
skip over the tough stuff.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, I can't
take her pain away.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And compassion, what does
that word literally mean?

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It means to keep
honest company with.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.492 align:middle line:84%
So if you're bleeding,
I can help you.

00:27:46.492 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:90%
We can call the doctor.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:90%
If you need a Bandaid.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
If you need water,
if you're thirsty.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But on all the things
that happen that matter

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
that can't be seen-- our
self-worth, our connection

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred, our sense of
loss, our sense of worth;

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't take anything
away from you.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I can only keep you company
and have compassion.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:90%
That is, be with you.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's what love really is.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what intimacy really is.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As we said
earlier about the heart

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
being such a powerful
thing and you

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.463 align:middle line:90%
were talking about relationship.

00:28:21.463 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Relationship was one of
the most challenging things

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:90%
to figure out.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
When you combine two people
and all of their history

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and try to make
it work together,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:90%
why is it so easily broken?

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it
builds the muscle.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Because we
are dynamic beings.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
That is, we're
constantly growing.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to grow,
we need to build structures

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and identities that we can grow
in the way an egg is incubated.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we grow, we
need to actually have life.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.216 align:middle line:84%
It has to crack those identities
so we can grow larger.

00:29:05.216 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Open.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:84%

00:29:11.782 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things-- and this has

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.698 align:middle line:84%
been-- you know, the different
traditions speak about this,

00:29:15.698 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:90%
but every crack is an opening.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, it doesn't
feel good to get cracked.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.647 align:middle line:90%
Nobody likes this.

00:29:25.647 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not advocating it.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's more like you
don't advocate gravity.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:84%
This is like part of
spiritual physics.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:90%
That we are--

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways that
human beings tend to grow.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And we do both.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Often, at the same time.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:84%
One is that we willfully
shed, like snakes shed

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:90%
and crabs shed skin.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And we are broken open.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And go

>>NEPO: We are broken open.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So for instance in
the Tibetan tradition,

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.855 align:middle line:84%
it is believed that
a spiritual warrior--

00:29:58.855 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:90%
not a military warrior.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual warrior,
that is someone

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:84%
who believes and is committed
to a life of transformation,

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
always has a crack
in their heart.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Because that is how
the mysteries get in.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
probably what causes

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
them to be the warrior,
is because they had

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that experience of
pain that caused

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.206 align:middle line:90%
that experience of growth.

00:30:22.206 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yes.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And it lets everything else in.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the Chinese
tradition, there

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is a great line in a text called
"The Doctrine of the Mean."

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Not mean and in meanness, but
as in the middle way, that

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:84%
says given sincerity, there
will be enlightenment.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.152 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
skillful or great.

00:30:44.152 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just authentic.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Just authentic.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So I had been drawn
through the years

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to look into where the
word sincere comes from.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's very helpful.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
In the Western
tradition, sincere

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the
Renaissance, where

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
we know there were so many
great artists and sculptors

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
and painters.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So there were also, like
hardware stores today,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.780 align:middle line:90%
there were stone sellers.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And fraudulent
stone sellers would

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
take a cracked piece of marble
and fill it in with wax,

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and polish it, and try to
sell it as a perfect stone.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.829 align:middle line:84%
Sin cerae in Latin
means without wax.

00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So an honest stone
seller didn't hide the flaws.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, it
became understood

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that an honest person didn't
hide their humanity, didn't

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:90%
hide their cracks, their flaws.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So not only they could be
more an honest relationship,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:84%
but they let the mysteries in
to touch our and fill our heart.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So
authentically, are you

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.439 align:middle line:84%
100% awakened throughout
your whole day?

00:31:53.439 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Oh, god no.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right?

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:56.100 align:middle line:90%
How can we possibly be?

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: No, there are moments.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: About how much
do you get it right?

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, even that I
wouldn't say get it right.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
we go-- we move--

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
see, rather than thinking
of things as true and false,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I think of things as
partial and whole.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And we move being human
into moments of wholeness,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:90%
and then we trip.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
The medieval monks,
Christian monks,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
when asked how they
practiced their faith

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:84%
would often say by falling
down and getting up.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.984 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:32:26.984 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That will teach you.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: I love that.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're having a
great conversation

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and this is-- I feel like
we're in a real sense

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:90%
of clarity today.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I can go home and next week
I'll trip over the garbage

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and I won't remember
what we talked about.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'll have to relearn it.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.016 align:middle line:84%
But that-- it doesn't mean
that I've done anything wrong.

00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:48.389 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: That's what we do.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.617 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Patience and simplicity.

00:32:53.617 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Patience and simplicity.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And Lao-Tzu was an amazing
teacher from the 6th Century.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, these
are three things,

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about in the
clip, that he-- the only things

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:90%
he had to teach.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And simplicity
invites us to return

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to being direct about living.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.430 align:middle line:84%
To removing whatever is between
us and what we're experiencing.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds like focus to me.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.360 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between simplicity and focus?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Again, synonyms.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
If that-- if focus is a way to
understand that, that's fine.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems
more harsh, though.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, simplicity is--
it was Oliver Wendell Holmes who

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
said, we go through
complication to arrive

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:90%
at the far side of complexity.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And to arrive at
simplicity there.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So of course, there
are things that

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:84%
are complex and complicated,
but we're always asked--

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:90%
and this is where, like, OK.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I was brought up Jewish,
I mentioned earlier.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And brought up like
every tradition,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
that they're distinct.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're Jewish.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.457 align:middle line:90%
And you're not Catholic.

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And you're not this.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And we all honor
these differences.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it took suffering
to break me and say,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:90%
there's no difference.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to what's simple.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.763 align:middle line:90%
We're all here.

00:34:15.763 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
We're all in
relation to something

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand
that's bigger than us.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:90%
We all suffer.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:90%
We're all helping each other.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:90%
Boom, simplicity.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Simplicity.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:90%
And patience.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Patience.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
We all have to develop our
very difficult friendship

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.905 align:middle line:84%
with our greatest
ally, patience.

00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:41.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:41.835 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Because I can say
through my cancer journey,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I had to make several
decisions over three years.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:84%
Each was crucial to my
being with you here today.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I had to say no
to brain surgery.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I had to say yes to rib surgery.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:90%
I had to say yes to chemo.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.835 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
say no to chemo.

00:35:05.835 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And from the
outside, they looked

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:84%
like I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only
path to be here today.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And the things that matter
reveal their truths in time.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you say
no to the brain surgery?

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We kind of passed over
the fact that the tumor

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:90%
mysteriously shrunk.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I
had-- I was scheduled

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
for a craniotomy, which would
have removed that tumor.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, would have
affected my memory and speech.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Which, for me, would
be like taking away

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:90%
the knees to a quarterback.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I might
have had to do that.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was also scheduled,
as a follow-up,

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:90%
to have spinal chemotherapy.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And I insisted-- I
knew that the tumor was

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.700 align:middle line:90%
fluctuating on my head.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: It was getting
bigger and getting smaller.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It was physically changing.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
doctors I was seeing,

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
no one would believe me
except my neurosurgeon.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
one who saved my life

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.162 align:middle line:90%
because he didn't operate.

00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you did this
through intuition that you--

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: I had a sense
that this was happening.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And I told him.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else
said, well, that's nice

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.700 align:middle line:90%
but tumors don't do that.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And we understand
you're in denial.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have done
hundreds of these operations,

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.528 align:middle line:84%
but I believe you
and we'll wait.

00:36:41.528 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And then I
had asked for one more

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
MRI-- I've had so
many in my life--

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:90%
to measure what was going on.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And that day, which
was October 15, 1987--

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:90%
It's an anniversary for me.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I woke up that morning.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.929 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to have the
MRI at 9:00 in the morning.

00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I woke up at 5:00 in the morning
and I knew the tumor was gone.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And until it was
gone, I didn't know

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because while I had the
tumor, in an energy way,

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:84%
it felt like a
tuning fork vibrat--

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it felt like a
vibration in my being.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up that
morning, it was still.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And we went and had the MRI.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And by this time, I had films.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was given a
second set of films.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.606 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the waiting room
and held them up to the light

00:37:31.606 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:90%
and it was gone.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
associate anything

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to that reduction or removal
or disappearance of that tumor?

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Was there a shift that
you made in your being?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, you know,
immense gratitude and humility

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding that I
have no control over anything.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
This gets back to the
conversation about the will.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I can participate and be active
in my time here on Earth,

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's an illusion
that we, as human beings,

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
have control over any-- the only
thing that we have control over

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.075 align:middle line:90%
is our absence or our presence.

00:38:13.075 --> 00:38:16.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So you live your life in
a way that ebbs and flows

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, but
yet, you still write books,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:90%
move forward, you do interviews.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:90%
You've been on "Oprah."

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And many, many times.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And this is how--

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't set goals
out into the future

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to want to be on "Oprah,"
you just move into it.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: No.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:90%
No, not at all, quite honestly.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
You know I-- about eight,
nine years out from my cancer

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.796 align:middle line:84%
journey I was going
for an annual checkup.

00:38:46.796 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
nerve-wracking because you

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
feel fine, but you
think, oh, what if?

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was fine.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent
back into my life.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking out of
the-- through the waiting

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:84%
room as another woman
was set to go in

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and she collapsed
in the waiting room.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And everybody--
there was a Code Red.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And people came to scoop her up.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
take care of her

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and there I was in
the waiting room

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.540 align:middle line:84%
after she was gone looking at
the door back out to my life.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But for a hiccup of God,
they could have scooped me up

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be talking
to her today.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So I have always-- I'm
grateful for everything that's

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.220 align:middle line:84%
unfolding around my
teaching and my work.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But I know it doesn't
have to be this way.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And I am just--

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Another paradox I've written
about in one of my poems

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is that there's nowhere
to go and nothing to do.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And accepting this, we can do
everything and go anywhere.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, that is beautiful.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely beautiful.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I have this one
last thing I wanted

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
you to take a look at with
Mark Nepo being interviewed

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
by Oprah about his book
"7,000 Ways to Listen."

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.005 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:40:05.005 --> 00:40:09.392 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.392 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: Let's talk
about the title

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of your latest book,
"7,000 Ways to Listen:

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Staying Close to
What is Sacred."

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
At first it was intimidating
because I thought, oh my god,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.894 align:middle line:84%
am I going to have to learn
7,000 different ways to listen?

00:40:24.894 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that much time.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.101 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: No, there aren't.

00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: So it isn't
7,000 different steps,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but there's 7,000
ways to listen.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Well, it's a metaphor.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: That title,
it's a metaphor.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.479 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: It's a metaphor.

00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And how that title came to
me is I was-- now a friend,

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:84%
but when I first met this
amazing linguist from Nigeria,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:84%
he was talking to me about all
the living languages on Earth.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.629 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there are
7,000 ways to speak.

00:40:50.629 --> 00:40:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- it was
delightful to meet him.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.253 align:middle line:90%
We'd become friends.

00:40:53.253 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I went home that
night in the quiet.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going to sleep and
my wife, Susan, and our dog,

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Mira, were breathing next to me,
I had this obvious revelation.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if there are
at least 7,000 ways to speak,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
there have to be
7,000 ways to listen.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me a
way in to the book.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: That's a beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful metaphor.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:84%
How do you define
listening, Mark?

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Listening is being, when
we can, as completely present

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to whatever is before us
with all of who we are.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:90%
With all of who we are.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: Yeah, that's what
you mean by 7,000 ways.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And we never know which
way will touch us.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the things--
and this, also

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor that I'll
share now, speaks

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:90%
about spiritual traditions, too.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we
spend-- we always have,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:84%
but we spend too much
time arguing over

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the primacy of one
path over another.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:90%
When--

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.289 align:middle line:90%
>>OPRAH: Who is correct?

00:41:57.289 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Who is correct?

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.295 align:middle line:90%
Who is correct?

00:41:58.295 --> 00:41:58.836 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:41:58.836 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:90%
And when we need every one.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:90%
We need every one.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So in nature, in
spring you think

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:84%
of how it takes thousands
of insects and birds

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to pollinate all the
different flowers and plants.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Each one is born
with an inclination

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to a particular pollen
that they then bring.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't find the bees
telling all the other insects,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.625 align:middle line:90%
we all got to be bees.

00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OPRAH: And this is
the way it's done.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Right.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so only when we do
that do we have spring.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, I feel like
we need every spiritual path

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to create the human spring.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So we need to listen for
what calls to each of us.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's been such
a joy to listen to you

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
for this particular interview
and just this time-- it's

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:90%
so expanding.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I could go back and go into
each one of the concepts

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
about-- perfection

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and about compassion.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're
also a wonderful poet.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a favorite
that you could share with us?

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Sure.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.546 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:43:08.546 --> 00:43:10.530 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be with
you and enter this space.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
believe that poetry

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
is the unexpected
utterance of the soul.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the
heart of everything,

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.414 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of
our conversation.

00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not the way
words are on a page.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's poetic.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.616 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this is a poem of
mine called "Free Fall."

00:43:28.616 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:84%
"If you have one hour of
air and many hours to go,

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:90%
you must breathe slowly.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.890 align:middle line:84%
If you have one arm's length
and many things to care for,

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:90%
you must give freely.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have one chance to
know God, and many doubts,

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.490 align:middle line:90%
you must set your heart on fire.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:90%
We are blessed.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Each day is a chance.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:90%
We have two arms.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Fear wastes air."

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, chilling.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:90%
When did you write that?

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: I wrote that about a
year after my cancer journey.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that sums a lot of it up.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.970 align:middle line:84%
That's incred-- thank
you so much for sharing

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.190 align:middle line:90%
your journey with us.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And you've given people hope.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And also, those
that maybe have not

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.016 align:middle line:84%
gone through the
cancer journey or other

00:44:27.016 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
struggles in life, you've
given us ways, tools,

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.151 align:middle line:84%
