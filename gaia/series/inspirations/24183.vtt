00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:10%
and we are coming to you
live from the Gaiam studios

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.660 align:middle line:10%
here in Boulder,
Colorado, and since this

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
is a live interactive show,
I encourage you to interact

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.492 align:middle line:10%
with us through
Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:10%
Many of you already
started that process,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
so keep the comments
and the questions

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:10%
coming throughout the show.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:10%
The topic of global
climate change

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:10%
brings up so many
unanswered questions

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:10%
about solar flares, earthquakes,
and a lot of uncertainty.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:10%
We're definitely going
through a cyclical change,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
but what does that mean
exactly, and how will

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:10%
it ultimately help
us all come together?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today
is Mitch Battros.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
He is a scientific journalist
and a psychologist.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
He's highly respected in both
the scientific and spiritual

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
communities because
of his unique ability

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.787 align:middle line:84%
to bridge the gap between modern
science and ancient texts.

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show, Mitch,
thanks for joining me.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH BATTROS: Thank you.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell us a little bit
about the solar flares-- what

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
exactly are they, how
do they originate,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and how do they affect Earth?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH: Well, what
creates a solar flare is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:10%
when two opposing electrical
currents on the sun collide,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:10%
and when they collide,
or several of them

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:10%
together, they explode out
into space in a twirling,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:10%
twisting, kind of
like a twister,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:10%
and that is what we see.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:10%
We see kind of an arc
and this stream of what

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:10%
looks like fire that comes out.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the initial
wave that is initiated

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%
from the connecting electrons.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a picture
of that, actually.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Oh, great

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Kind of an idea of what
a solar flare would look like.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's what a
solar flare would look like,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and depending on the
size, it certainly

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
gives us an idea of what
effect that might have.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's
different sizes,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:90%
gradients of a solar flare?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Yes.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, what are those?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.815 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: The least amount
of powerful solar flare

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:90%
is what's known as a C-Class.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
A C-Class is still
significant, but it's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.782 align:middle line:84%
unlikely to create what's called
a geomagnetic storm with Earth,

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
if it happens to
be Earth directed.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
that's the smallest.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: That's the smallest.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%
The next one would
be an M-Class flare--

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you could say M for moderate,
and it can be very powerful.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That could does,
almost every time,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
create a geomagnetic
effect when it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
hits the Earth's magnetic field.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
That's when you might see the
Aurora Borealis is often known.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.857 align:middle line:90%
The less-

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The most,
actually, the biggest one?

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, I going to
save the less incident that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
could occur that's not
as pleasant as seen

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful aurora, even an
M-Class flare could knock out

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
satellites.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
It could also disrupt cellphones
related to the satellites

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and have disruption.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the X-Class,
the largest class

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of the solar flares, that
can be really significant.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
That is when the potential of
knocking out the satellites,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
injuring-- whenever the
space shuttle was going up,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
if any solar events were
occurring, especially

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
during the time
of solar maximum,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
even as it was rising
up the Bell Curve,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
they would stand down.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
There have been two incidents
where the shuttle was

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
in flight and solar
flare erupted.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They have a special compartment
in the space shuttle

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.899 align:middle line:84%
that the astronauts go
in there for protection.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If-- if it that were to
happen when they're in space.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.055 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: It did happen.

00:03:57.055 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it did happen.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.074 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: And the same
with the space station.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
The space station is
not going anywhere,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
it's staying up
there, and they also

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
have a special
compartment which they've

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.497 align:middle line:84%
had to use several times when
the solar flares come our way.

00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
One of our Facebook
questions is coming in--

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
if you can see these solar
flares from a telescope.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Yes, you can.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
There are several ground based
telescopes, fairly large,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that people use, mostly in
the professions-- universities

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
or professional astronomers.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
There, at times, again,
depending on the skies

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and if you're in a dark place,
and what phase the solar cycle

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.474 align:middle line:84%
is in, smaller telescopes
have been known to see that.

00:04:40.474 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To grasp that.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So when have we seen these in
history, these solar flares

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and their different sizes
you're talking about?

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, it
happens all the time.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It goes on an 11-year
cycle which takes you

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
from a minimum to a maximum,
that's 11 years, and then

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
another 11 years to go
from maximum to minimum.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:10%
So really it's a 22-year cycle--
11 years up, approximately,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and 11 years down.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:10%
Right now, we are
at solar maximum,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:10%
or coming very close to it.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.974 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: We're at one of the
peaks of the cycle right now?

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH: We're at one of
the peaks of the cycle.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.855 align:middle line:10%
In cycle-- which is
cycle 24, and cycle 23

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:10%
it showed much larger
and more significant.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
There were solar flares,
several X-Class flares,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and one that happened on
November 3, 2003, that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
literally had to have
the space weather

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
center, NOAA, recalibrate
their instruments.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.716 align:middle line:84%
It literally pegged
their instruments

00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:90%
because it was so powerful.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They went up to X10 at the
time, this one was an X45.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Largest one in
history, but that's subjective.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What impact did that
make on Earth at the time?

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Luckily enough,
that happened to just

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
be rotating around the
eastern limb of the sun,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
so if you-- as you can see the
screen-- looking at the sun,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
solar flare you

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
see on your screen, that
is the eastern limb,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:90%
that part of the curve.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, that's
the western limb.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking at
the sun, it's opposite,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:84%
so the right side would be west,
which would typically be east,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and the left side would be east.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So it was just rotating around
eastern limb of the sun,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
so it didn't have the
full force towards Earth

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
when that X45 went off.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
If it had, it probably
would been every bit as bad

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
as what's called the Keridan
Event, which was, I believe,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
1857.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what happened?

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: It was so
powerful that at the time,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
there weren't telephones, but
the telegraph people that--

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
dot, dot, dot, dot,
dot-- it knocked out

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
several of the lines
or the power lines,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and on occasion, it would
hit the telegraph station,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.572 align:middle line:90%
setting it on fire.

00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.831 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: If it were to happen
today, I don't know what--

00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it literally
penetrated the magnetic field?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: It literally
penetrated the lines

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and traveled down the lines
right into the compartment,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
lighting the paper--
telegraph paper-- on fire.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell us
how this exactly

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
affects the Earth's core
when these particles come

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
into and penetrate through
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: What
happens is the Earth

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
has an inner core
and an outer core.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The inner core is solid--
iron, if you will,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
iron, magnesium-- the
outer core is liquid.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They call it a dipole theory, so
it's like a magnetic bar that's

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of Earth, so when
the charged particles come,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and it it's Earth directed,
it hits the Earth's

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field, most of
the charged particles

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
are deflected because
of our magnetic field,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of warp
around the Earth,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
so there's kind of
a tail behind it.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.514 align:middle line:84%
Some charged
particles penetrate,

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
problems are, in addition

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
to the satellites.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so now, when those
charged particles penetrate

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and they turn into
kind of a funnel, what

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
does that look
like in our galaxy?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
What is that--
what happens, what

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.274 align:middle line:84%
experience happens
in our galaxy?

00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Interesting
you ask that,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
because not a lot of
people are aware of that.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:90%
This is breaking news.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
This may be, at
most, one week old.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, good.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: This is cutting edge.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Astrophysicists, because of
the new instruments we have,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the new spacecraft we have, the
new satellites that we have,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
we now have information
we've never had before.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They just published their
findings, their latest research

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
data, that does show
a direct causal affect

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
pf our galaxy, Milky
Way, and the sun.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
That has not been
presented before.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Now people-- many
of the scientists--

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
had known about the
sun- connection,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.176 align:middle line:84%
but they usually described it
in descriptions of climate.

00:09:24.176 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Climate is in measurements
of months, years, decades,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of years.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Weather is measured in
minutes, hours, and days.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
That's changed in
the last five years,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
partly due to my research
and equation, which took it

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
from looking at the causal
effect from the sun,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
such as these charged
particles, and trying

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to measure in
decades, to asking,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
is there an immediate
causal effect?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
There is-- the solar
flare acts like a spike.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the first shot of charged
particles that shoots out.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.306 align:middle line:84%
That could reach the Earth in
eight minutes-- that's fast.

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
The one that does more damage
is what follows the solar flare.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
That's called a
coronal mass ejection.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a cloud of
plasma, of charged particles.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
That follows-- that takes
24 to 48 hours to reach us,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's what knocks
out the power grids.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so that then
penetrates what you say--

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field, and then it
goes to the core of the Earth

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and then emanates out in
terms of plate tectonics and--

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's very
close-- very close to that.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
What creates the
magnetic field to begin

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:84%
with is the Earth's core,
so it's already there,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
but when those charged particles
hit that barrier already,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.155 align:middle line:84%
then there's kind
of a feedback--

00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, I see.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH: --and a
pushback, however you

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:10%
want to describe
it, and then you

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:10%
have a backwash
is what I've heard

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:10%
it described in
scientific terms.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.859 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So you were
mentioning about the galaxy,

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:10%
that our Milky Way creates--

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH: This is so
exciting, and I'm

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.116 align:middle line:10%
glad to be with you to
be able to share that.

00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:05.031 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Us, too, yeah.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: It's fascinating.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm the first one
to have broken this story.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.355 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: On live
television, perfect.

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Well, absolutely.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That is that NASA
has now published

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that their findings
of the galactic center

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
has a source of charged
particles, always have,

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
they're known as
galactic cosmic rays.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Something is shifting
not only with our sun,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:90%
but with the galaxy.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They're describing
what could be a tilt,

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps the
spiral of our galaxy

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is expanding or contracting,
maybe a little bit of both,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
but the reaction of that is
this funnel of charged particles

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
appears to be strengthening
or tightening or becoming

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:90%
more funneled.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
that, this is where

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that some ancient
text plays a role,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
it appears that this
funnel of charged particles

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
from our Milky Way
may be slowly turning

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
towards our solar
system, which means

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:90%
we're in direct alignment.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mayan prophecy or--
really, I call it Mayan text,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's written-- that
there would be something that's

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
called a galactic
alignment, a galactic center

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and galactic alignment.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of my scientific
colleagues believe

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that that's already happened,
in 1998-- that may be true.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe that even
if it was 1998,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
not 2012, that there's this
window of opportunity that

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
could be years on either
side that would still

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.686 align:middle line:84%
have this effect, because
if you are you looking

00:12:55.686 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
at a process that's
slowly going,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
like when you have a flashlight,
it takes time to get through,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and it could affect
the whole range.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
There are some great graphics,
actually photos, again, because

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of our instruments
in space, that

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
can be presented
on your screen now.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not a photo,
that is an illustration,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
but that basically is
what it looks like.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You see how that funnel
is in the middle?

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
NASA actually recently produced
a video that maybe we'll see.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have that
video, yes, this clearly

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
illustrates what it is that
Mitch is talking about,

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.925 align:middle line:84%
in terms of this funnel,
this galactic alignment.

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
that video from NASA.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:14:56.933 align:middle line:10%
[HEARTBEAT]

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is a
video that NASA produced

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that shows what happens when the
flare comes from the Milky Way

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and hits the sun?

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's right, the
solar system is a whole,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and NASA calls this
the galactic heartbeat.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
As you could see from the
video, that pulsation--

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
there was a rhythmic pulsation
that comes from the center.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
These are galactic cosmic rays.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the pulse
is this stream, as you saw.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, the new
information, scientifically,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is suggesting that something
is shifting with our galaxy

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and that more cosmic rays are
coming through and heading

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:90%
our direction.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans, basically,
I think, have

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
said the same thing, and
other religions, as well,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
or other ancient
text communities.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:84%
This has a significance in
two ways-- one, if it's true,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
if what we're seeing
and is something

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
very similar to ancient text,
what's been said by the Mayans

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it becomes
somewhat predictable.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Now instead of kind of
not knowing and so forth,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
this may bring the
scientific community perhaps

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in the closer range in
communication of ancient text.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
That is what I sense
happening right now.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've been in the
middle of that convergence.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.538 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Right in
the middle of it,

00:16:40.538 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's been a tough road--it's
a very delicate line that I

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:90%
have--

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fine line there.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: --that I
have to go through.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to add to
this about the cosmic rays--

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
it has an effect on
the whole solar system,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%
but first it hits the sun.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The sun is what absorbs
most right off the bat.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
What NASA has found out, again,
within the last few days,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is that there's something
different with the solar flares

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing now.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:10%
A moderate solar
flare, am M-Class flare

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:10%
is powerful and can
cost some damage,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:10%
but you're not
quite as concerned.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking
for the X-Class flares.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this what we're
looking at here on this image,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:90%
something we consider a--

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, no, this
image is where it all starts.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I say that
now until we know more,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
but this is the
first time that we're

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
making a connection
between our solar system

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
and the galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, OK.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: My initial research
was the sun-Earth connection.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what
is the cause of Earth's

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:90%
cyclical events.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
That took me to the sun.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my third
book, I want to know

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
what is causing the sun's
cycle-- it's the galaxy,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
it's our Milky Way,
and that's what

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing on the screen.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so the
galaxy, the Milky Way,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
affects the solar cycles,
and these solar flares then

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
penetrate through
Earth's magnetic field

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and can affect earthquakes--
could this give you the ability

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to predict earthquakes?

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Is this what your
equation is all about?

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: It gives us the
ability to actually make

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
an announce-- it would
be a global announcement,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.382 align:middle line:84%
and we could say
extreme weather,

00:18:25.382 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know if it's going

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to be an earthquake, a volcano,
tornado, tropical storms that

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:90%
turn into hurricanes.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly how
it's going to manifest,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to
use that language yet,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
because we can't give you a
specific geographical area.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Only then would it be
useful, like there's

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
a tornado watch and a
tornado warning-- there might

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
be something coming,
there's one here, hide.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.994 align:middle line:84%
It would be reckless to do that
with the knowledge we have now,

00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
in that direction.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.243 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It would throw people
into a lot of panic.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.502 align:middle line:84%
But this equation that you
created is-- essentially

00:19:04.502 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
what we see on the
screen right now

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is what you're
talking about here,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
these are the solar flares
causing earthquake activity,

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
volcanoes, hurricanes,
twisters, all sorts of things.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: That's right.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The cause of, what initiates
usually comes in cycles,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
or it could come
systematically where

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
one begets another, that
is initiated by the sun

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and transferred through
the magnetic field, which

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
correlates to the jet stream,
which correlates to the ocean

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:90%
currents and the Earth's core.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
whole conversation

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
about global warming being
the effective pollution

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on the planet and
over population

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and our damage to the
planet doesn't really

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.451 align:middle line:84%
make sense in this
context, does it?

00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: In addition
to that, I don't

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:84%
know what's
happening-- this could

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
be part of this transition
to they use Mayan language.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the last
decade, I would say,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.325 align:middle line:84%
science was pretty
straightforward.

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't public access so much.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I've never, ever, ever
seen it so politicized

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:90%
in my life than it is now.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.139 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Global warming?

00:20:31.139 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: The science community.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: And, so
before that, you

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
had to go through a peer review,
and I've been through a couple,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:90%
and you get chewed up.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Any weakness you have in
your theory, they'll find it,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
which should be there, it
serves a very useful purpose.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
What seems to have
happened is there's

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
kind of been a selective
collection of people

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
who were in the peer
review, and as a result,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
this global warming thing
has lost its integrity.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of your audience may
know of Climate Gate-- what

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
happened with Climate Gate is
there was a whistle blower who

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
got into the computers of
the climate specialists

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and found some horrific
statements of documents

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and emails that show clearly
this global warming thing is

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:90%
totally politicized.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is it politicized?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Who's to gain?

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: It appears to be money.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
the carbon tax, initiated

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
by Al Gore, who is
the one who would

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
be raking in all the money.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
He is also part of who initiated
this idea of global warming.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It was 1977, just to give a
brief history, 1977 Senate

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:90%
hearing.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure the
words they used--

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.692 align:middle line:84%
I doubt they used
climate change, probably

00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
atmospheric conditions
or something

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
like that-- Jim
Hanson comes in, he

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
was contracting with
NASA at the time,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and shows this hockey stick,
which Michael Mann created

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
through computer
simulation, in other words,

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
guesswork-- this
is what we think.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Michael Mann, James
Hansen, and Al Gore,

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
who happen to be a
senator at the time,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
happened to be in
the Senate committee,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and just latched onto it.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
At that very moment,
or very shortly after,

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
James Hansen created the
word global warming-- there

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
was no such word before.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what do the
environmentalists have to say

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
about this, what do--

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.167 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: I'm glad you said that.

00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
environmentalists--

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
what I believe to be the true
environmentalists-- who are not

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:90%
happy.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
They got sucked in
to this-- I don't

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
know what to call it-- some
type of plan or something,

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and I think they were sucked in.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course everybody
wants a clean planet,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
want to be stewards of the
Earth, want clean water,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:02.514 align:middle line:90%
clean air.

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anybody--

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there is-- our
forests are being cut down,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.715 align:middle line:84%
there are plastic
garbage patches

00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the ocean.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is definitely an
environmental crisis going on,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I believe so-- I
mean, actually I'm not sure.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there
is-- I don't have

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:90%
any problems saying there is.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The question is, if we were
somehow to reduce carbon,

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.235 align:middle line:84%
because that's what they
point to is specifically

00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
man-made carbon
emissions, would that

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
make a difference on
this warming trend?

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
My scientific research, as
well as many others, say no.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Is our pollution having
a marginal effect?

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:48.025 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but my data is saying one,
two, three five percent, not--

00:23:48.025 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Al Gore, James Hansen, and
global warming et al say 100%.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
about-- our listeners

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
are asking about the melting
of the ice caps, various things

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that are attributed
to global warming.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Yeah,
unfortunately, that's

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:90%
happened many times before.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.887 align:middle line:90%
The Earth goes through cycles.

00:24:05.887 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not denying we're in
a warming trend-- there's

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
warming trends and
cooling trends.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We're in a warming
trend right now.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists and
people are happy we

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
are, that we're not
freezing right now.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.517 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a
cooling trend coming?

00:24:18.517 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Absolutely.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.266 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At what point?

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Some believe
it's already started.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
that, as well,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.685 align:middle line:84%
but how long do
these trends last?

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I don't think
there's anyone number.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I think there are cycles within
cycles, cycles that supersede

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.956 align:middle line:84%
cycles-- to take the
solar cycle, for example,

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:84%
there's an 11-year
cycle, 22-year cycle.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We hear about the 100-year
floods, there's 100-year cycle,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
2,300-year-- I don't
know what cycle we're in.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.569 align:middle line:90%
Hard to say--

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Possibly we
might make some headway

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.475 align:middle line:84%
into finding out
where we are, but I

00:24:52.475 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
think that's exactly
what's happening--

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:90%
we are in that cycle.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I do want to make the statement,
because so many people

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:84%
misunderstand me, I
would say there's not

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who do more
for environment than I do.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Seattle, and Seattle
is very conscious of recycling,

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:84%
the whole bit, very clean
parks, people do a great job.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anyone, not
one person, honestly,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
who's pro pollution.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I go further and say if you
find one, put him in jail,

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I could care less.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm really glad
you said that, actually,

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.905 align:middle line:84%
because there are a
lot of efforts that

00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
are going towards recycling, a
lot of efforts that are going

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
towards cleaning up our
planet, and that absolutely

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with the whole
global warming conversation

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific
community is having--

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:90%
it's about responsibility.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I think
that's wonderful.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The environmentalists
that I know,

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the ones who know
about permaculture,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:84%
who know about
sustainability, who

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
know about community gardening--
those are the ones who I think

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:90%
got cheated.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm on board with them.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
many other who are

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
on what I'll call the global
warming bandwagon even

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.425 align:middle line:90%
understand what's going on.

00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Here's the danger-- there's
only so much money we have.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
We can spend it on this
carbon tax thing, which

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:90%
gets Al Gore rich, or we can--

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you really feel?

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: --or we can
put it towards what

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe preparedness
for this warming trend,

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps a coming
cooling trend,

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and we'd better get
busy, because the IPCC--

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:84%
this is where I don't
disagree with them--

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the international consortium
on global warming,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:84%
or climate change,
rather-- they believe that

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:55.115 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the warming
trend, that some places may

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
be flooded-- coastlines,
because of the melt.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that's true--
are we really putting

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.067 align:middle line:90%
the effort into migration?

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are so many topics
that we could cover here-- it

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.451 align:middle line:84%
has to do with oil
and free energy

00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and those types of
things, but we're

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
that when we come back.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
more about understanding

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
what the ancient
texts and the Mayans

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:84%
have to say about
this trend, as well.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back, I'm Lisa
Garr, and my guest

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:10%
is scientific journalist
Mitch Battros,

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking
about Earth changes

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:10%
and climate change, essentially,
is what we're talking about.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:10%
What do the ancient texts
have to say about this?

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.730 align:middle line:84%
What do the Mayan prophecies
have to say about this?

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH: Yes, all of the
ancient texts that most of us

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:10%
are aware of actually have
written about climate change

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:10%
and cyclical events-- certainly
in the Bible, the Noah flood,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:10%
very well, I think, was
probably a flood, where,

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:10%
for whatever reasons, the waters
rise, to who knows how high.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Other events that
the Earth will shake

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and the buildings are falling
down or temples and so forth,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes, and
we certainly know

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of volcanoes, so I

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
think it's clearly been
documented throughout history

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that these cyclical events have
been occurring related to Earth

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:84%
changing events, such as this,
and also, some of the ancients

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:84%
go further, telling us
about something that's

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.199 align:middle line:84%
coming from the sky
that could be the cause.

00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is what some
of the Mayan texts were saying.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.379 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: The Mayans especially.

00:28:51.379 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does the
Vatican come into play

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
with all of this?

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.995 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: The Vatican?

00:28:56.995 --> 00:28:58.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do they have
something to say about it?

00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:90%
What does religion have to say?

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: They do, and it will
be a surprise to most of you,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I think, being a
Catholic boy myself, I

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
was comfortable with it,
but my parents were not.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:10%
It was 1994, I believe it
was, when Pope John Paul

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:10%
II came out and said, I'm
paraphrasing, that there should

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:31.525 align:middle line:10%
be no reason that creation
and evolution can co-exist.

00:29:31.525 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Now I know that sounds very
simplistic, and many of you

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:10%
are maybe saying, duh, but
for the Catholic community,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:10%
that was a shocker.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That they can coexist?

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: No, that
they-- yeah, the shock

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
is that they could coexist,
because the Bible tells us

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was created
in seven days, and so on,

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:90%
and evolution is blasphemy.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So to hear the pope,
actually affirm that OK,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
so there's evolution--
big deal, what

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
does that have to do anything
with creation and Jesus

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and God?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Vatican has taken
note of things like that,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and especially with
the new information

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:84%
we're getting, because
of the instruments,

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the now pope, Pope
Benedict, actually

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:84%
called a consortium
six months ago--

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, recently.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: --recently, of
the leading physicists

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He called them into the
Vatican, and the discussion

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
was about String Theory,
was about quantum physics,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was about the Big Bang,
what is happening out

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:84%
in space, the
universe, the galaxy,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.160 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be changing.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So as above, so below.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: I think so.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
religion comes and chimes

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.250 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation
that we then

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
have heard from
the ancient texts

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and that come in from the
Mayans and the pyramids,

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and all of that seems to align
with this planetary, cosmic,

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.120 align:middle line:84%
galactic conjunction,
essentially, right?

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I think so, and it's
probably not a coincidence

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that these events, which
no one could possibly

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
think could occur 10 years
ago even, are now happening.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all, as some
might say, in divine order.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well now
tell me how this

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.508 align:middle line:84%
relates to us--
what does this have

00:31:31.508 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to do with how we
relate to each other?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:84%
How is this relevant
to us today?

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, there's two
applied medical procedures

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that are being used
now-- one of them I

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about is
transcranial magnetic

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:90%
stimulation.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's been accepted, insurance
companies are paying for it,

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's mostly used for
mental health issues, emotions,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:84%
so depression, anxiety,
borderline disorder,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:90%
schizophrenia.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They put on a helmet, basically,
it's kind of like that,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:13.210 align:middle line:84%
with magnets that has a
certain Gauss resonance,

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and that has a direct effect
on the brain chemistry,

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
the neurons and so
forth, and they're

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.854 align:middle line:90%
having great success with it.

00:32:26.854 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it shows
that frequency

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.752 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on
brain chemistry.

00:32:29.752 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Exactly.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're saying
that these particles that

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:84%
are coming in that penetrate
our magnetic field actually

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on
brain chemistry?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I believe so,
it only makes sense.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We see it in the animal
kingdom-- where it plays,

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.540 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, the most
effect is migrant birds,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:90%
whales that are misdirected.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Any animal, I'd say any living
thing, that has magnetic grid

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
lines as their barometer,
as how they find themselves,

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is definitely affected,
that's been proven.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%
No one denies that.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
very interesting.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So this basically could
have-- it's basically

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
what EEG would do to the brain,
or its a feedback effect,

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.729 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I don't know if
I'd use to the term EEG,

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:90%
but something similar to that.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
An EEG IS where we get
readings and so forth, I

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:84%
don't know if an EEG has an
effect on the brain chemistry,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe this thrust
of magnetic-- of these

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
charged particles-- is
playing a role not only

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.835 align:middle line:84%
with natural phenomena,
but I think with us.

00:33:47.835 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So could this have to do
with a rising of emotions,

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.454 align:middle line:84%
what would this do
to our behavior?

00:33:56.454 --> 00:33:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Probably a
lot of your audience

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
is probably those that
would be described

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
as aware and
sensitive to energy,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and may have this idea of
a wonderful transition,

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:84%
they're real excited
about the coming whatever,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
but it might not go
that way for many,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
in the reason for that is that
most people, I would suggest,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.622 align:middle line:84%
don't like change, even
if it's good change.

00:34:29.622 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Understandably.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this makes
a lot of sense, yes.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Those that may
an easier time of it

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:84%
are simply aware
that change is about

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and can maybe better
flow with things

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that are familiar and
predictable, because it's

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
extremely disturbing--
we've all experienced it--

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:84%
a breakup of a
relationship, fired

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:57.230 align:middle line:84%
at work, torn relationships for
one reason or another, things

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
not going our way, it can
be extremely disturbing.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Yet there are some who seem
to just kind of float through.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I think those people
probably will say, hey,

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
let's go for this ride, but
perhaps maybe most of us,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.350 align:middle line:84%
it will be a bit
more challenging.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what's the
good news in all of this?

00:35:15.308 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: The good news is
that there is a transition,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.038 align:middle line:84%
and I think at the
end of the line,

00:35:19.038 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
if a person can simply
tap into themselves

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and simply stay as
true as they can

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to their integrity-- not
going to be easy for many--

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:84%
but I guess, in part, it's
back to faith and belief

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of something,
it's part of a process.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why I find
comfort in my science,

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
with cyclical events--
this is part of a cycle.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
a cycle that's

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.029 align:middle line:84%
coming upon us right now
with the Venus transit,

00:35:45.029 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that's
happening right now,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.904 align:middle line:90%
during the filming of this show.

00:35:49.904 --> 00:35:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
it-- what is the Venus transit?

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.486 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: I'm feeling it now.

00:35:53.486 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how does it
affect us-- right, exactly.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.699 align:middle line:90%
Talking about feelings.

00:35:56.699 --> 00:35:58.115 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Venus is
the love planet.

00:35:58.115 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Like so many things with
cyclical events, and this

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
being the Venus transit,
I would say it's something

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:90%
similar to December 21, 2012.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Many people think that
it's like a light switch--

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
you hit it and you feel it.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The transit-- just like with
the date of Mayan 2012--

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:90%
is that it's a process.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The Venus transit, if it's
related to astrological effects

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and meaning, it
would be a process.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.265 align:middle line:84%
In other words, anything that
would have happened already

00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is and will happen
even more after.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
In the science community,
they don't necessarily

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
see it in the way of
astrology or something

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:90%
that a person would feel.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:90%
They find great meaning in this.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Because of the Venus
transit, what it does

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is a couple things--
one is it gives them

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.800 align:middle line:84%
more information
about Venus itself.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Right now there's a space
ship called the Venus

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Express Satellite--

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: --that's perched
perfectly right now to gather

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:84%
incredible information,
but even more meaningful

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives
scientists an opportunity,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.420 align:middle line:84%
because of the
shadow it creates,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.979 align:middle line:90%
to look for other planets.

00:37:26.979 --> 00:37:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What we're
seeing here is basically

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
where you'll able
to see this from

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and what the Venus transit
is, but let's take a look

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
at the video so
that people can get

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.027 align:middle line:84%
a clear idea of exactly
what the Venus transit is.

00:37:38.027 --> 00:37:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: The 2012
transit of Venus,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:90%
presented by Science at NASA.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
One little black spot on the sun
sure can cause a lot of fuss.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Twice every 120 years,
Venus passes directly

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.310 align:middle line:90%
in front of the sun.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
The circular spot the planet
makes on the solar disk

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is not much bigger than
an ordinary sunspot,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:84%
but every time it happens,
it is a worldwide sensation.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
The next transit of
Venus is on June 5, 2012,

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and for the first time
since the 19th century,

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.780 align:middle line:84%
the event will be visible
across all of North America.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.490 align:middle line:84%
The nearly seven-hour transit
begins at 3:09 PM Pacific

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Daylight Time.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Observers on seven continents,
even a sliver of Antarctica,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:90%
will be able to see it.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Across the United
States, the transit

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is at its best around
sunset, a rare photo

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:90%
op for creative photographers.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Observing tip-- do
not stare at the sun.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Venus covers too little
of the solar disk

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:90%
to block the blinding glare.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead, use some type
of protection technique

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.620 align:middle line:90%
or solar filter.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%
A Number 14 welder's
glass is a good choice.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:84%
For some observers, the view
provides an unsettling sense

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:90%
of scale.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Venus seems so small and
fragile against the solar disc.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Our own planet is
equally minuscule.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Others say it looks like
a black hole punched

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
in the surface of the
sun-- very strange.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Transits of Venus first
gained worldwide attention

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.750 align:middle line:84%
in the 18th century, when
one of the biggest mysteries

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of science was the size
of the solar system.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It might seem amazing
today, but astronomers

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't know the absolute
distance between any two

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:84%
How many miles would you have to
travel to reach another world?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
The answer was as
mysterious then

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:84%
as the nature of
dark energy is now.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:10%
Venus was the key, according
to astronomer Sir Edmund Haley.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:10%
He realized that by
observing transits

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:10%
from widely spaced
locations on Earth,

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.330 align:middle line:10%
it should be possible to
triangulate distance to Venus.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The idea galvanized
scientists, who

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:84%
set off on expeditions
around the world

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to view a pair of
transits in the 1760s.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
The great explorer James
Cook himself was dispatched

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to observe one from
Tahiti, a place

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
as alien to 18th century
Europeans as the moon or Mars.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Historians have called the
international effort the Apollo

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Program of the 18th century.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, it
falls into the category

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of things that only
sounded like a good idea.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Bad weather, primitive optics,
and the natural fuzziness

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
of Venus' atmosphere
prevented observers

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
from gathering the
data they needed.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:84%
The distance to Venus was not
measured with high precision

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.370 align:middle line:84%
until two centuries later,
when astronomers of the 1960s

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.740 align:middle line:90%
pinged the planet with radar.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:84%
This year's transit is the
second of an eight-year pair.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Anticipation was
high in June, 2004,

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.580 align:middle line:90%
as Venus approached the sun.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.980 align:middle line:84%
No one alive at the time
had seen a transit of Venus

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with their own eyes, and the
hand drawn sketches and grainy

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
photos of the previous
centuries scarcely

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:84%
prepared them for what
was about to happen.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Modern solar telescopes
captured an unprecedented view

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of Venus' atmosphere
back lit by solar fire.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They saw Venus transiting
the sun's ghostly corona

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and gliding past magnetic
filaments big enough

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to swallow the whole planet.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
One photographer even caught
a spaceship, the International

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Space Station, transiting
the sun alongside Venus.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:84%
2012 should be even better, as
cameras and solar telescopes

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:90%
have improved.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.105 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, NASA's Solar
Dynamics Observatory

00:41:17.105 --> 00:41:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is going to be watching, too.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:84%
SDO will produce Hubble quality
images of this a rare event.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, one little black dot
really is worth all the fuss.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.252 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: So this is exciting--
this is something that's

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.230 align:middle line:84%
happening right now
as the show is airing,

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and where is the best place
to be able to see this?

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, any place--
it's still daylight,

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.990 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't make as
much of a difference,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.530 align:middle line:84%
as if it was night, such as an
eclipse or something that you

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
want the darkest place.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say any place
without obstruction,

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, it's
not a cloudy day,

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and you should visually be able
to see it with the naked eye.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can see it
from anywhere in the world,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.694 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: That's true.

00:42:06.694 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's not showing
in the northern hemisphere,

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.380 align:middle line:84%
so those of us here in the
United States-- actually

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.920 align:middle line:84%
about two hours from
this show, so you

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
have time to watch
this and go out-- it

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:84%
should be at its
apex for this area.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and then what
does this mean to us?

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:90%
How will this affect us?

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, I
think the NASA video

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:84%
was good in explaining the
scientific explanation.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.910 align:middle line:84%
For others, they
kind of see it very

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.790 align:middle line:84%
similar to what happened in
1987, which was the harmonic

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
convergence, that it
has some significance

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of a part of the process.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I was in the harmonic
convergence-- I was part of it.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I was in New
Mexico in the Manzano Mountains

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.510 align:middle line:90%
with the Sufis, true story.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, wow,
what an experience.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: And we were all out
there running around and--

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.502 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you get
everything you wished for?

00:43:04.502 --> 00:43:06.335 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, you know,
it was interesting.

00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.875 align:middle line:84%
No, nothing happened,
but it was fun.

00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
it's all about is fun.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.679 align:middle line:84%
I mean when this
happened in 2004,

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot around this and
there were a lot of pictures.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: It was very exciting.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:84%
We have some great pictures,
I think, here on the screen,

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
in this year will
be even better.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
an actual photo--

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.813 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: That's an actual photo.

00:43:28.813 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --of a group of people
watching the Venus transit.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Yes.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's great,
and here's another one,

00:43:33.574 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:84%
this is a natural
photo that was taken.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's right,
looks like maybe a 767 there

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
One of our Facebook
listeners is saying,

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:90%
can we feel this transit?

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Will it actually have an effect
on us-- what will be expected?

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's a very
subjective question.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I just told you my experience
with the harmonic convergence.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted it-- I mean I
was at a Sufi retreat-- I was

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:84%
there all summer
living in a tent.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
How much more
sensitive could I be?

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.230 align:middle line:90%
But it was fun-- I enjoyed it.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.585 align:middle line:90%
Could I feel it in that moment?

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:84%
My story is not, so those of you
who think that you're going to

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:90%
fell it--

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.144 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you
believe it, then yes.

00:44:21.144 --> 00:44:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: If it happ--
tell us the story,

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.554 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to get the
Facebook feedback.

00:44:24.554 --> 00:44:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nevertheless,
you can go outside

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can take
a lock, and here's

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.269 align:middle line:84%
a picture on our
screen of essentially

00:44:30.269 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to be seeing.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.143 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Participate
in it-- just know

00:44:33.143 --> 00:44:35.557 align:middle line:84%
that billions
around the world are

00:44:35.557 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be looking
at the same thing.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Venus is passing
between the Earth and the sun.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: That's right.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and
so now, does this

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:84%
have anything to do
with the Earth changes

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.975 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, or could this

00:44:46.975 --> 00:44:49.830 align:middle line:84%
have anything to do
with the polarization

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:90%
that we were talking about?

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Not that I'm aware of.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:84%
There are some
people who believe

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.720 align:middle line:84%
when there's planetary
alignments, that that

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.090 align:middle line:90%
causes Earth changing events.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what I know--
the scientific data says

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that the alignment
of a full moon,

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.090 align:middle line:84%
just our full moon
and the Earth,

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:13.740 align:middle line:84%
has 100 times more effect on,
in this case would be water

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
displacement, tides, than
all nine planets lined up.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So I can't say no--
I'm open to whatever.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean what happens if it
happens to be in the way of--

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and then what kind
of effect that has,

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.694 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if anybody knows.

00:45:34.694 --> 00:45:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
any particular--

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.970 align:middle line:84%
are there solar flares
going on all the time?

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Yes, yesterday
or day before yesterday,

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:84%
there was an M-3 Class flare,
and a following coronal mass

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:90%
ejection that followed.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's happening
all the time.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the Facebook
questions coming in

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
is asking if they
have a magnetic bed

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.420 align:middle line:84%
or if they use magnets
like magnetic therapy,

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
could this affect them
when these solar flares

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and these particles come
charging in to the magnetic--

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Good
question-- I would like

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:90%
to think in a positive way.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for magnetic therapy.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Those of you that are familiar
with Reiki and acupuncture,

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
acupuncture really
explains it all.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.860 align:middle line:84%
What acupuncture says is we have
a magnetic field that surrounds

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, and then there's
the energy points, meridians,

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and by the acupuncturist
manipulating

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.820 align:middle line:84%
particular meridians,
depending on the element,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.164 align:middle line:84%
it brings balance
back to the body.

00:46:34.164 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the good
news-- that's what

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I think this is all
about-- you asked earlier.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think that
my hypothesis would

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.900 align:middle line:84%
be that it's going
to bring not only us,

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:48.872 align:middle line:84%
but the earth, Gaia, back to
balance-- we're out of balance.

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, now, exactly
how would that work?

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.207 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Tipped over.

00:46:52.207 --> 00:46:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Exactly, but that is
the point, that is actually

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:84%
the point that many have
made, that this brings us

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.650 align:middle line:84%
back together in
many different ways.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It brings us together
in our communities,

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but how does it
correct us from being

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
off balance from a
perspective of our poles?

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I believe all
my research suggests--

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I have two books, and I'm
working on the third--

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that it's charged particles
that are the conduit.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Mayans call it ether,
they call it the new energy,

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.390 align:middle line:84%
which ether is really not new,
but the way they describe it,

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.240 align:middle line:90%
it is new.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Basically, if you
translate the language,

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:84%
it's the space between space
is how they describe it.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.154 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes guess who showed up
at the Vatican-- scientists

00:47:39.154 --> 00:47:40.820 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
world who were talking

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:90%
about the space between space.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Is there a connection?

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.974 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I see there's
many ways that it actually

00:47:46.974 --> 00:47:47.934 align:middle line:90%
can connect us.

00:47:47.934 --> 00:47:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So you don't believe
that anything significant

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.545 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen, actually,
on the day of December 21, 2012.

00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: No.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.174 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why
do you think that?

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, I
can only tell you

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that that's what every
Mayan elder that I've ever

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:84%
interviewed or spoken
to has told me,

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and I have no reason to disagree
with it-- it makes sense,

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
such as the harmonic
convergence, or even

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:90%
today with the Venus transit.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.346 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- well,
for some of you--

00:48:12.346 --> 00:48:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Earth-shattering
is happening.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: But what's
being lost in that,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.790 align:middle line:84%
because of Hollywood
and so forth,

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is that the process
has already begun.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.127 align:middle line:84%
This is-- it's a window, and
you go through this transition,

00:48:25.127 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that's what-- matter of fact,
that's the Mayan word they

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
use-- transition, and we're
in the transition now.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
some up and downs,

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you might
have a peak experience,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.830 align:middle line:84%
but I doubt it's going
to be on that day.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've spend a
lot of time with these Hopis

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and shamans, and
people telling you this

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.700 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily true.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: I have.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.680 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of my
uniforms-- believe me,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.310 align:middle line:84%
folks, I dress down, and I
get right in there with them.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Try fasting for three days,
that's a religious experience.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how long
would we expect something

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:90%
like this to last?

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Does it go into 2013, 2014?

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.750 align:middle line:84%
One of our listeners is
actually even saying 2016?

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, there's a lot
of controversy about that,

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and even some of
the what I believe

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:84%
to be highly esteemed elders
who are knowledgeable,

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.120 align:middle line:84%
think that the bad
stuff, if you want

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to call it that, the big shift,
may not occur until 2050.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I've heard 2015, 2016,
I really can't say.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the
transition has begun.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Check back with me in a year.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't see a lot
of fear are coming from you.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't see a lot of
conspiracy theory coming

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:90%
from what you have to say here.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I see what you have to
say as fairly scientific,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and has been validated
by NASA and other people,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.210 align:middle line:84%
other organizations,
scientific organizations,

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:84%
have endorsed your
work, haven't they?

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Oh, yes they have.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The effect former director of
NOAA, the space weather center,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Hildner, the
deputy director of SOHO,

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the European Space Agency,
the leading director

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:14.200 align:middle line:84%
at the Royal Observatory,
Tom van Flandern

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.420 align:middle line:84%
of the US Naval Observatory--
yeah, these are heavy hitters.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do those
organizations say that there's

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be a big shift,
and if so, what would it be?

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.950 align:middle line:90%


00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Not as of
this date, and I

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.630 align:middle line:84%
don't think it would
be wise for them to.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They really need to
be careful with this.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I had a big discussion of
omission versus disclosure--

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:48.100 align:middle line:84%
omission versus
disclosure-- and whether it

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.137 align:middle line:84%
be 9/11 or Katrina or these
big significant events, what

00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:55.470 align:middle line:84%
is better for the population--
omission, in other words,

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:59.990 align:middle line:84%
keep it down, or disclosure,
let the people handle it, tell

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:90%
them the truth.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what the answer is.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I lean towards
disclosure myself.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ultimately, yes.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That's-- my audience,
probably your audience--

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I just got that-- you know,
I think other countries would

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:21.000 align:middle line:84%
definitely have a better
adjustment then we would.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.060 align:middle line:84%
We are the most advanced
country in the world,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that's like a
double edged sword.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.310 align:middle line:84%
We've got the technology
that's second to none,

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.357 align:middle line:84%
but we've gotten
dumbed down a bit.

00:51:30.357 --> 00:51:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In what way,
what do you mean?

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I don't think
our intuitive nature,

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:42.190 align:middle line:84%
our true senses is working,
is firing on all cylinders.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I think we've kind of--
technology has its advantages,

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:51.030 align:middle line:84%
but I think it takes away
from our natural abilities.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:52.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
animals-- I think

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.230 align:middle line:84%
animals can sense earthquakes
or something coming,

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.430 align:middle line:90%
and they know what to do.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I think we used
to have that, too.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: You only speak from
some type of experience.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen
this, where there's

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:84%
technologies or intuitions
that are available to us

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that we don't necessarily
tap into on a regular basis?

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Every day, and
I'm guilty of it myself.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.360 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have my
cell phone with me,

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.580 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not texting,
if I'm not online,

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:25.550 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not writing questions
into Facebook, I'm lost, right?

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We fill every day
with such technology,

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.790 align:middle line:90%
but where's the interplay?

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:29.984 align:middle line:90%
Do you know your neighbors?

00:52:29.984 --> 00:52:31.900 align:middle line:84%
How many of you can tell
me who your neighbors

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:90%
on your left and your right?

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.575 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when we have this
amazing technology out in space

00:52:35.575 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that can literally
take a picture of Mars

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and transmit it back to
us, and these are just

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:90%
incredible technologies.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.760 align:middle line:84%
If you look at things like that
from a scientific perspective,

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.650 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense to consume
that information instead.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Absolutelt--
again, there's

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the marriage of the
two, and the escalation

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.725 align:middle line:84%
of Earth changing events
that I believe are happening.

00:53:00.725 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.387 align:middle line:84%
I think that's its purpose,
is the Earth changing events--

00:53:08.387 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes, volcanoes,
and so forth--

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.345 align:middle line:84%
there is a pattern
of escalation.

00:53:11.345 --> 00:53:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's going to
continue for a while,

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.380 align:middle line:90%
it's part of the process.

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it as
punishment, I don't see it

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:22.350 align:middle line:84%
as trying to hurt us and
that we're bringing it on.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I think-- well, actually,
we might be bringing it on--

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that it's here to
help us, that maybe

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:33.120 align:middle line:84%
if something was to occur that
disrupts our Facebook and all

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.260 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, that maybe we
might meet our neighbors,

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we might find
that we need each other,

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we might
develop something

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.570 align:middle line:90%
called a community, family.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, one of our
Facebook questions coming in

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is saying-- Margie is saying
if there is an actual pole

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.700 align:middle line:84%
shift that happens, will the
North and the South Poles

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.290 align:middle line:90%
shift?

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Yes.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.416 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then when we get to
know all sorts of communities.

00:53:56.416 --> 00:54:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Margie,
there is a pole shift,

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.800 align:middle line:84%
but that is not
crustal displacement.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.461 align:middle line:84%
The earth is not going to flip,
the magnetic pole will flip,

00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:90%
and that is significant.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.793 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What if that mean to us?

00:54:13.793 --> 00:54:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That means that
the weather patterns

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.545 align:middle line:90%
will change significantly.

00:54:18.545 --> 00:54:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a pattern of
events that take up,

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.260 align:middle line:84%
geographically, a very
short period of time,

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.580 align:middle line:90%
but to us may seem longer.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It could happen within
a 44-year period,

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and what we would see is the
magnetic north bouncing around,

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe at first just
over to Canada or--

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would
that look like, though?

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:38.891 align:middle line:90%
How would that affect us?

00:54:38.891 --> 00:54:43.944 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Literally, airlines,
anybody with GPS services,

00:54:43.944 --> 00:54:46.110 align:middle line:84%
all the satellites and
airlines and so on, they have

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.789 align:middle line:84%
to recalibrate their
instruments all the time--

00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.597 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Constantly, because
the magnetic pole is shifting.

00:54:52.597 --> 00:54:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do right now?

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: They do right now.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting--

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.191 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: Right now.

00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is all because
of the solar activity cutting

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.904 align:middle line:84%
through the magnetic field,
going down and creating

00:55:02.904 --> 00:55:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that resonant effect,
so this is really,

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.540 align:middle line:90%
truly affecting the grids.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: It is, all
as part of a cycle.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it-- the earth has
seen this many times before--

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.241 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: But it's
not catastrophic.

00:55:14.241 --> 00:55:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: The pole shift?

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:15.823 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:15.823 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH: No.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But the climate changes?

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: That could
be significant.

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.294 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're going through
not a pleasant warming trend,

00:55:25.294 --> 00:55:26.710 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
going to be worse

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.209 align:middle line:84%
when the cooling
trend comes myself.

00:55:28.209 --> 00:55:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there
anything specific

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that you do in your life to
prepare for any-- with all

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:36.799 align:middle line:84%
of your knowledge
and everything?

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: Well, you
know, I met my neighbors

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.246 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:55:41.246 --> 00:55:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was the last
time I saw my neighbors--

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.411 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH: I hope I have
one minute at to leave you

00:55:45.411 --> 00:55:49.740 align:middle line:84%
with this-- I worked
with the Red Cross

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and I worked with
FEMA, and I'll never

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:55.970 align:middle line:84%
forget what my FEMA
instructor said.

00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:57.940 align:middle line:84%
He said when a
large event occurs

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.670 align:middle line:84%
or when there's a series
of events that occur,

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:02.545 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be
the fire department that

00:56:02.545 --> 00:56:04.045 align:middle line:84%
comes to your rescue,
it's not going

00:56:04.045 --> 00:56:06.390 align:middle line:84%
to be the police department
that comes to your rescue,

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.630 align:middle line:84%
it's not even going
to be the Red Cross,

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.870 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be your neighbor.

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Beautifully
said, thank you

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.810 align:middle line:84%
so much for joining me
today, it's been a pleasure.
