>>LISA GARR: Are you going
through a breakdown that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:90%
seems to be lasting forever?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Are you being run by
unconscious behaviors

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.014 align:middle line:84%
that prevent you from believing
you deserve a miracle?

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if I told you there
is such a thing as a miracle

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
mentor, someone who has
figured out a formula for how

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to create the
conditions for miracles

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:90%
to naturally occur in your life?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
and joining me,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:10%
is the number one New York
Times best-selling author

of, "Happy for No
Reason," Marci Shimoff.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.488 align:middle line:10%
Marcy is also the
co-author of six books

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:10%
as well as a featured
teacher in "The Secret."

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Currently, Marcy co-leads
a global online program

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
called "Your Year of Miracles"
that I'm also joining her on,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
which helps thousands of
women from 42 countries

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:90%
live more miraculous lives.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, she knows how to
create a miracle in her life.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCI SHIMOFF: I'm so
happy, for great reason,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to get to be here
with you, Lisa.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lots of good reasons.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't always
like that for you, right?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: No, I was
not a happy camper.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I, actually, was born depressed.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How is that possible?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SHIMOFF: I had a great family,
but I came out of the womb

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:10%
with existential angst.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
The kids were all playing,
I was about four or five,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's playing
in the playground,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt this
dark cloud around me.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was no explanation
for it at the time.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.975 align:middle line:84%
And when I was older,
I still felt depressed,

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
but I was very lucky.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky because
I had a father who

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
was the happiest
person on the planet.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:10%
I call him my happiness mentor.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:10%
And he lived till he was 91.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:10%
And every morning he woke up,
he had a big smile on his face,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:10%
and his motto was, every
day that I'm breathing

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:10%
is a good day.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, Lisa, one day
we were driving down the road

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
together, and I looked
at him, and I said,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Dad, what's your
best advice for life?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and he
said, honey, just be happy!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.183 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And I threw my arms up into
the air in frustration--

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I was a teenager--

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, ugh!

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Dad, that's easy for you to say.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You were born that
way, but I wasn't.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he said four more words.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, honey, I don't know.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And I set my life about
to find out that answer

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:90%
to that question.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:90%
How can I be happy?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What a beautiful dad.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.868 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful dad.

00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's interesting.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Because some parents would
look at a child like that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and medicate them
or think they need

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
to be on antidepressants
or so forth.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And you worked this out through
love and through perseverance.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%
You really did.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I did.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been through a lot
of experimenting with,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
what's going to make me happier?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I did do a lot of things.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate
that I started

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:90%
meditating as a teenager.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
That was a huge influence for
me when I started meditating.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember right away,
something lifted.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So one layer of
the clouds lifted

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.675 align:middle line:90%
when I started meditating.

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why do
you think that is?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:90%
How did you start meditating?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I started
meditating when I was about 16.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so how
did you get into that?

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Because I had
been sort of unhappy,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I was searching for everything.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was back in
the '70s, early '70s.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I was growing up in California,
there was lots of cool stuff

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I came across this
meditation, and I just--

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:90%
something inside me said, that.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And it really, really--

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that was the first
thing that was lifted--

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.925 align:middle line:90%
a layer of the unhappiness.

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now we know all
about meditation increasing

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
serotonin, and
dopamine, and all of

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
these great neurotransmitters.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And you experimented with that
and learned that on your own,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you wound up
at the Maharishi Institute--

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:90%
or The University of Maharishi.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Maharishi
University of Management.

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was 17 years old and
ready to go to college.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I told my
parents that I wanted

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to go to this college,
where everybody meditated.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody did
transcendental meditation--

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
the staff, the students,
and all the teachers.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
it was kind of--

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:90%
not usual.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't usual.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.052 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It wasn't mainstream.

00:04:34.052 --> 00:04:36.302 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And they said,
oh, we'll go for a semester,

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and then they figured
I would never stay.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
It was in Iowa, so, yeah,
I'm not going to stay.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And I went there, and
I felt like I was home.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was
consciousness-based education.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just about
learning about chemistry,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:90%
or physics, or art.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, everything
was tied together

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
with this field of study
called the "science

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of creative intelligence,"
which is basically studying

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature, the
laws of the universe,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:90%
the universal principles.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And every subject tied
back to that science

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of creative intelligence.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And every day, all the staff,
students, and teachers,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:84%
we were meditating twice
a day, and it was really

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
about developing your
consciousness along

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
with learning the
objective kinds of--

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How ahead of its time!

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Totally.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was so
ahead of its time,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.995 align:middle line:90%
and it's still around today?

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:24.795 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It is.

00:05:24.795 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a fully accredited
university to the PhD level.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
just exactly what

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I needed because I
also was with people

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:84%
who cared about something
deeper than most

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of the superficial things that
people care about in college.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and then it
gave you a deeper experience.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Did you always have
an affinity for India?

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just--

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
did you?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I did--

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I started
meditating at a young age,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I felt a real deep
affinity with India.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went to
India a number of times.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Most recently I went
for my 60th birthday

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and ended up having
a second wedding

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.735 align:middle line:84%
ceremony with my husband,
which is a wild story.

00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you--

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah!

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.407 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear it because
the pictures are so beautiful.

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So, many years ago, actually at
this point almost 20 years ago,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:90%
I was 39 and I was not married.

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I was single, had
never been married,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and really wanted
to get married.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went and had a
Vedic astrology reading.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Vedic astrology is the
astrology of East India.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And the astrologers told
me all about my life.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It was so accurate.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
oh, everything's

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
great in your life, except
you want to get married.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah!

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, let me tell you.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Over the next three months,
you're going to meet three men,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
they're all foreign,
and not one of them

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.808 align:middle line:84%
is going to be your life
partner, your soul mate.

00:06:53.808 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
that never happens.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.463 align:middle line:90%
I never meet three men in a row.

00:06:57.463 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can go years without
meeting an interesting guy.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.207 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, it'll happen.

00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, and the
fourth man that'll come along,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:90%
he's your husband.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me describe him to you.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:90%
He'll have dark hair.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
He'll be Mediterranean.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
He will have been born
and raised in Italy.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:90%
He'll love dance and music.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And he will be a therapist.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And he will be six
years younger than you.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:90%
At which point.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's impossible.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I never date younger men.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't help it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
He's your destiny.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The detail!

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.377 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: The detail of that.

00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And over the next three months,
I met three foreign men,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
one right after another.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Two of them are
still dear friends.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I forgot
about that reading.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And then nine months
later, Lisa, I

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
was at the Omega
Institute in New York--

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:90%
big, big campus.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I was there for a workshop.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And I arrived-- as I pulled
into the parking lot,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.367 align:middle line:84%
there's a woman
getting into her car--

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
big parking lot,
lots of cars, a woman

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
getting in her car to leave.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.758 align:middle line:84%
And I had been
there a year earlier

00:07:52.758 --> 00:07:55.042 align:middle line:84%
and befriended one
person, and that was her.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:90%
And she's getting in her car.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I say, Kathleen,
what are you doing?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, I just
got off of a course.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm leaving.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But do you want to
still meet a guy?

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.805 align:middle line:90%
Are you still single?

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, there
was a guy on my course.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.382 align:middle line:90%
And I think you might like him.

00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you like big macho guys?

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, he's not that.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Then, she said, do
you like older men?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah!

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, he's not that.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I think he's younger than you.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I don't
really want to meet him,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Just as I said that, she turned.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And across the other end of the
parking lot, Sergio is walking.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:90%
She said, there he is.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I looked at his energy.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I've
got to meet him.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And she walked me over to
him and introduced me to him.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They'd just gotten off
of a dance workshop

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and before he said hello
to me, he danced me

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.992 align:middle line:90%
around this gravel parking lot.

00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:37.792 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I looked in his eyes.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
my life partner.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And he is born and raised
in Italy, dark hair,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
loves dance and
music, is a therapist,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and is six years
younger than I am.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.823 align:middle line:90%
We've been together ever since.

00:08:50.823 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And we got married in India.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.153 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You got married in
India the first time,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and you went back and
renewed your vows?

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: For those people who
are single, I have to tell you,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:84%
good Vedic astrology
can be really accurate.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It can.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.688 align:middle line:84%
And you've always been
a believer in that,

00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's always
worked for your life.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Some people adhere
to certain schools,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and that really just
works for your life.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I've seen it.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it work so
many times it's shocking.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in 1990, I was
told that in 1996 I'd

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
have a best-selling book,
and I thought he was crazy.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even like writing.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.475 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
in September 1996,

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.350 align:middle line:84%
my first book came out
and went to number one

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.475 align:middle line:90%
on the New York Times list.

00:09:32.475 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's all in--

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.155 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's bizarre.

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I love that you have this much
guidance, and you trust it.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So how did you get into
writing about happiness?

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
lifelong journey for you.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yes, yes.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, when I was not happy, in
my early 20s, I was meditating,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
but still I wasn't feeling
the deep happiness I wanted.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I did what a lot of people do.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.832 align:middle line:90%
I set five goals for myself.

00:09:55.832 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I set goals for myself.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.525 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it was five goals.

00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share them with you
because I think a lot of you

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
might be able to
relate to these.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I thought, this is
what I needed to be happy--

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
a great career helping people,
a wonderful life partner,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
fabulous friends, a
comfortable home, and the fifth

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
was the equivalent of
Halle Berry's body.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.413 align:middle line:90%
Now I have four out of the five.

00:10:20.413 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't have Halle Berry's
body, but I have a healthy body

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:90%
for which I'm grateful.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I really worked
hard, like a lot of people

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:84%
do, trying to get
all my ducks in a row

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:90%
so that I would really be happy.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And I accomplished those things.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.995 align:middle line:90%
I had a great career.

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I was helping people.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I had a great partner.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I had lots of great
things happening for me.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:49.437 align:middle line:84%
And one day, in June of 1998, I
had three books in the top five

00:10:49.437 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
on the New York Times
bestseller list.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I had just given
a speech to 8,000 people.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:90%
I had autographed 5,432 books.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
My client had a massage
therapist massaging my hand

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:90%
so I could keep on signing.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:90%
I felt like an author rock star.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
signing that last book,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I went up to my
hotel room, which

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.385 align:middle line:84%
was the penthouse suite that
my client had gotten for me.

00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I walked over
to the windows.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
There were these beautiful
windows with a panoramic view

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of Chicago.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out the
window, and I turned around,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and I fell onto the bed,
and I burst into tears.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I burst into tears
because I realized

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I had everything I
thought I needed,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
and I still wasn't happy.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I could no
longer fool myself

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
just the next thing was

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
going to make me happy.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of the end
of the road for me.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I decided,
no matter what I did,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I was going to find
out how to be happy.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And I pretty much
dropped what I was doing,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and I started researching
all the happiness

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%
experts out there.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed what I called
unconditionally happy people.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed hundreds of
unconditionally happy people.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
what they did.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And within a short
period of time,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:90%
it totally changed my happiness.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say, back then,
I was maybe a D plus

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
if you were grading
me in happiness.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.112 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm a solid A.
I still am working at it.

00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm a work in progress.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, it's such an
epidemic for so many people.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have depression
as an epidemic.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are not
a lot of solutions

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
other than medication, as it
being a chemicals situation.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're on
the medication,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:84%
you need something else that
gives you practical tools

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to enhance your
quality of happiness.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Totally.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's what
I found is that we do.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We have an epidemic of
unhappiness in our society.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
One out of four women
is on anti-depressants.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We have more than we've
ever had as a society,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:90%
and we're unhappier than ever.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's the bad news.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:90%
But there's good news.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is
that science has actually

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
cracked the happiness code.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.562 align:middle line:84%
We know what it takes
for people to be happier.

00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that
should be headline news.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we do.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: And it's simple.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know we're going to get
to share some of the things

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
with everybody about how to
raise their happiness level.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.755 align:middle line:84%
First, let's take a
look here at Marci,

00:13:14.755 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
talking about your
happiness set point.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: The
happiness set point

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
says that no matter what
happens to us, whether it's

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
good or bad, we will tend to
return to our happiness set

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like a thermostat setting.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:10%
No matter what we do,
unless we consciously

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:10%
change that
thermostat setting, we

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:10%
will hover around that happiness
set point, which explains,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.803 align:middle line:10%
by the way, why people
who win the lottery--

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:10%
you think, oh I'd
win the lottery.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
I'd be so happy.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would be
happier for a few months.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, you
will tend to return

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
to your original
happiness set point.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:10%
We actually saw an
extraordinary example of this

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:10%
earlier this morning--

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:10%
the most extreme situation
that you could possibly

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.852 align:middle line:10%
imagine that Elizabeth had.

00:14:07.852 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that it
was certainly within a year,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
but within time, she returned
to her happiness set point.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So the happiness set point
is the key to our happiness,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
and here's how it's determined.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:90%
It is 50% genetic.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:90%
We're born with it.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I did not get the
good genes on that.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
My mother's genes were
not the happy genes,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:84%
but my mother has a
great success story.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:10%
She did get happy after
I did all this research.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:10%
She was my Guinea pig,
and she was in her 70s,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:10%
and she got really,
really happy.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:10%
It was kind of a
miracle, actually.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:10%
So it's 50% genetic.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:10%
It's 10% your circumstances,
such a tiny piece of the pie

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:10%
and yet that's what
everybody is trying to chase

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:10%
after to make themselves happy.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
The other 40% is your habits
of thoughts and behavior.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:10%
Now that's what we can really
do a lot about to influence

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:10%
our happiness.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
this a step further.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Researchers in the field of
epigenetics studying our genes

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
have said that our genes can
be influenced by our habits.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
That means that 90% of
our happiness set point

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
can be impacted by
changing our habits.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:90%
That really is.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm passionate
about this and about teaching

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:90%
this to children.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have children
or grandchildren,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
with you some things

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
today that I want you to take
home, and show them, and share

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So people always ask me,
well, Marci, what do you mean

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.628 align:middle line:90%
by being happy for no reason?

00:15:37.628 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
you're walking around 24/7

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.892 align:middle line:90%
with a silly grin on your face?

00:15:40.892 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
You're just happy no
matter what goes on?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:90%
That is not what I mean.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:10%
Here's my definition of
being happy for no reason.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Happy for no reason
is an interstate

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:10%
of peace and
well-being that doesn't

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:10%
depend on our circumstances.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you might get
upset about something.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
You might be afraid
about something.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:10%
You might be frustrated
about something.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:10%
And yet there is a
backdrop of an interstate

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:10%
of peace and
well-being that doesn't

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.106 align:middle line:10%
depend on your circumstances.

00:16:11.106 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, you interviewed
people that were happy.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.245 align:middle line:84%
What was the theme-- what
did they have in common?

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So a
couple of things.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what's so
cool is that no matter where

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
you are in your happiness
set point, wherever you are,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:90%
you can change it.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is,
like, hallelujah.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.537 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
about happy people

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:35.995 align:middle line:84%
is that the only difference
between them and everybody else

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
different habits.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is
they lived their lives

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
in the seven main areas
that we'll talk about.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They lived them in an
energy of expansion

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
rather than an energy
of contraction.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You know the whole
thing about, there's

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:90%
two energies on the planet.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
There's the energy of expansion
and the energy of contraction.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you move
towards expansion,

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:90%
you can't help but be happier.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're contracted,
you can't help but feel bad.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Can I do a little
demonstration with you on this?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Because expansion
leads to possibilities.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.124 align:middle line:90%
Contraction, it's so limiting.

00:17:11.124 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It is.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:90%
So I want to prove this.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.795 align:middle line:84%
I love proving things
to people, so I'm

00:17:14.795 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
going to prove this to you.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.049 align:middle line:84%
And I actually want
everybody to do this with us.

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So I want you
to curl into a little ball

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
and get really
tight, contracted.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And on the count of three,
we're going say, I feel happy.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.769 align:middle line:90%
>>BOTH: I feel happy.

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:30.363 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: OK, sit up.

00:17:30.363 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel happy now?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: You can't feel happy

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.497 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:34.497 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: On the other
hand, when we're expanded,

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:90%
we can't help but feel good.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
So go like that.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:84%
On the count of three, I want
you to say, I feel depressed.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, ready?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.673 align:middle line:90%
>>BOTH: I feel depressed!

00:17:47.673 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Did you
feel depressed?

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: No, you can't.

00:17:51.602 --> 00:17:53.592 align:middle line:84%
So does this mean I want
people walking around

00:17:53.592 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%
like this all day long?

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:90%
No, they'll lock you up.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But what it means
is when we move

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
throughout our day
towards the energy in life

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.315 align:middle line:84%
of the things that expand
us, we start to feel better.

00:18:06.315 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do we
know what that is?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.113 align:middle line:90%
What expands us?

00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:90%
What's a good example?

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So I found that there
are 21 main happiness habits,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and they fall into
seven categories.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to look at are
these seven categories in life.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard for people to
remember seven of anything.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So I created a little
metaphor for it.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called building your
inner home for happiness.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And a home has seven elements.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It's got a foundation, four
corner pillars, a roof,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and a garden.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And here's how your inner
home for happiness looks.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
think about, where

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
are you the weakest in this?

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.638 align:middle line:84%
What are the areas
you're the weakest in?

00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:43.905 align:middle line:90%
Where are you the strongest?

00:18:43.905 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because where
you're going to get

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
the most change is by
starting in the area where

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
you're the weakest.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great awareness.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yep.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So the foundation
is taking responsibility

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:90%
for your happiness.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.242 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's not always easy.

00:18:56.242 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: That's where you
go, you can't blame anything.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:90%
You can't complain about things.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel shame, which
is blaming yourself-- blaming,

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:90%
shaming, and complaining.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Their victim behaviors.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:90%
They will not make you happy.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's taking responsibility
for your happiness is,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
not blaming, shaming, or
complaining, but saying,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I can take charge of raising
my happiness set point.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.468 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:19:18.468 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Really
important place to start.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you're
building your inner home.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It is.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not saying, I'll be
happier when I get married,

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or I'll be happier when I have a
better job, or make more money.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.412 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or, I'm not
happy because this, that,

00:19:31.412 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and the other thing happened.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:90%
That's being a victim.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Then, there's the
pillar of the mind, the heart,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%
the body, and the soul.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The pillar of the
mind, you know well.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about having the
thoughts, the neural pathways

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:90%
of happiness.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The heart is about
feeling gratitude,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
living with an open heart--

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
gratitude, loving
kindness, forgiveness.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The body is having the
biochemistry of happiness,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
having the right
serotonin and dopamine.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The soul is feeling
connected to the greater

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
energy of life, feeling
connected to your spirit.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.205 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
roof of your home

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
for happiness, which is
about purpose, living

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:90%
a purpose-filled life.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.445 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the garden
is about your people

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
who you're surrounded with.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now the four pillars,
the brain, and the soul,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and the heart--

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
it's all things that
you can do in the body

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually do to
enhance the happiness, right?

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Every one
of those seven areas

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
has specific habits
that you can practice

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.915 align:middle line:84%
to raise your happiness
set point as it

00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
relates to that area.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Because here's what I've seen.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
People might be really great
at surrounding themselves

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
with wonderful people
or taking responsibility

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:90%
for their happiness.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But they're really bad
about their thoughts,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
or they're doing work that's
not passionate for them.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We're only as strong
as our weakest area.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say, take a look
at which of those seven areas

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:90%
are you the weakest in?

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And then start there.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was the body.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have enough serotonin.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why I was
unhappy as a kid.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
biochemistry of happiness.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It was that, for me,
and also my thoughts.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Those got me tripped up.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.105 align:middle line:84%
And when I addressed those
two areas, everything changed.

00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you
address the serotonin?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.317 align:middle line:84%
Did you do things
that stimulated?

00:21:20.317 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I did-- a
lot of natural things

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:90%
that stimulated serotonin.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I did exercise.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I started doing
exercise that I loved,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.495 align:middle line:84%
not exercise that I
hated because when you're

00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:33.078 align:middle line:84%
hating what you're doing, that's
not great for your serotonin.

00:21:33.078 --> 00:21:34.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's
exercise you hate?

00:21:34.485 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Well,
I'm sorry, Lisa.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I know you're a bicycle fanatic.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't like bike riding!

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Zumba person.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I love dancing, and Zumba--

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do, too, yeah.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: So exercise.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
There are specific, like--

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I do a meditation called a
"sunning meditation," that

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
takes a minute and a half, and
it increases your serotonin

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:90%
by stimulating the pineal gland.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you imagine the sun?

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: No,
you stand outside.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I learned this from a chi
gong master, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.253 align:middle line:84%
You stand outside with
your eyes closed--

00:22:08.253 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:90%
this is the important piece.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are closed, and you
have your eyes facing the sun.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And through your
closed eyelids, you

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
imagine the sun coming
into to your brain

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
stimulating the pineal gland
and going down and stimulating

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
your thyroid, your
thymus, your adrenals,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and imagining your
brain's waking up.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
A couple minutes of
that with your eyes

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
closed will start to
stimulate serotonin.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.515 align:middle line:84%
Doing that twice a day for a
week raises your serotonin.

00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just talking
about it makes me happy.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It really feels
like a soothing--

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an
ayurvedic oil meditation.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And the sun, the vitamin
D, and everything that

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:90%
brings you into that place.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: It really
stimulates the serotonin

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:90%
so that you can sleep better.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You have more melatonin so
you can sleep better at night.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
really don't have

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
the biochemistry of happiness.

That's an important thing.

But you know where I find
people get tripped up

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the most is their thoughts.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to deceive you.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
applied kinesiology.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So now three times, Lisa,
I'd like you to say,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: We know you're not.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:90%
But put your arm out.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Stay strong.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:90%
No energy there.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: You went weak.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Now three times.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good person.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm a good person.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good person.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good person.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Arm out.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Stay strong.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.585 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I want to
show you one more.

00:24:32.585 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: You're a fabulous
mother to a beautiful daughter

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Kayla, who I adore.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, she
loves you, too.

00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: And she's great.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Now as a parent, my
suspicion is, at some point,

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
you've told her, honey,
don't use the word "can't."

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I have.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was a four-letter
word in our family.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Well, this
is so cool to show kids.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Three times I want you to
say, I can't do a good job.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can't do a good job.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:90%
I can't do a good job.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't do a good job.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Arm out.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Stay strong.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ugh!

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:90%
No matter how hard I try.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Now three
times, I can do a good job.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can do a good job.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.307 align:middle line:90%
I can do a good job.

00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:90%
I can do a good job.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.307 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Put your arm out.

00:25:13.307 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Stay strong.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: If you have kids, as
I told you, show this to them.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Because they so go, oh, my gosh.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.297 align:middle line:90%
It really proves a point.

00:25:24.297 --> 00:25:25.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The power
of your thoughts.

00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Absolutely.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And 80% of our thoughts in
a given day are negative,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and we wonder why
we're so exhausted

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're constantly
pummeling ourselves.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And not giving
ourselves a fighting chance.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that
happy people have learned

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:90%
how to reverse that tendency.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I call it the Velcro
Teflon syndrome.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is our minds
are Velcro for the negative.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
We just remember that negative.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
It sticks to us.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're Teflon
for the positive.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
The positive slide off of us.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
get 10 compliments

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
in a day and one criticism,
you focus on that one negative.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just
natural to do that.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.117 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Because of
that negativity bias,

00:26:09.117 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
those 80% of our thoughts
that are negative,

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
we inherited that from
our caveman ancestors.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:90%
But happy people reverse that.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They actually Velcro
the positives,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and they Teflon the negatives.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
a couple of things

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to do to Velcro those positives
that are so crazy simple

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh, that can't
possibly do anything.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would love that.

00:26:30.633 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: But it does.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know
people like this that

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:90%
are just happy for no reason.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They're just happy.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And I wonder how?

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:84%
They have wonderful,
magical, miraculous lives.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: They have learned
to create neural pathways,

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
or they were born that way--
maybe their happiness set

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.080 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:90%
They were born that way.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But they've got neural
pathways for the positive.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we want to do.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We want to create the brain
circuitry for the positive.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Two crazy simple steps, the
first step is, look for it.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Be on the lookout.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, you're a detective.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
You are on the
lookout for the good.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the women that
I interviewed for Happy

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
for No Reason, she pretends
that she's the Academy Awards

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
committee.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And every day her job is to
give out five Academy Awards.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So she's out for a
walk in the park,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and she sees a little
cute fluffy white dog.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, that
dog gets my Academy Award

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:90%
for the cutest dog of the day.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she'll go up to the
owner and tell the owner.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Or she doesn't even
have to do that,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
but she's on the
lookout for the good.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's always
something to be grateful for.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: There is.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of
practicing looking for it.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Then the second step
is to savor the good.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Research shows that it takes
20 seconds for the good things

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to actually land and to start
creating new neural pathways

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.715 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take anywhere near
that long for the negatives

00:27:56.715 --> 00:27:57.515 align:middle line:90%
to get reinforced.

00:27:57.515 --> 00:27:58.315 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:27:58.315 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: But the
positives take 20 seconds.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So that means you've
got to actually sit

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
with that positive thing
and appreciate it rather

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.418 align:middle line:90%
than sloughing it off.

00:28:08.418 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard that
you have to have at least

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.208 align:middle line:84%
four positive
thoughts to counteract

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the damage from every
one negative thought.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: You do.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And with the positive
ones, you need

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:90%
to savor them for 20 seconds.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody gives
you a compliment,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh, you did a
great job on that project.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying,
it was nothing,

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:84%
when you knew you worked
really hard on it.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Or instead of saying,
oh, I had a lot of help,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
you actually take
in the compliment.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And you say, thank you.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I worked
really hard on that,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and I was happy with
how it turned out.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: sometimes
it's so hard to do.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I know.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not the way we were taught.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's counter-intuitive.

00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:47.748 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: It is, because
we think we're bragging.

00:28:47.748 --> 00:28:48.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:48.615 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:90%
We need to be humble.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah,
it's not bragging.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's actually just
owning what is good.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's owning what's
good in your life.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you do this?

00:28:57.995 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I try to.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not perfect.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:90%
But I do work on it, you know?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm having a
bad day, I go, OK,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
time to give out five
Academy Awards and time

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to stop and let that sunset
that's so beautiful sink in

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:90%
for 20 seconds.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that when
it sinks in for 20 seconds,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm creating new brain circuits.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point of it.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
still see yourself

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
as that depressed
little girl that's

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:90%
trying every day to be happy?

>>SHIMOFF: I really don't.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good for you.

00:29:27.415 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I really don't.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:90%
What I see is I see--

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
honestly, I feel gratitude
that that was my life journey

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
there are no accidents

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and that I had a mission, a
calling, to teach happiness.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm
on the planet for.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have been able to
be anywhere near as effective,

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, had I
just been born happy.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
like my dad and said,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to do to be happy.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You would have gotten a regular
job and moved into the world.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But this way
you're inspiring people.

00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
How much of you fulfilling
this purpose and this passion

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.115 align:middle line:84%
in your life has to do
with you being happy?

00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: You know,
I think we have

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:90%
it backwards in our society.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We think that when
we are successful

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
or when we have all the things
in line, we will be happy.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that
happiness comes first,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and then we bring that more
to our passion in life.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, happy people, that
roof that I talked about?

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:90%
That living an inspired life?

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Happy people naturally
live an inspired life.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:90%
My dad, the happy guy.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
So my dad was a dentist.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And he loved being a dentist.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:90%
He loved it.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It was his passion.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Made him happy.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: But when he retired--

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.363 align:middle line:84%
he was he was 72
when he retired.

00:30:51.363 --> 00:30:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And what happens statistically
to people when they retire,

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:90%
is they die.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.663 align:middle line:90%
They get sick or they die.

00:30:55.663 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Not because they're
suddenly older,

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
but because they've
lost their passion.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said that's
not going to happen to me.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And he analyzed what he
loved about being a dentist.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And he realized
that what he loved

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:84%
was working with his
hands in intricate ways.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And he took up his second
profession, needlepoint.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And he became a
master needlepointer.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
He won awards throughout
all Northern California.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, how great.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.395 align:middle line:10%
>>SHIMOFF: He would
go in every morning

00:31:20.395 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and sit down in my
sister's bedroom

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:10%
and put on his dental
magnifying glasses.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And that was his new
needlepoint office,

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:10%
and he would do
his needle points.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's the
idea of doing your passion.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Lisa, you are
living your passion.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And I have never seen a happy--

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:84%
really deeply
person-- happy person.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, when I say
happy for no reason,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, happy that lasts.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean an interstate of
peace and well-being that

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:90%
isn't dependent on your--

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your circumstances,
your conditions, yes.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And what I've
seen about happy people

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is that they bring their
happiness to their life

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't wait for life to
bring them their happiness.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:90%
They're happy in the moment.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they're
doing, they're happy.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.717 align:middle line:84%
But they're also, they've
found those things

00:32:09.717 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're on the planet
here to do, and they do them.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it truly
is an inside job.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not circumstantial,
or what you have,

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and how much you have.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Although, there is so
much marketing that says

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.840 align:middle line:84%
we are happier and better
people if we buy this

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and if we do this.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it all external.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: You know, if
money, success, fame,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:84%
looks were the
secret to happiness,

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
we would have a lot more happy
people in Hollywood, right?

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And we don't.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:90%
We see.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
We hear the tragic

who have all the goodies.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's a really
important message for all of us

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to get, the awareness
that it is--

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that there are some
habits that we can change

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:90%
to raise our happiness level.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:84%

the examples of what
happy for no reason is.

talking about happiness,
researching happiness.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:84%
How did you take that
into a space of miracles,

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:90%
of the miraculous in your life?

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So I found myself
waking up every morning feeling

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%
like, wow.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:90%
I am living this amazing life.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd never know what was

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.356 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you still
have dips in the way?

00:34:03.356 --> 00:34:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Only when I stopped
doing some of the practices.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
So when I stopped exercising,
I would have a dip.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:90%
I had to always remind myself.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fortunate because I
have wonderful people around me,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:90%

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:90%

this is a miraculous life.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It was as though things were

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.214 align:middle line:84%

So I was finding myself in
these last decades, last decade,

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:84%
waking up every
morning going, I can't

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:90%
believe this life I'm living.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And the outside things were
great, but it was the inside.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling deeply happy.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
happiness and love, to me,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.060 align:middle line:84%
are the two biggest energetic--
highest energetic vibrations

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of
the things I think

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that is so cool about your story

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:90%
saying, I have a charmed life.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.655 align:middle line:90%
You work at this.

00:35:34.655 --> 00:35:35.819 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I do.

00:35:35.819 --> 00:35:36.736 align:middle line:90%

>>SHIMOFF: It's a practice.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an ongoing practice.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is
when I'm feeling

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that happy for no reason, I
attract to me amazing things.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a miraculous life.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I call it living in
the miracle zone,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
where you're just in the
flow, where life is working.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Because happiness, love,
high energetic vibrations,

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.703 align:middle line:84%
they attract to
you these miracles.

00:36:04.703 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's like a formula.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.743 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It is.

00:36:06.743 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's like a formula.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.610 align:middle line:84%
If you have been a
very depressed person.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot
of circumstances

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:90%
happen in your life.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You can put this together
with these practices

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and constantly repeat them
and start to shift your life.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a formula.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.213 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I've seen
it with, at this point,

00:36:23.213 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:84%
thousands and
thousands of people.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It does not matter what
your circumstances are.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
your past has been.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can do some of
these simple practices

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and feel happier, be happier.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's like this
self-perpetuating cycle,

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:90%
where you start to just--

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.950 align:middle line:84%
you're in this
great energy spiral

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
of drawing in amazing
things happening.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I was finding myself
waking up going,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:90%
every morning is a miracle.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.655 align:middle line:90%
Miracles are happening today.

00:36:50.655 --> 00:36:51.905 align:middle line:90%
And so I created this program.

00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Simple steps, you said?

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.465 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Simple steps.

00:36:54.465 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, we like simple.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Shall we do some?

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah!

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: OK, one thing
to get you immediately

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
into the miracle zone
is to do a practice

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from the
Institute of HeartMath.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:90%
You know them well.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, they've
been on the show, yes.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: They have.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple technique called
the inner ease technique.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And it moves you from
being stressed out

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.508 align:middle line:90%
to being in the zone.

00:37:17.508 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I could use this.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And what they
call heart rhythm coherence.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
before I show it,

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say
that five minutes,

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
they found five minutes
of being angry or upset

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:84%
will weaken your immune
system for up to six hours,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
whereas five minutes
of feeling happy,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.080 align:middle line:84%
heart open, love, that will
strengthen your immune system

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:90%
for up to six hours.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going
to do about a minute,

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but it will have
a powerful effect.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be my
Guinea pig, if I you will.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm happy to be.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I want
you to tell me how

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you feel different after
you're done with this, OK?

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And I want
everybody to do this with us.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:90%
So play along.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Play along.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:90%
It's no fun to just watch us.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: OK, three steps.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's close our eyes
because it goes a little deeper

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:90%
with our eyes closed.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: All right,
so the first step

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is to simply place the palm
of your hand over your heart.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Now the simple act of putting
your hand on your heart

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
starts the flow of a
chemical called oxytocin.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
happy chemicals.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is, it's also
known as the love or bonding

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.980 align:middle line:84%
We feel more oxytocin when
we're bonded or connected

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But right now, just
your hand on your heart

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:90%
is stimulating oxytocin.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Now the second
step is to imagine

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing in
and out through the center

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine that your inhales
are coming into your heart,

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and your exhales are
going out of your heart.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You can do this
at your own pace,

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but feeling or imagining
your breath coming

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:90%
into and out of your heart.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.917 align:middle line:84%
You may already
notice that you're

00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:56.590 align:middle line:90%
starting to feel a shift.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
The final step, on each inhale,
breathe into your heart love,

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:90%
ease, and compassion.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Your exhales, you just breathe
normally out of your heart.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But on each inhale, breathe
in love, ease, and compassion.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of a time
when you felt that or imagined

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:84%
somebody that you feel that with
or you can just silently say

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.430 align:middle line:84%
the words, love,
ease, and compassion,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and it will have
the same result.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
breathing that in.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And on the exhale, you can take
your hand away and slowly open

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:90%
your eyes.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.715 align:middle line:84%
And just notice, just
notice, do you feel a shift?

00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So how do you feel
any different?

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am actually
a little giggly.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of-- so a
story, I was in LA, stuck

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:84%
in massive traffic, and
late to the airport.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Somebody came around me, and
bypassed all the traffic,

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.288 align:middle line:84%
and went into the emergency
lane, and cut in front of me.

00:39:59.288 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, I'm
over here obeying the law.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to catch a flight.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this person
totally disobeyed the law

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and cut in front of me.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was so frustrated.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I had this technique!

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Right!

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.023 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:40:14.023 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's cool
is, you don't have

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
to do it with your eyes closed.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I did not
go to calm in that moment.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, no, no.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And so
here's what I do.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I do this a couple
of times a day.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
gets you in the habit.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I've done this probably
thousands of times now.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.228 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is put
my hand up to my heart,

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and I immediately go into,
they call it the love response,

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's got its own brain
chemistry, brain wiring, heart

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:84%
rhythms, and biochemistry,
this love response.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.633 align:middle line:84%
So just practice doing it
a couple of times a day.

00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:45.050 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with
your eyes open.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I do it when I'm on the
phone with somebody.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:90%
I do it when I'm driving.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.023 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to--

00:40:50.023 --> 00:40:51.690 align:middle line:84%
you can still pay
attention to the road.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It would've been
perfect, this morning.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to have
a little more compassion,

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:84%
for I had no idea what
he was going through.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.068 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to have
that anywhere, I mean,

00:41:03.068 --> 00:41:04.610 align:middle line:84%
imagine what this
world would be like

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.650 align:middle line:90%
if we were all compassionate.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Totally, if we were
all walking around feeling

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:90%
more--

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
feeling our own
love and compassion.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Then, it changes everything.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.185 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then this
leads to the miracles.

00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:90%
What does miracle mean to you?

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:90%
What is your definition of that?

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So the
dictionary definition,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Webster's definition
of a miracle,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is a surprise and
welcome event that

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
is not explainable by
science and that can often

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%
be attributed to
grace or divine grace.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And so here's the deal.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:90%
We can't create miracles.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe that miracles
come to us from grace.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do is
we can put ourselves

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.620 align:middle line:90%
in that flow of grace.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We can put ourselves in
the flow of miracles.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a great quote
by Sri Ramakrishna,

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
who said the winds of
grace are always blowing.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.040 align:middle line:90%
We have to raise our sales.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.917 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:42:02.917 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we teach
in Your Year of Miracles,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:84%
is we teach people how to
raise their sales to be

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:90%
living in this miracle zone.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it different
than intentions?

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: It is,
to some degree.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Intention is part of it,
but it's more than that.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe what we
can look at is,

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
what are the mistakes that
people make that keep them

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.968 align:middle line:84%
from living more in
the miracle zone?

00:42:27.968 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll share
with you what you

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.115 align:middle line:90%
can do to write those mistakes.

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I'm
thinking, Marci, of times

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:middle line:90%
where I need a miracle.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like, I need a
straight-up Hail Mary.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah, and a lot
of people feel that way.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.706 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And I
understand that deeply.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
any of the things

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk about,
they put you more in that state

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:84%
where the miracle,
you'll see the miracle.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It'll show up more.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's creating
the environment for it.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So number one, one of the
biggest mistakes people make

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is they hold on.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
They hold onto the past,
and they don't let go.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't let go,
the universe cannot come

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.630 align:middle line:84%
in and give us
what it is we want.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:90%
We can't get the new.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a saying,
nature abhors a vacuum.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you're filled with old
stuff, old thoughts, old stuff

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're hanging
onto, the universe

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.960 align:middle line:84%
will not bring in
miracles for you.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.565 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to give
you a simple practice.

00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I love it.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: To get you in
the habit of letting go.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, because that
pattern of neural grooves,

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
talk about creating
patterns of negativity.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:90%
It drives deep.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It does drive deep.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was not a
good letter goer.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:90%
I was a hanger-oner.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to start you off

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.090 align:middle line:84%
on letting go of
some physical stuff

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:84%
because that helps you
let go emotionally.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:90%
It gets you trained to let go.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And the
practice that I'm

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.308 align:middle line:84%
going to share with
you is called--

00:43:57.308 --> 00:43:58.430 align:middle line:90%
is a feng shui practice.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I learned it from
a feng shui master.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Feng shui is the Chinese
art of placement and flow,

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:84%
how to create placement
in your home for flow.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply,
I call it 27 by 9.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:84%
You give away 27 items a
day for nine days in a row.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
You give away or throw away
27 items a day for nine days.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And you think, I
don't have 27 items I

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.340 align:middle line:90%
could give away or throw away.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:22.775 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:44:22.775 --> 00:44:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: You do.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:84%
You will be amazed how
many like broken pens

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.880 align:middle line:84%
you have and all
kinds of things.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And you don't skip a day because
each day it's cumulative.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Each day builds on the last day.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And miracles happen at
the end of the nine days.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:84%
People have jobs-- job
offers come to them

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.528 align:middle line:90%
that they've wanted for years.

00:44:44.528 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Create the space.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.237 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: They meet
their life partner.

00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:49.502 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's uncanny
what happens.

00:44:49.502 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's awesome.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.560 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And all of that holds energy.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us--

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It does.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And so you're saying, I'm ready.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm letting go of
that old stuff.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Releasing it.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Releasing it.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.035 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, you also start

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to release some
of the emotional baggage

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:90%
that we carry.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and
you create space.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm thinking
of 27 things

00:45:11.145 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I can let go of right now.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna get a box.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna put it all in there.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.035 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And some of it
you're going to put away,

00:45:16.035 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
you're going to donate.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It feels so extraordinary.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:84%
A number of years ago, there
was a great book called

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:90%
"The Magic Art of Tidying Up."

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was based on
that same principle.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:29.770 align:middle line:90%
But this is simple.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.615 align:middle line:84%
27 items for nine days,
and then watch your life

00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever moved
and you can't understand

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.000 align:middle line:90%
how you have so much stuff?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah, I know.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it multiplies.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, things
that we don't let

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:84%
go of that are no
longer working,

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that are broken,
that someday you'll

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.590 align:middle line:84%
fix, or stain on the
shirt, and all of that.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it creates this space.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I used to do this on my
desk and cleared the desk.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And every time I did that,
a new job would come--

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:57.635 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:45:57.635 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then, I forgot.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Something that was
rewarding and validating,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I would remember.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: It puts
you in the zone,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.820 align:middle line:90%
puts you in the miracle zone.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the miracle zone.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.188 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: That's
the miracle zone.

00:46:09.188 --> 00:46:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And here's another one.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you
some practical stuff.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You and I, we love
the practical.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We do.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: So when
people ask me,

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:84%
what's the biggest thing
that keeps people out

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of the miracle zone, I
would say the answer is,

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.220 align:middle line:90%
lack of self-love.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.560 align:middle line:84%
When we don't love
ourselves enough,

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.840 align:middle line:84%
we don't feel
worthy of miracles,

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and we push them away.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.370 align:middle line:84%
They're there, and we're
going-- subconsciously,

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.810 align:middle line:84%
we're not doing
this consciously.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.375 align:middle line:84%
But, subconsciously,
we're going, no, no, no.

00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As women,
we tend to also want

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:90%
to play small and hide.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.190 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:46.148 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But we're here.

00:46:46.148 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Exactly.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, think about ways
that you-- and unconsciously

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:84%
are pushing away good
in your life, daily.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Things like, people give you a
compliment, you push it away.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
People offer you support,
and you feel like,

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.505 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, I've got to help
them twice as much as--

00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't deserve it.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: I don't deserve it.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Or we feel like if
good comes our way,

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:84%
we feel guilty because we
feel like we should have

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.850 align:middle line:90%
had to work harder to get it.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of these
are ways that we're

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:90%
pushing away our good.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want
to do is open up

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to self-love to feel
more worthy of it.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you in a
minute what I do for that,

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
but I want to tell you a quick
story that really shifted

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:90%
things for me around this.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's around money.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of people
want to receive more money.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:90%
They want more money, right?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember years ago,
probably 20 years ago,

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I went to a workshop
with Marianne Williamson,

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.340 align:middle line:84%
who is an extraordinary--
she's now a dear friend--

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:84%
she's just an extraordinary
teacher, and woman, and person.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said that if you
start making a lot of money

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and you don't raise your
consciousness, if you don't

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.150 align:middle line:84%
have that feeling of
worthiness, if you

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.180 align:middle line:84%
don't raise your consciousness,
you will inevitably lose it.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And I remember thinking, no way.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.960 align:middle line:90%
That will never happen to me.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:84%
If I started making a lot
of money, I won't lose that.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure enough,
a year later, I

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:84%
started making a
lot of money, way

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.582 align:middle line:84%
more than what my
consciousness felt worthy of.

00:48:23.582 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your set point.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Exactly.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I hit my upper
limit, my set point,

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and I started losing money.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I was losing
it in all kinds of ways.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, I remembered
what Marianne had said.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started working
on that consciousness,

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.580 align:middle line:84%
on that self-love that felt
worthy of receiving it.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I turned it around.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I say to
people, when you're

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:50.210 align:middle line:84%
saying, I want more
of this or that, ask,

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.970 align:middle line:90%
do I have that worthiness?

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.725 align:middle line:84%
Do I have that deep
feeling of self-love?

00:48:53.725 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes
so much sense.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Because people see you the
way that you see yourself.

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're
showing up in a room

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.623 align:middle line:84%
playing small, and
not feeling worthy,

00:49:01.623 --> 00:49:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and not having a
lot of self-love,

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that's how you
will be perceived.

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder, well,
they don't see my value.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.728 align:middle line:84%
But if you turn that around
and have the practice first--

00:49:10.728 --> 00:49:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right--

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --raising
your consciousness,

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.690 align:middle line:90%
raising the self--

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And I
think the universe,

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.810 align:middle line:84%
it said that people
won't give to you more

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.130 align:middle line:90%
than what you feel worthy of.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe the universe
is the same way.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The universe will
not give to you

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:90%
beyond what you feel worthy of.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.295 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to
develop some self-love.

00:49:26.295 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do that?

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's that
responsibility thing, too.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah, that's right.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Taking responsibility
for feeling worthy,

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.240 align:middle line:90%
loved, compassionate.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.222 align:middle line:90%
Showing up that way,

00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah, and then
watch what the energy does.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: OK, So simple
practice, and it's--

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.100 align:middle line:84%
when we love something,
we take care of it, right?

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: You know, you
take care of things--

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:84%
but what we don't do is we
don't take care of ourselves.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We're sending a message that
we're not worthy of that.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you
to do is ask yourself

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.273 align:middle line:84%
this question a couple of
times a day, a simple question,

00:49:57.273 --> 00:49:58.690 align:middle line:84%
even write it on
a little Post-It.

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Question is, what's
the most loving thing I

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.700 align:middle line:90%
could do for myself right now?

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What's the most loving thing I
could do for myself right now?

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you stop,
and you do it.

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It could be, I could
take some water.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It could be, I
could call a friend.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be, I could do
that inner ease technique.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what the answer is.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.800 align:middle line:84%
What matters is your
training yourself

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.955 align:middle line:90%
to take care of yourself.

00:50:22.955 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And it shows yourself that
you're being more self-loving.

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It sends the
message to yourself.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.222 align:middle line:90%
And it's small things.

00:50:29.222 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do anything huge.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: No, you're not going
to go out and save the world.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, you're just doing
small things to give, give,

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:90%
give back to yourself.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it tells the
brain, the psyche.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm worth that.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking care of.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the most primal
human needs is to feel safe

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and to feel loved.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.183 align:middle line:84%
Those two things
go hand in hand.

00:50:52.183 --> 00:50:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you do little
micro things like that,

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.195 align:middle line:90%
it makes a lot of sense.

00:50:55.195 --> 00:50:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It does.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.283 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: You know,
I want to go back

00:50:59.283 --> 00:51:01.375 align:middle line:84%
to our conversation
about what is a miracle.

00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:02.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:02.175 --> 00:51:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Because
miracles can be anything.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It could be, you pick up
a book, and it has in it

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:84%
exactly what it was you
needed to hear right then.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: It could be the
person calls you on the phone

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that has your answer or
that you needed to talk to--

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.280 align:middle line:84%
small miracles all day long,
just that feeling-- the parking

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.630 align:middle line:90%
place shows up.

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicity.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Then, there are big miracles.

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.520 align:middle line:90%
The big miracles.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Finding your soul mate.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We had so many
people that I know

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have trained
these things, to move

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.487 align:middle line:84%
into the miracle zone,
they've learned these things.

00:51:39.487 --> 00:51:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And they've been trying
to get pregnant for years,

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and they suddenly get pregnant.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Or their
ideal job shows up,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.920 align:middle line:84%
or money comes in the mail
that they weren't expecting.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They needed that $3,000
to pay off something,

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and it just showed up
exactly when they needed it.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:57.207 align:middle line:90%
There's even a story that--

00:51:57.207 --> 00:51:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean, do you
have to graduate into this?

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.925 align:middle line:84%
Like, miracles are accessible
to everyone, right?

00:52:01.925 --> 00:52:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: They are.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.030 align:middle line:90%
They're accessible to everybody.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.790 align:middle line:90%
They're around us all day long.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to put
ourselves in that space.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
extreme stories, like,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.770 align:middle line:90%
the Marcel Sternberger story.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, Marcel.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.357 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
actually take a look

00:52:18.357 --> 00:52:20.150 align:middle line:84%
at this wonderful
video of her talking

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.885 align:middle line:84%
about a miracle
in someone's life.

00:52:21.885 --> 00:52:22.685 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:52:22.685 --> 00:52:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Hi,
I'm Marci Shimoff.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to our
happiness community.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.100 align:middle line:10%
I want to talk with you today
about a really cool subject--

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.750 align:middle line:10%
miracles.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.763 align:middle line:10%
Now some of you know
that I have gotten

00:52:34.763 --> 00:52:36.680 align:middle line:10%
to co-author a number
of books in the "Chicken

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Soup for the Soul"
series, and I've

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.465 align:middle line:10%
been very fortunate to read
over 20,000 stories that

00:52:41.465 --> 00:52:43.340 align:middle line:10%
have been submitted to
the Chicken Soup books

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:10%
over the years.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And I have read so many stories
about incredible, incredible

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:10%
miracles.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.660 align:middle line:10%
So let me share with you
today one of my favorites.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.770 align:middle line:10%
It's really quite amazing.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:10%
It's a story about a man
named Marcel Sternberger.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:10%
And Marcel was
living in New York.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:10%
And he boarded everyday the
same subway, his 909 subway

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.760 align:middle line:10%
into work.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.890 align:middle line:10%
And this one day, he ended
up taking a different subway.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:14.210 align:middle line:10%
And he gets on,
and there he sees--

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:18.920 align:middle line:10%
he sits down next to a man who's
reading a Hungarian newspaper.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.980 align:middle line:10%
And Marcel was from Hungary.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.420 align:middle line:10%
And so he looked at the man and
he said, where are you from?

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.710 align:middle line:10%
And what brought you here?

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And the man said,
well, I was in Hungary,

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and I had, really, to
escape the country.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.920 align:middle line:10%
And it was very sad.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.220 align:middle line:10%
I left my wife and the
rest of my family behind.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.020 align:middle line:10%
And they were all killed.

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.900 align:middle line:10%
I went back to our village,
and really nobody was left,

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.590 align:middle line:10%
and I came to America
about a year ago.

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:52.020 align:middle line:10%
And at hearing this,
Marcel thought, wow,

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.780 align:middle line:10%
this sounds really familiar.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.840 align:middle line:10%
About a week ago, he had been
at a party of some friends.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.030 align:middle line:10%
And he had heard a
very similar story

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:10%
with the same village
even involved.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:05.270 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at the man and
he said, what's your name?

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And the man said, well,
my name's Bela Paskin.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.830 align:middle line:10%
And the man said, what
was your wife's name?

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.510 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
my wife, she's dead.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:10%
But it was Maria.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.123 align:middle line:10%
And Marcel took the man by
his hand and said, come on,

00:54:21.123 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:10%
we have to get off
the train right away.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:24.150 align:middle line:10%
I have to make a phone call.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And they get off the
train, and he calls up

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.390 align:middle line:10%
this phone number of this
woman he had met at a party

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:30.880 align:middle line:10%
the prior week.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.630 align:middle line:10%
He gets on the phone
with her and he says,

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.980 align:middle line:10%
what was your husband's name?

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And she said, well,
my husband, he's dead,

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.280 align:middle line:10%
but his name was Bela Paskin.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:46.870 align:middle line:10%
Marcel hands the phone to Bela
and said, this is a miracle.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.090 align:middle line:10%
This is your wife
on the other line.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:10%
Please tell her hello.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.510 align:middle line:10%
It happened on a
Brooklyn subway.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:57.670 align:middle line:10%
I've told this story
many times and I still

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.280 align:middle line:10%
get goose bumps telling it.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.960 align:middle line:10%
Miracles can happen in our
life when we are open to them.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And you know, most
of us don't have

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.940 align:middle line:10%
miracles like that
happening regularly,

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.360 align:middle line:10%
but we have simple,
everyday miracles happening.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.500 align:middle line:10%
So what I invite you
to do in your own life,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.800 align:middle line:10%
right now, today, and
over the next week or so,

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.350 align:middle line:10%
notice the miracles that
are happening in your life.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Notice the little ones and give
gratitude for the little ones.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.430 align:middle line:10%
Because when you do give
gratitude for those,

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.650 align:middle line:10%
then the big ones
begin to show up.

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That story about
Marcel is incredible.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he was
just able to create that

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:90%
without ever even expecting it--

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.620 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is,
anyone can do this.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It's micro-miracles when
you start to look for them,

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you kind of evolve
into these major miracles.

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's this
principle that what

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:84%
you put your attention on
grows stronger in your life.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
your attention on,

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:04.960 align:middle line:84%
what are the
miracles showing up,

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.675 align:middle line:90%
you start to get more of them.

00:56:06.675 --> 00:56:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
thing for everybody

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to start to do, just
throughout your day, notice

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.160 align:middle line:90%
what are the miracles.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Same thing we talked about with
happiness looking for the good.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.493 align:middle line:84%
Really register, wow, that was
miraculous what happened today.

00:56:18.493 --> 00:56:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is great awareness.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.202 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you
talked about mistakes

00:56:21.202 --> 00:56:24.940 align:middle line:84%
people make to prevent
themselves and letting go,

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:25.870 align:middle line:90%
which we talked about.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah, not letting go.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.730 align:middle line:90%
They hang on too long.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.860 align:middle line:84%
We talked about, they don't
have enough self-love.

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:90%
So two more mistakes.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.780 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, they
picture the wrong things.

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They use the power
of their minds

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to visualize exactly what they
don't want to have happen.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's called worry.

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Another default.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.405 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Any time that
we're stuck in worry,

00:56:46.405 --> 00:56:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're visualizing
the worst-case scenario,

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.298 align:middle line:90%
the power of our vision is huge.

00:56:53.298 --> 00:56:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that people
who live in the miracles zone

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.440 align:middle line:84%
use that extraordinary
power of our minds

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to visualize to the positive.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They visualize what
it is they want

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to have happen during the day.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.930 align:middle line:84%
They visualize the
miracles happening.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:09.520 align:middle line:90%
They use that power in that way.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.492 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've used
this a lot in your life.

00:57:11.492 --> 00:57:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Can I do another little
demonstration with you?

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to share
a quick story, though.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.200 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the ways that--

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.820 align:middle line:84%
my father has been
very, very sick.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that we just

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.860 align:middle line:84%
kept saying six weeks, seven
weeks in the hospital, we

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:84%
kept saying, you're going to
be at my house for Christmas.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be at
my house for Christmas.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple
weeks, he's gonna

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.080 align:middle line:90%
be in my house for Christmas.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.915 align:middle line:90%
That was the best gift ever.

00:57:35.915 --> 00:57:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: What you did in
saying that was you actually

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.310 align:middle line:84%
created a visual
with him being there,

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.720 align:middle line:84%
around the table with
everybody at the tree.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.800 align:middle line:84%
They created a very
powerful visual image,

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and visual images make
a huge difference.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's do this little
demonstration, OK?

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's take your right arm
and put it straight ahead.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.592 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to do is twist around

00:58:01.592 --> 00:58:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in the direction of your arm.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to twist
as far as you can

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:06.520 align:middle line:84%
without moving the
rest of your body

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and see where your
finger lands, OK?

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Twist around.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And memorize the spot
where your finger lands,

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and come on back to the front.

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I hope everybody's doing
this along with us.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do it at home.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:16.660 align:middle line:90%

>>SHIMOFF: Play along.

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:21.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, what I want
you to do, 20 seconds,

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.163 align:middle line:84%
we'll just close our
eyes, don't move anything.

00:58:24.163 --> 00:58:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to picture
yourself twisting around

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.582 align:middle line:90%
the same way you just did.

00:58:27.582 --> 00:58:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But this time, I want
you to see yourself

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:31.720 align:middle line:84%
easily and effortlessly
twisting so

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that your finger lands
four or five inches farther

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.740 align:middle line:90%
along the wall.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.820 align:middle line:84%
See where that would be, get a
picture of where that would be,

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and just see yourself
twisting around

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.550 align:middle line:84%
so that your finger lands
four to five inches farther.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Now open up your eyes, point
your finger straight ahead,

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.338 align:middle line:84%
twist around in
that same direction,

00:58:52.338 --> 00:58:53.380 align:middle line:90%
and see where you landed.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:58:54.465 --> 00:58:55.265 align:middle line:90%

brain until the day you die.

all of these habits.

go through all of these

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.130 align:middle line:84%
your space, and finding
self-love, and doing

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the visualization, the
people in your life

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.620 align:middle line:84%
are going to maybe
start to change.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: That's
actually accurate.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.490 align:middle line:90%
They do start to change.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Because like energy tends
to hang out together.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that we become
the average of the five people

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.178 align:middle line:90%
we spend the most time with.

01:00:18.178 --> 01:00:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people, make a
little list of your five

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and see if you want
to catch their energy.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a phenomenon
called emotional contagion.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And it says that we
catch the emotions

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
of the people around us, just
like we catch their colds.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you're around people
who are a bummer to be around,

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:38.010 align:middle line:90%
you're catching that.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%
We're all energetic beings.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.313 align:middle line:90%
You walk into a room.

01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
There's been an argument in
the room, the argument's over.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
tension in the air.

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.842 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
you're a psychic.

01:00:48.842 --> 01:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It's that there were chemicals
released into the atmosphere

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
that people pick up on.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You're picking up
on the chemicals.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.897 align:middle line:84%
That's happening all day long
with everybody around you.

01:00:57.897 --> 01:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I found is that people
who want to live in the miracle

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
zone, they consciously
surround themselves

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.897 align:middle line:84%
with a dream team, a
miracles dream team.

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And you're on my miracles dream.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and
you're on mine, too.

01:01:10.813 --> 01:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, together, so
your year of miracles

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
is a yearlong mentoring
program that you

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.718 align:middle line:90%
co-created five years ago.

01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about that
and then the mentoring groups

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:19.710 align:middle line:90%
within it.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah,
so what I found is

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that becoming happier, raising
your happiness set point

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.390 align:middle line:90%
is a formula.

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I found that living
in the miracle zone

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
is also a formula
that can be taught.

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we did this experiment
where we gathered people from--

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
actually, 72 countries
have joined for a year.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.790 align:middle line:90%
This was five years ago.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We started with
about 1800 women.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
each month sharing

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.337 align:middle line:84%
with people, with
them, how to raise--

01:01:51.337 --> 01:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
how to live more in
the miracle zone--

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in health, in
relationships, in money,

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:56.940 align:middle line:90%
in every area of their life.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And created a community.

01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: We
created a community.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have miracle
groups, that they

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
have a small group of
six to seven people,

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
where they support each
other's miracles happening.

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do it on your own.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
miracle after miracle.

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of my miracles this
year is that you're joining me.

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I am so grateful.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Next program.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.768 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I love the groups.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you have people
you've never met before--

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --from all these
different walks of life,

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.993 align:middle line:84%
and you're celebrating
each other's miracles.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: And
you're intentioning

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
for these each other's
miracles, which super-charges

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.810 align:middle line:90%
everybody's intention.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, the
research from Lynne McTaggart,

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
our dear friend
and colleague, who

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
has shown that the power
of other people putting

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
their attention on your
intention is phenomenal.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Focused intention.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
When you have eight or less
people focusing their energy,

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
as you said, the chemical--

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
even if it's virtual, if it's
on the phone, it doesn't matter.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: That's right.

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.720 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's non-local.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can get that
intention poured-- and love--

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
poured into the other person's
greatest, greatest good.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yes.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's incredible
how these miracles show up

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
in people's lives.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
is truly beautiful.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I pinch myself when
I just hear all these story

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
after story after story.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what I believe--
and I think you probably are

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.280 align:middle line:90%
with me on this--

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
this is the time.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time on the planet
that we are needing this.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.510 align:middle line:90%
This is our time.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
not an accident.

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is listening
to this right

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
now, who's joining us right now,
their soul called them to this.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
There's something about this
conversation that their soul is

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.100 align:middle line:90%
saying, yes, that's--

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of this.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because trust me, there
is so much on the airwaves,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, that is
not this conversation.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is a ray of light.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a tool that
we need more than anything

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
right now, especially
with the negative news

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and the divisiveness.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.145 align:middle line:84%
It has to happen like this and
that these little groups are

01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:08.923 align:middle line:84%
the little nucleuses around
the world that are creating

01:04:08.923 --> 01:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
miracles from all different
countries, all different walks

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
of life.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.125 align:middle line:84%
It's really a beautifully
orchestrated, well thought-out

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:15.925 align:middle line:90%
program.

01:04:15.925 --> 01:04:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Thank you.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It really is.

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: It works.

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:19.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm into results.

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.740 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, this
is what I believe

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.590 align:middle line:90%
our planet needs these days.

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you said,
create the conditions

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
for miracles in your life.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not saying,
there's water into wine.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.415 align:middle line:90%
You're not saying that.

01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
magic wand here.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: No.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.647 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These are the
conditions, right?

01:04:39.647 --> 01:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Yes, and as I
say, if people would devote,

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say, 5 to 10 minutes
a day to creating these

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
conditions, to doing these
simple practices that we

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:51.130 align:middle line:90%
share--

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:53.745 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
don't even take extra time.

01:04:53.745 --> 01:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
As you're going
through your day,

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.020 align:middle line:90%
you're looking for the good.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.437 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
the miraculous.

01:04:57.437 --> 01:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
You're taking a minute and just
doing a little bit of this.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
If people would do that,
they would see such shifts

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.332 align:middle line:84%
in their life in such a
short time period that--

01:05:06.332 --> 01:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I met some of
these wonderful people,

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and they have created
new businesses.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
They've created
coaching-- certifications.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've gotten
whole new lines of work--

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
health, incredible--
relationships.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: Relationships,
where they hadn't talked

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:26.030 align:middle line:90%
to a brother, or a mother--

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or a child.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Or a child for years.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And something melted.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I met one
of those women.

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Yeah.

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She just sat there
after days in the whole year

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.680 align:middle line:90%
of the program.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
month of the program,

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
just sat sobbing because
she had not connected

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.320 align:middle line:90%
with her daughter for years.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And she realized
it was her piece.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
She realized her
piece in all of it.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And it shifted at
that moment, which

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
then will shift her
daughter, and her daughter's

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:00.820 align:middle line:90%
children, and their children.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.855 align:middle line:84%
And she could break the
cycle of estrangement.

01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:06.460 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it's so incredible.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes
is just a minute.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It just takes a minute.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:10.750 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I ask all of my guests,
because I really want to know

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'm curious.

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest
reason, Marcy?

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest
why, why you do all this?

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: I love
that question, Lisa.

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.410 align:middle line:10%
I really love that question.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:25.870 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I do
this, the reason I'm

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:28.660 align:middle line:10%
so passionate about
people being happier

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.670 align:middle line:10%
and people living
in the miracle zone

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:33.700 align:middle line:10%
is that I believe it's
why we're on the planet.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I believe-- people often
say is it selfish, Marci,

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.290 align:middle line:90%
to want to be happier?

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%
What about the world?

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
What about the world?

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, the suffering.

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.612 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: The suffering.

01:06:41.612 --> 01:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I can say
is, I absolutely

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
believe that it's the least
selfish thing that we can do.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.610 align:middle line:10%
Because when we
are happier, when

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.250 align:middle line:10%
we're living in
the miracle zone,

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.810 align:middle line:10%
we are having this huge
impact on this planet of ours.

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.970 align:middle line:10%
And there's a Chinese proverb,
you've been to my living room.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
It hangs on-- a wall hanging in
my living room, and I love it.

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:00.810 align:middle line:90%
It sums up why I do this.

01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It says, when there
is light in the soul,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
there will be beauty
in the person.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
When there is beauty
in the person,

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
there will be
harmony in the house.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
When there is
harmony in the house,

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.420 align:middle line:84%
there will be order
in the nation.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And when there is
order in the nation,

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:17.345 align:middle line:84%
there will be peace
in this world.

01:07:17.345 --> 01:07:19.345 align:middle line:84%
And that is my prayer and
my wish for everyone--

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:20.303 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's beautiful.

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHIMOFF: --that We all
know that light in our souls,

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.430 align:middle line:90%
that we live that.

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And through that, we create
a planet here of peace.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, you're
living it, girl.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being
with me and for showing us

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
what it really, truly means
to live in the miracle zone.

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHIMOFF: Thank you, Lisa.

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.245 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

01:07:38.245 --> 01:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
doing these exercises with us.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Please continue to practice
this on a daily basis

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.928 align:middle line:90%
multiple times a day.

01:07:46.928 --> 01:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for joining me.
