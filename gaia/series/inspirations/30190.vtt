00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.154 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:10%
Have you had a hard time
finding a job lately?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:10%
Or have you maybe made a
mistake with an investment

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.434 align:middle line:10%
or lost money lately?

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
Do you have issues
around money that you

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
would like the
opportunity to clear?

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what we're talking
about today, "The Law of Divine

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:10%
Compensation," and joining me
to facilitate this conversation

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:10%
is the wonderful spiritual
author, Marianne Williamson.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:10%
It's such an honor.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.161 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why do we
have issues around money?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.834 align:middle line:84%
Is it a social conversation,
a societal conversation?

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, obviously,
our material survival

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:10%
is important.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:10%
We need a home to live in.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:10%
We need to put money--
put food on the table,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:10%
not only for ourselves
but for children.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:10%
So we don't have to
apologize for the fact

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:10%
that it's a topic that
everybody living in this world

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:10%
has to deal with.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But is it something
that we identify ourselves with?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, do we identify our
self-worth and how much

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.255 align:middle line:10%
is that attached to our income?

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, I
think that certainly we

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:10%
have financialized almost
everything in our society

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:10%
in the last few decades.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:10%
I think there is a conversation
around prestige around money

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.277 align:middle line:10%
that is perhaps inappropriate.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't mean that
the larger conversation

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
is inappropriate.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:10%
We all have to make a living.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:10%
I also think for
men, when it comes

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:10%
to losing a job,
losing all their money,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:10%
which you really
see in a recession

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.834 align:middle line:10%
or a slow economic
recovery like now,

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:10%
I think that there's
actually more

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:10%
of a psychic crisis for men
than there is for women.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think women need to
probably appreciate that more.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.289 align:middle line:84%
A lot of self-worth
based on production.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And that's
a very serious topic.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not nothing.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, no.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.768 align:middle line:10%
I'm really glad
you mentioned that,

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:10%
because men have a certain
identity that women don't

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:10%
usually have that are
gaining more and more,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:10%
but in a healthier
way, hopefully,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:10%
which is why you have
a book like this.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:10%
I have to ask you though about
the economic conversation.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And in the last decade, it
has been so intensified,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.985 align:middle line:10%
even in the last couple of
years about the 99% and the 1%.

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much
focus on this conversation.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.401 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, it's an
appropriate focus actually.

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
What was really not very
healthy in the society

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
was that we were not
talking about it.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:10%
Because for several decades we
have been through tax policies

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:10%
and through subsidies,
particularly

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.232 align:middle line:10%
to large corporations,
we have followed

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:10%
a line of development that's
been going on for quite awhile

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:10%
now in which vast amounts
of material resource

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:10%
of the country has been siphoned
into the hands of a relatively

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:10%
very few.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And this has not only
created a crisis because

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:10%
of the huge economic disparity
between that 1% and everyone

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:10%
else, but it's also a
threat to democracy itself.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:10%
You know, the late Supreme
Court Justice, Louis Brandeis,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:10%
said you can either have large
amounts of money concentrated

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:10%
in the hands of the very few,
or you can have democracy.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:10%
You cannot have both.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:10%
And there was something else
that went along with this.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Not only was it an
economic theory,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
the whole idea that if you gave
more money, if you allowed more

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:10%
money through reduced taxation
and so forth in the hands

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:10%
of a very few, they would be
the so-called job creators.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, first of all,
this-- there's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:10%
no evidence that this
is actually ever worked.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.395 align:middle line:10%
But ideologically,
some of the people,

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:10%
particularly like
during the Reagan era

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:10%
who instigated that
kind of policy,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:10%
certainly were righteous people
who thought it was a good way

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:10%
to stimulate the economy.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:10%
There were a lot
of not particularly

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:10%
intended consequences to that.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:10%
But actually, even before that
there was an economist named,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:10%
Milton Friedman, and what
began to happen in the 1970s

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:10%
is that we began--
companies began

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:10%
to shift their sense of what
their responsibility was

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:10%
towards its workers
and their community.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:10%
And this issue of what's
called shareholder value

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:10%
became in vogue.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Now what that means
has very interesting

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:10%
psychological and
philosophical implications,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:10%
because what they basically
said was that instead

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:10%
of a company making
its business,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.869 align:middle line:10%
let's say that it make the
best computer in the world.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:10%
And then, what it would
be about with its workers

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:10%
is we're going to make the
best-- I don't know if it was

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.624 align:middle line:10%
at that time a computer, because
computers were just starting--

00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:10%
but we're going to make the
best machine in the world.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And then you had this
relationship with your workers.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You working together to
make the best machine.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:90%
A team.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: You
had a relationship

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with your clients
that best-- OK.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:10%
When this shareholder
value became in vogue,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:10%
this was the idea
that no, no, no,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:10%
the most important thing is not
that you make the best machine.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:10%
The most important
thing is that you

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:10%
make money for the
shareholders in the company.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.942 align:middle line:10%
Now the idea, you could
see the value of it.

00:04:54.942 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the company
makes a machine and goes,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:10%
well, if our bottom
line is to make money

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.279 align:middle line:10%
for the shareholders,
then we're not only

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:10%
thinking about making the best
machine, we're thinking, well,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:10%
maybe we'll also
manufacture the widget

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:10%
that will go with the machine.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
However, look from a
philosophical and spiritual

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:90%
basis what this did.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It threw the
universe off in terms

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship between
the company and its workers.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Because instead of saying
we're working together

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:10%
to make the best
machine, we're saying

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:10%
we need your wages to
go down, because we

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.277 align:middle line:10%
need to create more money
for the shareholders.

00:05:27.277 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Or you'll lose your job.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.235 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes, well, that's
when it's taken to the extreme,

00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:10%
absolutely.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:10%
So it threw off the
relationship, the righteous.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.672 align:middle line:10%
It threw off the universe
between the company

00:05:36.672 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:10%
and its workers, between
the company and its clients.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:10%
And when taken to the
extreme, of course,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:10%
between the company
and the Earth,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.006 align:middle line:10%
because anything that
has to be hurt in order

00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:10%
to increase that bottom
line to shareholders,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:10%
and that began about the 1970s.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:10%
And it is thrown off
the moral universe.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to the
spiritual conversation,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:10%
that ethical center,
that issue that all

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:10%
is to be right
with the universe,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:10%
that we are righteous,
right use of the mind.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Not only with a divine
creator, some higher

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
power with the universe
itself, with each other,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with our own hearts, and
our sense of integrity,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
and with the Earth itself.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:10%
You mess with that and
nothing is ultimately

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.434 align:middle line:10%
going to work
either in the house

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:10%
in the life of the
individual or in the larger

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.270 align:middle line:10%
economic picture for anybody.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.353 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It throws a cog
in the whole entire wheel.

00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it made money more
important than people,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
more important than
life, more important--

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is what
we're feeling now.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: We're
experiencing it big time now.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Losing jobs,
being laid off,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:10%
taking hits and cuts in pay
so that we could have jobs.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And so, say you are one of those
people, and you're watching,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:10%
and you've been applying
for a job for two,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:10%
three years and not
able to find anything.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:10%
So what can we
shift in ourselves

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:10%
to turn that
conversation around?

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.314 align:middle line:10%
We know it's happening
in the exterior,

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:10%
and so that we don't
become victims to that.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.197 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: OK, well, first of
all it's not quite so separate,

00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:58.696 align:middle line:10%
because then I think
a lot of people

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:10%
in the new thought,
new spirituality,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.054 align:middle line:10%
thinks that, well, what about
only in my individual life?

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:10%
I think people are
waking up to the fact

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:10%
that we do not
live in isolation.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And I think that the economic
crisis that has hit our society

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:10%
has certainly made
that clear to people.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.787 align:middle line:10%
It's not just about you.

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:10%
It's about the collective.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the forces,
social and economic,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:10%
that affect the whole society
come home and hit you.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:10%
So that alone should
awaken all of us

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.411 align:middle line:10%
from this sort of personally
isolationist stupor.

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, I don't have anything
to do with politics.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't have anything
to do with that stuff.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to live my life.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.064 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you, it's
going to come home to you.

00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Like the French say, if
you don't do politics,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
politics will do you.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So what this book is about
is about the personal,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
which is called
the microeconomic.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:10%
It's about the personal
relationship to money

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and what you were saying,
what does one individual do?

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what, not only
the "Course of Miracles,"

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:10%
but any metaphysical treatise
or teaching basically says.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:10%
It is a self-organizing
universe,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:10%
and these are the two
principles that guide this book.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:10%
It is a self-organizing
universe,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:10%
and it is a
self-correcting universe.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, number one,
self-organizing, the embryo

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.279 align:middle line:10%
knows how to turn into a baby.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: True.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: The acorn knows
how to turn into an oak tree.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:10%
The bud knows how to
turn into a blossom.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Within
nature, it is obvious

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:10%
that there is a natural
intelligence at work.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.889 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A self-organizing--

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:90%
The cells know how to divide.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's not like-- We
seem to act, at least,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.554 align:middle line:10%
or we certainly seem to think
that all these little cells

00:08:28.554 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:10%
came together and
knew how to form

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:10%
a brain, and eyes, and skin,
and all this amazing stuff

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:10%
of your body, but then we live
as though then you were born

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:10%
and you're on your own.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:10%
But the spiritual
perspective is that not only

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.480 align:middle line:10%
was that little egg
and sperm programmed

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.267 align:middle line:10%
to become your physical body,
but that throughout all units

00:08:46.267 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:10%
of time and space, even
after you were born,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:10%
even right this moment,
the universe is similarly

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:10%
programmed to lift
you to the highest

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:10%
level of creative manifestation.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:10%
You're programmed so
that your heart beats.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:10%
You're programmed so
that your lungs breathe,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:10%
your liver works.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:10%
You're programmed
that your brain--

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:10%
so the entire universe
in which you dwell

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:10%
is similarly programmed.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, when it comes
to money and work,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:10%
no more no less
than anything else,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:10%
the universe is simply
programmed to thrive.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Now not only--

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.159 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, look at it.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we tend to
look at the world,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.801 align:middle line:10%
and we go, well, everything that
could go wrong could go wrong.

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, there's poverty.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:10%
There's starvation.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.185 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But that's
because of a lack of love,

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:90%
so let's talk about that.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:10%
If-- from the ego's
thought system,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:10%
everything that can
go wrong goes wrong,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.314 align:middle line:10%
but from a spiritual
perspective,

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual universe,
everything that can go right

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.335 align:middle line:10%
goes right.

00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Now when you talk about poverty
and so forth, some people

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:10%
might listen to what
I'm saying and go, what?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:10%
You're saying that
somebody who's

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:10%
starving in Africa, the only
reason they don't have money

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:10%
is because they
don't love enough?

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying that people
who are starving in Africa

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.310 align:middle line:10%
are starving because
we don't love enough.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:10%
There are one billion
people on this planet.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.914 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Collectively we don't?

00:09:59.914 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
let's talk about it.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:10%
We have one billion
people on this planet who

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:10%
live in what's
called deep poverty.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's $1.25 and less a day.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, we spend $700 billion
on military expenditures

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in this country
alone every year.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:10%
Columbia University
economist, Jeffrey Sachs,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:10%
has estimated for $100
billion, $100 billion,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:10%
which is one-seventh of
our military expenditure

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:10%
every year, we could
in association,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:10%
hopefully, with other
advanced nations

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:10%
of the world, the advanced
industrialized nations,

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:10%
we could within a
period of 10 years

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:10%
eradicate deep poverty
from this planet.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:10%
17,000 children starve
on this Earth every day.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:10%
They starve, Lisa.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
They starve every single day.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.736 align:middle line:84%
Not every year,
every single day.

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Now if the advanced nations
of the world-- and this

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
is why I feel so strongly about
women owning our voices-- if we

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
said, no, that ends now, and
we simply collectively decided.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But this is what happens
when you have a society,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
or civilization in this case,
where economic values rather

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
than humanitarian
values run the show.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.444 align:middle line:10%
If you made money the bottom
line rather than people

00:11:06.444 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:10%
the bottom line.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: See, what you're
saying is what I feel sometimes

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.795 align:middle line:10%
when I donate to
an organization,

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:10%
and I think in the
back of my head,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.688 align:middle line:10%
is that going to
make a difference?

00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:10%
When $700 billion is being
spent per year on other things,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:10%
is my $20 donation going
to make a difference?

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
do you know the story

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:10%
about the little boy
with the starfish?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Tell me.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.903 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: The story
goes that the little boy's

00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:10%
on the beach, and there
are all these starfish.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And he takes one starfish,
and he throws it back

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:10%
into the ocean.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:10%
And somebody says to him,
honey, what difference

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:10%
is it going to make to
all those other starfish.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:10%
There's so many starfish,
you can't possibly

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:10%
throw all of them back.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.954 align:middle line:10%
He said, well, I
helped that one.

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:10%
For that one it
made a difference.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go back
a little if I may,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.229 align:middle line:84%
because you were asking about
the one person who said,

00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have a job.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I have bills on my table,
foreclosure, whatever.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:10%
The universe is not only
in all of our lives.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:10%
This is completely
impersonal, no more or less

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:10%
you or me, no more or less
money or anything else.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:10%
Not only is the
universe set up to lift

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:10%
all things, the
spiritual universe,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:10%
to lift all things
to their highest,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:10%
the universe is not only
self-organizing in that way,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:10%
the universe is also
self-correcting.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:10%
So let's say my body.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Our bodies are set to
be healthy and to work.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.405 align:middle line:84%
If you cut your finger, the body
is also programmed to heal it.

00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To repair it.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.779 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So, the
universe is like a GPS.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
If something goes wrong--

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a good
way of looking at it.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: There
was a mistake made.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.743 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was you who
made the mistake,

00:12:30.743 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
and you made a bad investment.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was our politicians
who made a mistake,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.759 align:middle line:10%
or big corporations, somebody
did something loveless.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Because the "Course
in Miracles" says

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:10%
miracles occur naturally
as expressions of love.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:10%
When they do not occur,
something has gone wrong.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:10%
Somebody thought and
did something loveless

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:10%
that threw the universe.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It threw the miraculous
universe out of whack for you,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
but the universe
is self-correcting.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like a GPS.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:10%
You took the wrong
turn, and so the GPS

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:10%
recalibrates and immediately
creates a new route.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:10%
That's how the universe is.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:10%
In other words, if
you are bankrupt,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:10%
if you made a bad
investment, if you

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:10%
don't have any money, if you
don't have any-- have bills

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:10%
to pay or don't
have a job, the idea

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:10%
is that in enlightenment--
the "Course in Miracles"

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:10%
says you think you
have many problems.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:10%
You really only have one.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:10%
And that is your
separation from God.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
God meaning love consciousness.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if I identify
with only my mortal being,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
then I'm identifying
with a world of scarcity.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
There are only so many
pieces of the pie.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.114 align:middle line:84%
And then my mind
goes, I'm a failure.

00:13:37.114 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:90%
My parents were right.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll never amount to anything.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:10%
They're not hiring.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:10%
Even if they're hiring, they're
not hiring someone my age.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's this horrible
downward spiral.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Correct, yeah.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.176 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: If you identify
with the spiritual universe,

00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:10%
you realize, wait,
I dwell, and you

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:10%
are at the effect of the
laws that rule the world

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.399 align:middle line:10%
you identify with.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:10%
If you only identify
with the mortal,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:10%
you're at the effect of
the laws of scarcity.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
If you identify
with the spirit, you

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
realize there's an infinite
number of possibilities

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
in any given instant,
and that the universe

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:90%
has more than enough.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:10%
The universe has
already reprogrammed

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:10%
the universal computer, so that
even if something has happened

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:10%
in your life, it can
actually be transformed

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.239 align:middle line:10%
into something better than ever.

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And so it's always about
where you put your mind.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And this book is a guide
to putting your mind

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:10%
in the place of
consciousness from whence

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:10%
you will attract new
possibilities no matter

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:10%
what has occurred.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.678 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, OK,
I'm going to grab

00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:30.591 align:middle line:10%
onto that when you said the
universe is self-correcting.

00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How do
you become a match

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.106 align:middle line:10%
for that which in the
universe is self-correcting?

00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: You know, you said
something to me earlier today.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You said I have to get myself
to that vibrational frequency.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So I
want to submit to you

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:10%
a little something you
might want to look at there.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:10%
You don't have
to-- you are that.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: No matter what?

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
If I'm angry?

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
you, the real you,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:90%
is not angry is the point.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make yourself perfect.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is you have to
let go the imperfect thoughts.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:10%
So it's interesting
that you mention anger,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:10%
and you and I talked about
unforgiveness before.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:10%
As long as we dwell
in love, we don't

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:10%
have to make ourselves
a vibrational match.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:10%
You are love.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.174 align:middle line:10%
Who you are is a
vibrational match.

00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I don't have to try?

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: You
don't have to try.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:10%
Our vigilance has to
be I see my anger.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:10%
I see my harshness.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:10%
I see my lack of forgiveness.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:10%
I see my withhold.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.342 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm not showing up.

00:15:35.342 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm focused
on the past or the future

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:10%
rather than dwelling
fully in the present.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm not giving
enough to an effort.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm
stuck in self-pity.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm whining.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:10%
I see where I'm
interpreting negatively.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Those things, that
we give up in order

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:10%
to experience the love
that is who we truly are.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.744 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And you said in the book
that those feelings deactivate

00:15:56.744 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:10%
the law of divine compensation.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Every thought we think
either invites a miracle

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
or blocks a miracle.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, think about that.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Whoo.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So every thought
we think either attracts

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.602 align:middle line:10%
the new opportunity--

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.844 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:14.135 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Activates the
law of divine compensation.

00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Makes you choose
your thoughts very carefully.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Or deactivates
the law of diving compensation.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why prayer and meditation
and disciplining the mind--

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.465 align:middle line:84%
the word discipline comes from
the same root as disciple.

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:10%
People would say, well,
what is my forgiving,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:10%
praying and meditating
have to do with money?

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:10%
Everything.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:10%
Because it has to do with
who you are in any given

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:10%
moment, which means will
people want to hire you,

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.386 align:middle line:10%
will people want to
promote you, will people

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:10%
see you as a
possibility of where

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:10%
they want to go next
with their business?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And then, how much
are you living your story out

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.139 align:middle line:10%
and playing the story
out in your conversations

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:10%
around money?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.096 align:middle line:10%
There's a great
quote that we have

00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:10%
in the book that says,
"Spiritual growth involves

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:10%
giving up the
stories of your past

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.822 align:middle line:10%
so the universe can
give you new ones."

00:16:57.822 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.988 align:middle line:90%
That you can write a new one.

00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So that for-- what
you're talking about here

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
is to give that story up to
stop the victims or the stories.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Madoff scandal,
all of that, it happened.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And it had happened
for a long time.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot going on.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
We could just give
up that story.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
easy, Marianne.

00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, there are
two levels of things here.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:10%
First of all, most
people are not

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:10%
going through economic crisis in
this country because of Bernie

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:10%
Madoff.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.951 align:middle line:10%
We're going because of banks,
Wall Street, politicians,

00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:10%
and et cetera.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And some of that story
is very important,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:10%
because every American--
every generation

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.301 align:middle line:10%
is a steward of
American democracy.

00:17:36.301 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
We don't want to
turn away from that

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:10%
in the name of spirituality.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:10%
The story of how we got here
is important in the sense

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:10%
of us making it right.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Accountability.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.931 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:49.716 align:middle line:10%
So spirituality does
not lessen our IQ.

00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
What we want to give up
is the personal story

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
where we see ourselves
at the effect of that.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:10%
The poor me, the self pitying,
because you know that no matter

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:10%
what is happening in
the world-- and the name

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving to that aspect
of universal principle,

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.887 align:middle line:10%
the law of divine compensation.

00:18:09.887 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:10%
As the "Course in
Miracles" says there

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:10%
is no order of
difficulty in miracles.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:10%
I was reading an article
about how many of the Fortune

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:10%
500 companies were
founded during recessions.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
statistics around that.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Hewlett-Packard.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So even
when there is a recession,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:90%
it's not that there's no money.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:10%
If that's the money's not
circulating the way it should.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:10%
It's not that somehow
there's less money.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:10%
There's less money circulating.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:10%
So you want to be lifted to
the vibrational frequency

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:10%
where some of that's going
to circulate your way.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Aha.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a glimpse into it.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Though I really love
what you are saying here

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:10%
is that there is a divine order.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:10%
As you say, the law
of divine compensation

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:10%
exists in the universe.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:10%
"A Course of Miracles" says
that the formula for miracles

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:10%
exists in the universe.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's the
handwriting of God.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Marianne lectures at
a church locally here,

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:90%
at a theater locally here.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a theater,
and I want to show

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
you a video of
Marianne in action.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.425 align:middle line:84%
Just things come through
you that are so poignant.

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:16.034 align:middle line:10%
They just give me chills
as I'm sitting here.

00:19:16.034 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:10%
I want you to take a
look at that video.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:10%
In every great religion,
and religious and spiritual

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:10%
philosophy, there is
always this notion

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:10%
of paradise, this idea
of some perfect place.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And the idea of
paradise is this idea

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:10%
of some place
where we have been,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:10%
and we're a longing
to get back to.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, why would it be
this primal archetype?

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Why would it be in
all the religions?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:10%
Why would it be in
all the philosophies,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:10%
the idea of the promised
land, the idea of heaven,

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:10%
this place we go to?

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, it became
in traditional Christianity,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:10%
this idea of a place
we go to after we die.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:10%
But we don't go there
after we die physically

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:10%
from an esoteric
perspective, we go there

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:10%
after we die to who we are.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:10%
So the things of this
world can bring us

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:10%
sort of temporary sursis
from existential pain.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:10%
But the real
happiness that we want

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:10%
is the soul's longing for
that condition of paradise.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:10%
And the ego says, well, it will
be paradise when I have this,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:10%
or it will be paradise
when I have that.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, the
sad game of that

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:10%
is that you get that,
and somehow it's

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:10%
never quite all the things
you thought it would be.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:10%
That's because what we
really long for is paradise.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:10%
What we really long
for is the real world.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:10%
And the real world is that
which lies beyond this world

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.959 align:middle line:10%
entirely.

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
"A Course of Miracles"

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:10%
says that the ascetic
who denies the world

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:10%
is just making the flip
mistake of someone who

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:10%
throws themselves into
the world too much.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:10%
Neither can find joy here.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:10%
The joy that we
all seek is found

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:10%
when we appreciate
our presence here,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:10%
but we recognize
that the real world

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:10%
lies beyond the
perceptual filter.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:10%
The perceptual filter
that is taught us

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:10%
by the thought system
that dominates this world.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:10%
In "A Course of
Miracles," it says

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:10%
that you did not
author yourself.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:10%
God authored you.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:10%
It's not something we
create, and to the extent

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:10%
to which we think it is ours
to create to that extent,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:10%
we are off.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:10%
We have disconnected ourselves
with that which is our source.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And to the extent to which we
have disconnected ourselves

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:10%
from that which is
our source, we're

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:10%
not receiving the
energy which is

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:10%
both the essence of who we are.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:10%
But also, you're not just a
particle, you're also a wave.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:10%
When you have an
authority problem,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:10%
it is always because you believe
you are the author of yourself

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:10%
and project your
delusion onto others.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:10%
So that's the second mistake.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:10%
If I'm unclear
about who I really

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:10%
am, not recognizing that I'm
an idea in the mind of God,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:10%
I will also be incorrect
in my assessment of you.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:10%
Because when I'm not in a very
clear fundamental understanding

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:10%
of who I am and
where I came from,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:10%
not as something that is
up to me to decide, well,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:10%
who are you?

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:10%
Decide who you want to be.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:10%
When you realize you don't
decide who you want to be.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:10%
You realize who you already are.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:10%
If I'm disconnected from the
realization of who I am, then

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:10%
by definition, I'm
not in my right mind.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And when I'm not
in my right mind,

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:10%
I won't see you
as you truly are.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:10%
You then perceive
the situation as one

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:10%
in which others are
literally fighting you

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:10%
for your authorship.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:10%
So then I get into a
realm of consciousness

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:10%
where I don't recognize
that you are one with me.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:10%
If I realized that
I am a child of God,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:10%
that I'm just an idea
in the mind of God,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:10%
then, and only then,
do I get to realize

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:10%
that you are the same thing.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:10%
And on that realm, there is
no separation between us.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:10%
On that realm, there is
no competition between us.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:10%
If my energy is not coming
from love, compassion,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:10%
and forgiveness by whatever
name I give it, then

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:10%
I am making a
world that will not

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:10%
be happy for myself
and others by the way.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:10%
But, "A Course in
Miracles" says illusions

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:10%
are as powerful in their
effects as is the truth.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:10%
So free will is that I can
think whatever I want to think.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:10%
It's like I can make my theme
that I'm a daughter of God,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:10%
or I could make my
theme something else.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:10%
But to the extent to which
I make it something else

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:10%
as "A Course of Miracles"
says, the vision of one world

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:10%
costs you the
vision of the other.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.089 align:middle line:10%
So when I get lost in the story
and in the manufactured made up

00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:10%
illusions of the world,
what are you going to be?

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:10%
What's your brand?

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.901 align:middle line:10%
What are you going to do?

00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:10%
What's your strategy?

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:10%
How you gonna make it happen?

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:10%
I, by definition, am
entering into a realm

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:10%
where I'm always
going to be seeking

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:10%
and I'm never going
to be finding.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Just as the Holy Spirit
speaks with your voice,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:10%
the ego speaks with
your voice, too.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.155 align:middle line:10%
But you kind of know when it's
the ego when the ego says,

00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:10%
got to do this, got to do that,
got to do this, got to do that.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:10%
It is more likely to be God when
it says just sit down, relax,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.431 align:middle line:10%
have some tea.

00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: What do you think
when you watch yourself talk?

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:10%
I just see spirit
coming through you.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.945 align:middle line:10%
Do you recognize those
words as your own?

00:24:33.945 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: No,
I'm a vain person.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.802 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like the
way the shirt looked.

00:24:37.802 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:10%
People who work with me
know that we must never

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:10%
play a tape for me.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:90%
We must never watch it.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But it's because you're
in the moment at that time

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:10%
though, and you are
infused with conversations.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:10%
So about the law of
divine competition.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.674 align:middle line:10%
When you have anger
and resentment--

00:25:00.674 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:10%
let's talk a little
bit more about that.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Does it cancel out
this wonderful law

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:10%
that's existing in the universe.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: It deactivates it.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.233 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It deactivates it.

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: It
deactivates it, but this

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:10%
is where a book like
this is spiritual rather

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:10%
than just mental.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.634 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times in life it's
not as simple as saying, OK,

00:25:18.634 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:10%
I'll just think differently.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:10%
If somebody, lets say,
took $20,000 from you,

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:10%
or if somebody you
were unfairly let

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:10%
go of your job, or
somebody sabotaged you,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:10%
or somebody exploited
you, I mean,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.414 align:middle line:10%
it's not so easy as
just say, OK, I'll

00:25:33.414 --> 00:25:34.538 align:middle line:10%
think about it differently.

00:25:34.538 --> 00:25:35.255 align:middle line:10%
I won't be angry.

00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And that's where
God or some higher power,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:10%
as you understand God, comes in.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:10%
You say, I am angry, but
I'm willing not to be.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
spiritual power comes in.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:10%
It's not as simple
sometimes as just saying,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:10%
think another thought.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
If it was all that easy, we'd
all be enlightened masters.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I have to say, I
mean, coming from experience,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:10%
I can say that I'm going to
forgive but not right way,

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.727 align:middle line:10%
because it hurts.

00:26:03.727 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Right.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It physically does.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's a
process, but you come to--

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It takes a little bit.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.585 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Of
course, it does,

00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:10%
and you come to realize you're
forgiving out of self-interest.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Because I can only have what
I'm willing to grant you.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:10%
So if once I realize that
my anger is not hurting you,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:10%
you're not even thinking
about this incident anymore,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:10%
but it's keeping the universe
from getting through to me,

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:10%
because it can only come
through a conduit of love.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
My anger and my unforgiveness
is not hurting you.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting me.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So essentially, that
universe is ready to provide.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:10%
It's ready to provide, and
it hits me, and it goes no.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That's
exactly right.

00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:10%
Because every moment I'm either
open to love or my heart,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.329 align:middle line:10%
I have a wall in
front of my heart.

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:49.828 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:26:49.828 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a wall in
front of my heart to you.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a lot in
front of my heart to you,

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I have a wall in front
of my heart period,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
because there is no separation.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So if I won't be an open
thing of love to you,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:84%
the universe can't
express its love for me.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not
about pretending.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about saying,
I am so angry.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:10%
This triggers me
on such a level,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:10%
but dear God, I am
willing not to be,

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:10%
and this is where we invite
spirit to come into our minds.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:10%
I surrender my anger.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You're a mother of five,
and you're working three jobs,

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and you come home and you're
trying and you're upset.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:10%
You're angry about that.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:10%
How do you turn that into love?

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:10%
How do you do that?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
you ask God's help.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.395 align:middle line:10%
You ask God's help.

00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes in the
spiritual conversation,

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.834 align:middle line:90%
we infantilize people.

00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
All the questions
come back, well,

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
how do people do it who are
having a hard time doing

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:84%
it, rather than having a
conversation about people

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:90%
who are working on doing it.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And more people understand this
when you talk to them about it

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.755 align:middle line:84%
then you'd think from
listening to people

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:56.401 align:middle line:84%
ask about how hard it
is for all these people.

00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The conversation
should be around what

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
about those who are
really working, right?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:10%
And I find that many of
the people I know who've

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.400 align:middle line:10%
been the equivalent of
the mother of the five

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:10%
who can't find a job are more
open than we might think.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.097 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because they
want to make it work.

00:28:11.097 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So we infantilize.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why we do
that in this community,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:10%
but I hear that a lot.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:10%
What about the person
who finds it hard?

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, you go to
the worst case scenario,

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:10%
and then you work backwards.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's true.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:10%
What do most of the people say
that are in your lectures, that

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:10%
are in your rooms,
that they come

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.872 align:middle line:10%
to you, what are their
complaints about money?

00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, exactly
what we're talking about.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.239 align:middle line:10%
But then if we're
talking about this,

00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:10%
they really often
will say, would you

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:10%
like to say a prayer together?

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:10%
This is the issue.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.175 align:middle line:10%
The universe works on the
level of cause and effect.

00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:10%
That's the law that
rules the universe.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:10%
In the East it's called karma.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:10%
In the West, it's
called cause and effect.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:10%
You can't ask the universe to
change the effect if you're not

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.830 align:middle line:10%
willing to change the cause.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:10%
Your thinking is the
root cause of everything,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:10%
even if it's not what caused
the problem, your interpretation

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:10%
of it and where you stand
within the circumstance

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.570 align:middle line:10%
now will determine
whether or not

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:10%
a miraculous
breakthrough now occurs.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So the issue has to do
with dear God, I am angry,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:90%
but I'm willing not to be.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I tell the
story in the book about a time

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:90%
when I lost $10,000.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, hold
that one thought.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:10%
I want you to come
back with that story.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:10%
When we come back,
we're going to hear more

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:10%
about Marianne Williamson's
story and her incredible book,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:10%
"The Law of Divine
Compensation."

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.749 align:middle line:10%
We'll be right back.

00:29:29.749 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Welcome,
to the next evolution

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.342 align:middle line:90%
of Conscious Media Network.

00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have been with
us throughout our journey.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, as a result of our
partnership with GaiamTV.com,

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
we're able to reach
more independent,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
progressive thinkers like you.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the hundreds
of interviews for CMN,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm now able to do twice as
many interviews each month

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:10%
with the leading visionaries
and authors of our time.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:10%
This is possible because of
Gaiam TV's genuine commitment

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.174 align:middle line:10%
to preserve and expand this kind
of groundbreaking information.

00:29:59.174 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN BORYSENKO: I have
a great deal of faith

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:10%
that this universe
is a friendly place.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
GaiamTV.com is

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:84%
destined to become the largest
portal of conscious media

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.295 align:middle line:90%
intended to awaken and inspire.

00:30:10.295 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:10%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: We don't
just live in the universe,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.091 align:middle line:10%
the universe lives in us.

00:30:14.091 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I could not be
happier with this partnership

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.547 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities that
lie ahead for all of us.

00:30:18.547 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. JOE DISPENZA:
Most people really

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:10%
are thinking the same way
every day, acting the same way,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.624 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the same way,
but really hoping something

00:30:25.624 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:10%
will show up differently in
their life, and it never does.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Other well known faces
in the alternative media scene

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:10%
will also be collaborating
with GaiamTV.com

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.549 align:middle line:10%
to provide even
more perspectives.

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD C. HOAGLAND:
Did the Mayans

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.618 align:middle line:10%
understand about
hyperdimensional, torsion field

00:30:39.618 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:10%
physics?

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I think I can prove they did.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In addition to my
live interviews from Gaiam TV

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:84%
studios, Scott and I
will still be traveling

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.187 align:middle line:84%
around the world for other
exclusive interviews.

00:30:51.187 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY BIGELSEN: You've got
pharmaceutical commercials

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:10%
telling you go to
see your doctor this,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:10%
go to tell your doctor that.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.572 align:middle line:90%
It's a brainwashing.

00:30:58.572 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
I wanted to give you

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:10%
a quick preview of
GaiamTV.com, so you

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:10%
can see what's being
made available for you

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.522 align:middle line:10%
as a result of this partnership.

00:31:06.522 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: This
is in the late 1400s.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes who

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:10%
built these structures, the
answer was we don't know.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is not what you'll
read in history books today.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.469 align:middle line:90%
I have a big problem with that.

00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll find
curated consciousness

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
expanding films, thought
provoking documentaries,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
engaging TV shows,
and much more.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for the next
evolution of conscious media.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:53.935 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.935 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my
guest is spiritual author,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:10%
Marianne Williamson.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:10%
She wrote a book called, "The
Law of Divine Compensation,"

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.104 align:middle line:10%
one of her many books.

00:32:04.104 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:10%
And so you were going
to tell us a story

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:10%
before the break about
your story around this.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: It
was many years ago.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:10%
I think it was in the 1980s,
and I was lecturing here

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:10%
weekly in Los Angeles.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:10%
And I decided to do
an evening of a mix

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.124 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual conversation
and musical entertainment,

00:32:21.124 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:10%
and I thought it
was a great idea.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And actually, it was great,
except marketing genius that I

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.380 align:middle line:10%
was not, I decided not to
really tell people what it was.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to surprise
them once they got there,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.189 align:middle line:10%
so I would tell people-- the
dumbest idea-- I told people

00:32:36.189 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:10%
in my lecture, you
really want to go,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.046 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't describe it.

00:32:39.046 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know how to say, it's
going to be so incredible.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.220 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:10%
As a consequence, not all
that many people came,

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:10%
and I had rented
this big theater.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.547 align:middle line:10%
And everybody who was
there said, oh, my God,

00:32:48.547 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:10%
if I'd known how great it was,
I would have brought 10 people.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:10%
It just broke my heart.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:10%
So my father and mother
had flown in from Houston.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:10%
And my father comes backstage,
little sister, it was great.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And I burst into tears, and
I said, daddy, it was a bomb.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:10%
He said, what do you
mean it was a bomb?

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:10%
I said, I lost $10,000.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:10%
His response to me was,
oh, hell, little sister.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:10%
First of all, he said,
I'm really proud of you

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.902 align:middle line:10%
that you made $10,000
that you could risk.

00:33:18.902 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:10%
He said and I'm proud of
you that you risked it

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:10%
on something wonderful.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:10%
He said if somebody
gives you a problem,

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:10%
you just tell them I
can absorb the loss.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.192 align:middle line:10%
You just tell them you
can absorb the loss.

00:33:30.192 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:10%
So in the days after that,
there was a friend of mine

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:10%
who was in the show,
a woman named, Toni.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.430 align:middle line:10%
And Toni was,
because she loves me,

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:10%
horrified that
I've lost $10,000,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:10%
and she kept going on and on.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.137 align:middle line:10%
Well, her upset would
only increase mine.

00:33:45.137 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And make it worse.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.969 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So I
would say to her, Toni,

00:33:47.969 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:10%
I can absorb the loss.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:10%
Toni, I can absorb the loss.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:10%
So now whenever anything
like that would happen to me,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:10%
and any time I meet
somebody, you just declare,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:10%
"I can absorb the loss,"
because the universe can.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:10%
The first sentence in
"A Course in Miracles"

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:10%
is that there is no order
of difficulty in miracles.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:10%
If it's a small hole, a
big hole in the ocean,

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:10%
doesn't matter the shape of the
hole or the size of the hole,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:10%
the universe has enough water.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.630 align:middle line:10%
And that is the law of
divine compensation,

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:10%
that even if there is material
lack or material diminishment,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:10%
there is, in the realm
of spiritual substance,

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:10%
a capacity to compensate for
the lack or the diminishment

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.906 align:middle line:10%
on the material plane.

00:34:27.906 --> 00:34:29.489 align:middle line:10%
That's the law of
divine compensation.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Is there a difference
between material wealth

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual wealth?

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:10%
In this context that
you're talking about here,

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.920 align:middle line:10%
are you specifically
talking about money?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:10%
Or you're talking about wealth
of love, wealth of abundance,

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:10%
those types of vague wealth?

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
wealth of love,

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:10%
love cannot be diminished
in the universe.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.668 align:middle line:10%
The only way love
can be diminished

00:34:50.668 --> 00:34:52.449 align:middle line:10%
in the universe
is if we ourselves

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:10%
refuse to generate it.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:10%
So in the universe,
the whole point

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:10%
is that on the spiritual
plane, there is no lack.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:10%
It's only on the material plane
that lack and diminishment

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:10%
can show up.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.010 align:middle line:10%
So the universe is
set up for healing.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.070 align:middle line:10%
There could be
psychological wounding.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.647 align:middle line:10%
There can be emotional wounding.

00:35:10.647 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.979 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And even
then, because there

00:35:12.979 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:10%
is no spot where
love is not, even

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:10%
when we are psychologically
damaged or emotionally damaged,

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:10%
they say time heals.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:10%
Situations heal.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:10%
We can be healed.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:10%
So the universe always
has a healing mechanism.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.239 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then how do
you tap, I guess, into it?

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:10%
Look about relationships, I
mean, so many relationships

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.250 align:middle line:10%
that are devastated by finances.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:10%
Fighting about money, it really
takes apart a relationship.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.580 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: I think one of
the things that Americans need

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:10%
to do is we need to put
our intimate relationships

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.820 align:middle line:10%
in a sacred container.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:10%
I think we let-- It's like
if you have an intimate love,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.970 align:middle line:10%
and marriages
should be this way,

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:10%
love affairs should be this
way, family should be this way,

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.507 align:middle line:10%
you need to put it in
a psychic container.

00:35:56.507 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's why families who
pray together stay together.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.811 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: The Catholics
are right about that.

00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not just because there's
an injunction against divorce.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's because you have to
decide what's important here,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and if you let things like
money-- money comes and goes.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole idea of
for richer or for poorer, hello,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.199 align:middle line:84%
that our love will
not be based on this.

00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But too many Americans,
you have the TV on,

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:90%
you have the salt of modernity.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.470 align:middle line:10%
That's why a Sabbath is
very important concept,

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.655 align:middle line:10%
that one day of the week, we
will turn off the electronics,

00:36:26.655 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:10%
and we will just
be with each other.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And if we do not
build, we do not

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:10%
work at building this sacred
substance of our relationships

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:10%
enough in order that
they are protected,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:10%
that's what spending
time together does.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:10%
Turning off the TV,
turning off the computers,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.700 align:middle line:10%
doing things together,
communicating

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.302 align:middle line:10%
at a deep level,
parents, children.

00:36:48.302 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because in
the big picture,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:10%
it shouldn't matter what you--

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, I mean
it's a very stressful thing.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is not
about denying that.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:10%
No, Susie, mommy and daddy can't
pay for your ballet classes

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:10%
this year.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:10%
This is not like there's
no point minimizing it,

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.600 align:middle line:10%
it's the point how
much mommy and daddy

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:10%
are able to hold it that,
you know, Susie, guess what?

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to do ballet
this year, but guess what?

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We found this park
that we can all

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:84%
go take free swing
dances this year.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.490 align:middle line:10%
It's what you-- how you can
emotionally and psychologically

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:10%
compensate.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:10%
Because if the parents just
implode, then, of course,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:10%
the children will
just follow suit.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.441 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And, well, then
look at the relationship,

00:37:30.441 --> 00:37:32.525 align:middle line:10%
then, between the
parents, because any time

00:37:32.525 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:10%
that they spend
together is spent

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:10%
on financial
conversations and things

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.037 align:middle line:10%
they can't do our buy
because of finances.

00:37:38.037 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:10%
It would take the relationship
in a completely different

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.871 align:middle line:10%
direction.

00:37:40.871 --> 00:37:42.536 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And
that goes back to what

00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:10%
we were talking about earlier
about the psychic crisis

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:10%
that it is for men more than for
women when they can't produce,

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:10%
they can't support
their families.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.400 align:middle line:10%
This is not just a
material crisis for a man

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:10%
much more than for a woman.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.729 align:middle line:10%
It's an emotional and
psychological crisis.

00:37:56.729 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I
think it's important

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.375 align:middle line:10%
that women understand
this and do everything

00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:05.130 align:middle line:10%
that we can to make sure that
the man-- the last thing he

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:10%
needs is the emasculation
of feeling like his family

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:10%
doesn't respect him.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.435 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That he can't provide.

00:38:09.435 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.420 align:middle line:10%
It's important.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.160 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So there are
deep issues involved here.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Especially
with women making money

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:10%
and being in the workforce,
and it not being a competition.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Right.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.198 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And that's
something that's

00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:10%
very important is that if a
woman is working and bringing

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:10%
in money, it shouldn't
demasculate a man.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.150 align:middle line:10%
But there's ways to
do it where you still

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.480 align:middle line:10%
maintain the relationship
and be partners, and be

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.360 align:middle line:10%
equals, and still
feel like you have

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:10%
that wonderful-- a man
needs to feel in some way

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.910 align:middle line:10%
that he is a protector
or in some way

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:10%
the man in the relationship.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: I agree with that.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I've
experienced that same thing,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and I have an amazing
relationship with my husband.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:10%
And he looks at that as I
don't rely on him to provide,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:10%
but I do not say you're
wrong for not doing

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.260 align:middle line:10%
that so, therefore,
we have a totally

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:10%
equal wonderful relationship
in terms of finances,

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.660 align:middle line:10%
and it's not a problem.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a
competition, it's fun,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:10%
but it's also a
great conversation.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I'm reminded of
my mother-in-law who

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:10%
is 75, lost her pension,
lost her savings

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:10%
when a lot of things
change in terms

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:10%
of the rules and
laws of finances.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:10%
She lost a lot of money there,
and she can't find a job now.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:10%
She's 75, "nobody
wants to hire me."

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:10%
I get a lot of those
callers on my radio show.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:10%
What do I do if I am
older, and I'm not

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.400 align:middle line:10%
hireable at this point in time?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
you know, I'm not

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:10%
minimizing the problem
on a material plane,

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.004 align:middle line:10%
but the universe is
infinitely malleable.

00:39:45.004 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:10%
We don't believe in a God who
says, "I'd love to help you,

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:10%
but you're over 75."

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:10%
And you know, if the
whole universe is

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:10%
run by a consciousness,
number one,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:10%
that we know we don't need
1,000 jobs, we need one.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.225 align:middle line:10%
And also, if the
entire society, it

00:40:00.225 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:10%
used to be that parents came
in, lived with families more.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything
relates to everything.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:10%
And in a society where old
people are so disposable,

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:10%
and we sort of throw them
away, that's as big a problem.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.690 align:middle line:10%
So theoretically, when
everything works together,

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:10%
the older person
doesn't have to fear

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:10%
so much, because you take
care of your parents.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:10%
You take care of those who
years ago took care of you.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:10%
In other countries it
is that way more so

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:10%
than it is in this country.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.690 align:middle line:10%
We have a little bit
of that to get back to.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.746 align:middle line:10%
So there are some
incredible quotes

00:40:32.746 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:10%
in the book that I
wanted to just share

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.350 align:middle line:10%
with people, because you
have a way of bringing

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:10%
things home that make it zing.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:10%
But this particular one
is about aligning yourself

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.720 align:middle line:10%
with thoughts of infinite love.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:10%
And this is kind of the
how-to in my mind of getting

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:10%
to that place, of that
vibrational match if you will

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, of the
universe's ability to provide.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:10%
Can you explain that quote.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:10%
It's the "By aligning
yourself with thoughts

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:10%
of infinite love for
yourself and others,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.729 align:middle line:10%
you gain dominion over the lower
thought forms of the world."

00:41:04.729 --> 00:41:05.770 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean by that?

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: You
are at the effect

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:10%
of the laws that
prevail within the world

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.682 align:middle line:10%
that you identify with.

00:41:12.682 --> 00:41:14.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah, break
that down a little bit.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: OK.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:10%
If I identify with higher
thought forms of love,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:10%
I am standing my ground
in the spiritual universe,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:10%
because the
spiritual universe is

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:10%
that which emanates from love.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:10%
And then I am
under the laws that

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.060 align:middle line:10%
prevail within a
world that loves me,

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:10%
and which is invested in my
higher good and the higher good

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:10%
of all living things
past, present, and future.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:10%
It's counterintuitive,
but the way

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:10%
to have effectiveness and
power within the material plane

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:10%
is to know that you're
not of the material plane.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:10%
The material plane is ruled
by lower thought forms.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:10%
Thought forms of
fear, ain't it awful,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:10%
scarcity, doubt,
it'll never happen,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.777 align:middle line:10%
it's all gone to hell
in a hand basket.

00:41:59.777 --> 00:42:00.360 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And if that's
the world you identify with,

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:90%
then that will be your reality.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where spirituality
becomes so important.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:90%
We are mortal beings.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.270 align:middle line:10%
We are material
beings, but the point

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:10%
is that we are so
much more than that.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.869 align:middle line:10%
This is like a precious,
priceless suit of clothes

00:42:15.869 --> 00:42:16.660 align:middle line:10%
that we're wearing.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.520 align:middle line:10%
That's what the body is,
but this is not who we are.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:10%
That's why enlightenment is
the answer to everything.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment is the realization
that the birth of the body

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.330 align:middle line:10%
was not the beginning,
it was the continuation.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:10%
The death of the body
will not be an end.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:10%
It's a continuation.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:10%
You and I are not trapped
here in our bodies.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We are part of a
larger order of things,

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like when
Jesus said in the Sermon

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.890 align:middle line:84%
on the Mount, "Did God not
cloth the lilies of the field?

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.350 align:middle line:10%
Surely, he will
take care of you."

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:10%
And there are objective,
discernible laws

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.325 align:middle line:10%
of the internal
universe just as there

00:42:53.325 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:10%
are objective, discernible
laws of the external universe.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:10%
If I drop this book, I know
that it will fall to the ground.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
This is not because I
have faith in gravity.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It's because I understand
the laws of gravity.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And same with love.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.947 align:middle line:10%
If my heart is open,
miracles will happen.

00:43:07.947 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That is a great example.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.829 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And when
I close, it won't.

00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
with spiritual exercise

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and you say how to, how to,
you do spiritual exercise

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:84%
through prayer,
through meditation,

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:90%
through spiritual practice.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:10%
It's no different than
physical exercise.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.810 align:middle line:10%
Because whether you're talking
about your physical muscles

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:10%
or your attitudinal muscles,
after a certain age if you're

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.430 align:middle line:10%
not working at keeping
them up, their headed down.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: True.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.539 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: So you work
it, and it's like yoga, too.

00:43:33.539 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:10%
Am I in the right position?

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.134 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: You're
working your body,

00:43:37.134 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:10%
but it's your emotional body,
your psychological body,

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:10%
your energetic body.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So what do you do?

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.300 align:middle line:10%
What practices do you do?

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON:
Well, I'm a student

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:10%
of "A Course of Miracles."

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:10%
I also do transcendental
meditation.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:10%
But the most important thing,
so I do pray and meditate

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.360 align:middle line:10%
every day, but the most
important thing is to work it.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:10%
When I'm triggered, if
somebody does something

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:10%
and I could be angry
about it, forgiveness.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:10%
I always say my life
works pretty well when

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:10%
I practice what I preach.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I don't
practice what I preach,

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.912 align:middle line:90%
these are impersonal laws.

00:44:09.912 --> 00:44:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You see the
difference between the two.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.661 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:44:12.661 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, it's a
whole different me.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.744 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is your
relationship with money?

00:44:17.744 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: My
relationship with money

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:24.540 align:middle line:10%
is that I'm very blessed
and privileged that I've

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:10%
had some successful books.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Where my weaknesses have been
has been, particularly earlier

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:10%
in my career, not
managing it well.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.630 align:middle line:10%
When I first made money back
when my first book came out,

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.700 align:middle line:10%
I made a mistake that I think
many people make when they just

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.690 align:middle line:10%
make money quickly.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was
more than it was,

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.750 align:middle line:10%
because it was
more than I'd seen.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
receiving in my mind

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:10%
that I shouldn't do anything.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:10%
And I can see now why
that was my guidance.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.530 align:middle line:10%
Be in this new situation and
grow energetically into it.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:10%
I should have
learned about money.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:08.080 align:middle line:10%
I should have grown
said, OK, I have money

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:10%
that I've never had
before, make me worthy.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.537 align:middle line:10%
Now become responsible, mature--

00:45:16.537 --> 00:45:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Accountable.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Accountable, sober
around it, emotionally sober.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.000 align:middle line:10%
And instead, I lived in
LA, got to buy a house.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.990 align:middle line:10%
And I can see where it took
me-- it was interesting

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:10%
when that happened,
because I was spiritually

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.830 align:middle line:10%
evolved enough to attract money,
but I wasn't psychologically

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.221 align:middle line:10%
evolved enough to deal with
it well once it got here.

00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That actually
makes perfect sense.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.730 align:middle line:10%
That's that marriage between
spiritual and physical

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.105 align:middle line:10%
where you create
it in one level,

00:45:46.105 --> 00:45:47.688 align:middle line:10%
but you have to be
practical about it.

00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:48.370 align:middle line:90%
You have to be.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:49.995 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
you have to embody.

00:45:49.995 --> 00:45:52.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to become the
person who is the container.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.439 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had my ups and downs
like everybody else has had.

00:45:56.439 --> 00:45:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then how is
your relationship with it

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.210 align:middle line:90%
now compared to then?

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.450 align:middle line:10%
How did it change?

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: My
ego mind sometimes

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:10%
goes into, oh, I wish
that I'd been smarter back

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:10%
in the 90s when my
first book came out.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:10%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:10%
So it's one of those
when you say give up

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.570 align:middle line:10%
your story so the universe
can write a new one,

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:21.720 align:middle line:10%
I think, I like many, many
people look at the 90s,

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:10%
and go, oh, my God, if only
I'd saved my money then.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.159 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, well, I
mean, you could basically

00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:10%
read any page in your book
and just give yourself

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.820 align:middle line:10%
a huge lesson.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.820 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.564 align:middle line:10%
You teach what
you need to learn.

00:46:34.564 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.896 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: So the book is the
sharing of what I have learned.

00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:40.560 align:middle line:10%
And in that book I talk about,
as I talk about in all my work,

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:10%
I've learned, as I
think most people have,

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.515 align:middle line:10%
as much from my failures
as my successes.

00:46:44.515 --> 00:46:45.890 align:middle line:10%
As much from where
I've gotten it

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:10%
wrong as where I've
gotten it right.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.373 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes something
you learn through failure,

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:10%
you learn the hard way
is almost a lesson more

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:53.210 align:middle line:10%
powerfully learned.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's why it's
good to write about it,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:10%
because then you get to share
your lessons with other people.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.060 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah, hopefully.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.150 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: There's
another quote that I

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.525 align:middle line:10%
think is really
powerful when you

00:46:59.525 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:10%
talk about, "The universe
is the handwriting of God,

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:10%
and is both self-organizing
and self-correcting,"

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:10%
which we've been
talking a lot about.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:10%
"Where there is
lack, the universe

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:10%
is already planning to remove
it from your circumstances."

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.600 align:middle line:10%
Where there is
lack, the universe

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:10%
is willing and ready to remove
it from your circumstances.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:10%
If we could just have
that in our minds,

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:10%
if we could really
believe that, that's

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:10%
what the entire law of
divine compensation is?

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: "A
Course of Miracles"

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:10%
says that whenever
there is a problem,

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.730 align:middle line:10%
God creates the solution at
the moment the problem occurs.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.570 align:middle line:10%
The Native American
Indians used to say

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:10%
that if there is a
poison in the forest,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:10%
the antidote to the poison is
within a certain number of feet

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.540 align:middle line:10%
away.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:10%
And so when you live from
a spiritual perspective,

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.910 align:middle line:10%
you know if there's a problem,
the answer is probably closer

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:10%
than I think.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:10%
One of the areas where
I've seen this in my life,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.690 align:middle line:10%
where I can see all
the times when I just--

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:10%
do you ever realize
you made a mistake,

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.782 align:middle line:10%
you didn't take advantage
of an opportunity,

00:47:59.782 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:10%
you went the wrong way, and
you look back in retrospect

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.719 align:middle line:10%
and you think,
everything I needed

00:48:04.719 --> 00:48:05.760 align:middle line:10%
was right in front of me.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.450 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.116 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Everybody
I needed to talk

00:48:08.116 --> 00:48:09.534 align:middle line:10%
to was right in front of me.

00:48:09.534 --> 00:48:11.950 align:middle line:10%
You know, there's a man named
Mike Dugan who wrote a play.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And there's a line in the
play, "I laughed at the people

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:10%
I should have listened to.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.741 align:middle line:10%
And I listened to the people
I should have laughed at."

00:48:19.741 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is true
with money and business

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.004 align:middle line:10%
as much as anything.

00:48:23.004 --> 00:48:23.920 align:middle line:10%
You're in front of me.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.580 align:middle line:10%
You're my friend, but I'm
assuming you don't know.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.716 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to go get some fancy
person who I think might know.

00:48:29.716 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And you look back
and you realize

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:10%
the universe had put
right in front of me

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:10%
the person who had the
insight that I needed.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you don't realize it's
a self-organizing universe,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.360 align:middle line:84%
you think it must
be somewhere else.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I have to go find a job.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.370 align:middle line:10%
That's like another issue
there that I talk about

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:49.340 align:middle line:10%
in the book is the difference
between a job and a calling.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.460 align:middle line:10%
People are out looking for
jobs, like it's out there

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.705 align:middle line:10%
and I've got to find it.

00:48:53.705 --> 00:48:56.220 align:middle line:10%
But with a career
and a calling, you

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:10%
realize there's something
that organically unfolds

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.750 align:middle line:10%
from the field of
your own being.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:90%
You give birth to it.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.280 align:middle line:10%
There's that story, and most
of us have experienced this,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.840 align:middle line:10%
we've been one character
in the scenario or another.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.260 align:middle line:10%
Let's say there's a
man named William,

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.120 align:middle line:10%
and William has a business idea.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:10%
And he feels absolutely
sure if he could only

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.000 align:middle line:10%
talk to John Kerrigan.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.420 align:middle line:10%
I know John Kerrigan
would like my idea,

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:10%
and John Kerrigan
is a huge investor.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.050 align:middle line:10%
I just know if I could
talk to John Kerrigan.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.259 align:middle line:10%
So he's going to a
party, and you probably

00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:33.550 align:middle line:10%
know where I'm going with this.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:36.080 align:middle line:10%
So William is going to a
party, and he has heard a rumor

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:10%
that John Kerrigan
is going to be there.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.050 align:middle line:10%
So he's talking to people,
but he's really not

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:40.740 align:middle line:10%
even talking to them.

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:10%
He's looking past them to
see if maybe John Kerrigan--

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.050 align:middle line:10%
you know how someone's
really looking past you

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:46.840 align:middle line:10%
for somebody more interesting.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So William is talking to this
nice little old lady, right?

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.237 align:middle line:10%
And John Kerrigan's
mind has, who is she

00:49:53.237 --> 00:49:55.476 align:middle line:10%
and what can she do for me?

00:49:55.476 --> 00:49:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And she's saying, well, tell
me about yourself young man.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:00.690 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I'm just here
ma'am, like he's

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.040 align:middle line:10%
treating her like she's nothing.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.748 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know where
this story is going.

00:50:03.748 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:10%
Later in the evening,
somebody says to William,

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.590 align:middle line:10%
I saw you talking to
John Kerringan's mother.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:10%
Was she a nice woman?

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:10%
And this woman had
tried to talk to him

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.930 align:middle line:10%
and engage him in conversation.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:18.440 align:middle line:10%
So the universe
had brought to him

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:10%
the best conduit by which
to get to John Kerrigan.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.376 align:middle line:10%
But number one, he didn't
realize the universe

00:50:25.376 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:10%
is self-organizing,
so you should

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:10%
be alert to
whatever's happening.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:10%
And number two, his heart
wasn't open to the human being

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.530 align:middle line:10%
who is in front of him.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.040 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So the miracle
just, it went away,

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.320 align:middle line:10%
and it wasn't in here.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.570 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't inside here.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.480 align:middle line:10%
It was out there and
reaching, and planning,

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.430 align:middle line:10%
and going into action.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.005 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: As opposed to
knowing the universe is on it.

00:50:43.005 --> 00:50:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, I
do know where you

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.660 align:middle line:10%
can get into that trap
of wanting to go out

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.490 align:middle line:10%
after the goal, and you set it
into motion and all that stuff,

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:10%
and then you realize
once you just give up--

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:10%
and it's not giving up.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.902 align:middle line:10%
You use a specific word in
the book-- surrendering.

00:50:57.902 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: You know the
"Course of Miracles" says,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.960 align:middle line:10%
liberation is not bursting
out but a gentle melting in.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.495 align:middle line:10%
You know when the
embryo becomes the baby,

00:51:07.495 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:10%
the acorn becomes the oak tree,
the bud becomes the blossom,

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:10%
you and I are
similarly programmed

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.350 align:middle line:10%
to become the highest
best version of ourselves.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:10%
The universe is invested
in our self-actualization.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.866 align:middle line:84%
And the perfect career and
abundance is just part of that.

00:51:23.866 --> 00:51:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Now the difference between
us, and the embryo, the acorn,

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.567 align:middle line:84%
and the bud is
that we can say no.

00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:31.900 align:middle line:10%
We can say, no, I don't want to.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.100 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Those active
minds of ours.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: They can't.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:34.860 align:middle line:10%
Pardon?

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's right.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.001 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: They can't.

00:51:37.001 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They cannot say no to
the self-organizing universe.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.165 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Right,
and you and I can.

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And we can and we do.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And not
only is it that God's plan

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of the universe's plan works,
it's that ours doesn't.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So like that story of
William, he actually

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.730 align:middle line:90%
interfered with the plan.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.021 align:middle line:10%
The plan was bringing everything
to him that he needed,

00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:57.330 align:middle line:10%
but he interfered by
having his own plan.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Self-limiting
thoughts, belief

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can't do it,
that there's scarcity.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That other
people don't matter.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:03.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or that--

00:52:03.835 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: That
love and forgiveness

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.250 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with this.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or that
the wrong person is

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:84%
going to mess me over, and screw
me over, and all that, yes.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Those fear, like those
limiting thoughts.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And
savvy, yes, wise, yes.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So what
is a good practice

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.684 align:middle line:10%
when those thoughts come up?

00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:24.100 align:middle line:10%
If you're watching
this interview,

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.558 align:middle line:10%
and you're getting
this, and you're

00:52:25.558 --> 00:52:28.600 align:middle line:10%
right here with us, what happens
when you come up against that,

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.300 align:middle line:10%
OK, here's one of the
limiting thoughts,

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.389 align:middle line:10%
what do I do with this?

00:52:31.389 --> 00:52:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, if you've
meditated in the morning,

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:10%
it won't come up so much.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:35.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.242 align:middle line:10%
So good step.

00:52:36.242 --> 00:52:37.699 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Every
great religious

00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual tradition
that I've ever

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.930 align:middle line:10%
read about emphasizes the
importance of the morning.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.200 align:middle line:10%
We wake up in the
morning, we take a shower.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.462 align:middle line:10%
You don't want yesterday's
dirt with you on your body

00:52:47.462 --> 00:52:48.420 align:middle line:10%
as you go into the day.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.575 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: But if
we don't meditate,

00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:53.050 align:middle line:10%
we're taking yesterday's
stress into the day.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.090 align:middle line:10%
So why would you be so careful
to wash your body but not

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:10%
your mind and your
consciousness?

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we
want to meditate.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.723 align:middle line:10%
Meditating in the morning,
praying in the morning,

00:53:02.723 --> 00:53:05.160 align:middle line:10%
centering ourselves
in right relationship

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.220 align:middle line:10%
to the universe,
or the chances--

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:10%
and then you know
what Americans do,

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:10%
then we turn on the
TV, or the computer.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:13.890 align:middle line:10%
So not only are you
carrying your own stress,

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.470 align:middle line:10%
you're carrying the stress
of everybody in Syria,

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:19.960 align:middle line:10%
and the economy, and Somalia
and every place else.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.880 align:middle line:10%
So the idea of prayer and
meditation in the morning

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.940 align:middle line:10%
is so that there will not
be as many frantic moments

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.220 align:middle line:10%
where we would be vulnerable
to our own reactiveness

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.520 align:middle line:10%
and our own impulsivity.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:10%
And if we are feeling ourselves,
I'm going insane right now.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm not being my truest self.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:10%
We have a practice by which to
say dear God, please help me.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.736 align:middle line:10%
I need help.

00:53:42.736 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:10%
I know I shouldn't
be feeling this way,

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:10%
but I really am, and
please protect me.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.470 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, I might
push that send button,

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:52.900 align:middle line:10%
I might send a text I'll regret
for of the rest of my life.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:10%
I might send an
email that will not

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.710 align:middle line:10%
be a good email to
have in writing.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.099 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just be aware of it.

00:53:58.099 --> 00:53:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But
it's real difficult

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't centered
yourself in spiritual practice

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.300 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.560 align:middle line:10%
Marianne has a great
clip about the book.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.940 align:middle line:10%
She's actually reading
some of the great quotes

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.990 align:middle line:10%
because there's so
many gems in this book.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:13.729 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this.

00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Hi, I am
Marianne Williamson,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.570 align:middle line:10%
and I have a new book.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's called "The Law
of Divine Compensation."

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.250 align:middle line:10%
In this book I take spiritual
principles and miracle minded

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.550 align:middle line:10%
thinking, and I apply
them very specifically

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:10%
to issues about work,
and money, and career.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.220 align:middle line:10%
Here's a little
bit from the book.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:10%
"When we think of
ourselves as channels

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.640 align:middle line:10%
for the infinite creative
energy of the universe,

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:10%
we think higher thoughts
than how will I get a job.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:39.810 align:middle line:10%
We're lifted to a
realm of consciousness

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.460 align:middle line:10%
where questions like,
how can I best serve

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.750 align:middle line:10%
the world take precedence over
what can I get out of this?

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.700 align:middle line:10%
Within that realm, we
naturally do get a job.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.630 align:middle line:10%
We naturally do create
money, and we naturally

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:10%
do produce an outer
prosperity that

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:10%
reflects the prosperity
in our hearts.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.790 align:middle line:10%
This doesn't mean we don't
have to do the footwork,

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:04.190 align:middle line:10%
but our feet become guided
by a wisdom we might not

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:10%
have even known we had."

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.590 align:middle line:10%
The idea I'm dealing
with here is the idea

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:11.370 align:middle line:10%
that the universe is
both self-organizing and

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:10%
self-correcting.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.030 align:middle line:10%
We are meant to prosper.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:16.570 align:middle line:10%
We are meant to be
lifted to the highest

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:20.440 align:middle line:10%
level of creative possibility
in every area of our lives.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.120 align:middle line:10%
And "The Law of
Divine Compensation"

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:10%
refers to the idea
that even when

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.270 align:middle line:10%
we experience diminishment
within the material plane,

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:10%
within the level of
spiritual substance,

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:10%
there is more than enough
capacity for the universe

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.940 align:middle line:10%
to compensate for any lack.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.880 align:middle line:10%
If those ideas seem
interesting to you,

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.486 align:middle line:10%
I hope that you will
pick up the book.

00:55:40.486 --> 00:55:41.860 align:middle line:10%
And I hope that
you will not only

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.800 align:middle line:10%
read it, but apply
the principles

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.830 align:middle line:10%
and have all of the miracles
that I'm sure you desire.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.000 align:middle line:10%
We all do.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.500 align:middle line:10%
Thanks.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:55.671 align:middle line:90%


00:55:55.671 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I remember your
book, "A Return to Love"

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.419 align:middle line:10%
and you basically rewrote
"A Course of Miracles"

00:56:00.419 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:10%
so that we could understand it.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.690 align:middle line:10%
How long have you been studying
"A Course of Miracles?"

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:05.565 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, yes,
"The Return to Love"

00:56:05.565 --> 00:56:06.979 align:middle line:10%
is like the cliff notes version.

00:56:06.979 --> 00:56:08.770 align:middle line:10%
I've been studying the
"Course of Miracles"

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.910 align:middle line:10%
since 1970s, mid-70s
somewhere, like maybe

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.720 align:middle line:10%
'77, something like that.

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And I started lecturing
about it in 1983.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just give
a brief description

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.450 align:middle line:84%
of what "A Course
of Miracles" is.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:24.241 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: The course
has been described

00:56:24.241 --> 00:56:27.620 align:middle line:10%
as a self-study program of
spiritual psychotherapy.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.330 align:middle line:10%
It is a training in
relinquishing a thought system

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.750 align:middle line:10%
based on fear, and
accepting, instead,

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.020 align:middle line:10%
a thought system based on love.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.700 align:middle line:10%
So in that sense, it's
a course in forgiveness.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And the goal of the course is
the attainment of inner peace.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Many people
treat it like the Bible,

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.170 align:middle line:10%
like their own
version of the Bible

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.376 align:middle line:10%
where they listen to quotes.

00:56:48.376 --> 00:56:49.750 align:middle line:10%
They read it over
and over again,

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:50.960 align:middle line:10%
apply it to different areas.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.450 align:middle line:10%
And as you have throughout
the show, taken these--

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:58.190 align:middle line:10%
I wrote one down, "A shift
in thinking from fear to love

00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:59.037 align:middle line:10%
is the miracle."

00:56:59.037 --> 00:57:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yes, the course
says a shift in perception

00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:02.870 align:middle line:90%
from fear to love.

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:10%
Because since thought
is the level of cause,

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.870 align:middle line:10%
if you want your life
to change, if you

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.369 align:middle line:10%
want the movie to change, you
can't just go up to the screen

00:57:11.369 --> 00:57:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and try to change the plot.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.780 align:middle line:10%
What we experience out
there is the effect

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:15.900 align:middle line:10%
of what we're thinking.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:10%
So if you want a miracle out
there, you shift your thinking.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So the
love is the cause,

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.907 align:middle line:10%
and the reaction is the effect?

00:57:24.907 --> 00:57:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: Right.

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.864 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you have to
shift to that place in love

00:57:27.864 --> 00:57:29.500 align:middle line:90%
for the difference to come in.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMSON: And
love casts out fear

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.260 align:middle line:10%
the same way light
casts out darkness.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.900 align:middle line:10%
You can't fight the darkness,
you just turn on the light.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.250 align:middle line:10%
You can't fight the fear.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.020 align:middle line:10%
We tend to think if
I analyze the fear,

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.950 align:middle line:10%
people say how do I
move past the fear?

that you see your work

you're a businessperson,

00:58:10.986 --> 00:58:12.030 align:middle line:10%
you're a scientist.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:84%

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:18.540 align:middle line:84%
