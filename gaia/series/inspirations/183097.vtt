00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: We all
need more energy.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The type that leads to more
love and success and good health

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
and prosperity
and peace of mind.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm not just talking
about physical energy,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about that very
special type of subtle energy,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:10%
or creation light
that can provide

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:10%
an endless flow of goodness.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
and joining me

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:10%
is the author of 25
books on energy medicine

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:10%
and chakras, Cyndi Dale.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
She's used her psychic
gifts for the last 25 years

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to see into different
realities and provide intuitive

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and energy healing
for over 65,000

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:90%
individuals around the world.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI DALE: Thank you.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's a lot of people.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a lot
of people, yeah!

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to count that high.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I know.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
How did you?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.652 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It means a lot of
years at the work, too.

00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:90%
You have.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You've talked all over
the world and influenced

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:90%
so many different people.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
What motivates you?

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:90%
What guides you to do this?

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: You know, I was
really intuitive as a child,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:10%
and I, for a long time,
thought that was normal.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:10%
I thought everybody saw
angels or spooky stuff,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:10%
or could hear what
was in the wind

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:10%
or feel other people's feelings.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then it didn't
take very long to figure out

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that was really
unusual, but I still

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:90%
wanted to know what that was.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So really the
answer is curiosity.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is this?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
How do people know things
that other people don't know?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
How do I do that?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
I've been propelled

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
by curiosity, and probably
a little bit of fate.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, at every
step of the way

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I've had some kind of message
or guidance of somebody

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
or an inner voice or maybe
a bigger voice saying

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
you need to do this
now, or why don't you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
try this, or go travel to Costa
Rica, or take yourself here.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And I just listened.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think our lives
work better if we listen

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
when we're being ordered
around, especially

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
if it's from a higher source.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.568 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's been
kismet and guidance.

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : At least you know
how to listen, though.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh yeah.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.673 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn how,
though, because I'm also

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
really good at being
stubborn and saying no.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And thinking well,
that's not real, that's not me.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, and
most of my clients,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that's something that
they share, or students.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly asking,
how do I know it's real?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
How do I know if it's
real or if it's fear,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
or if it's imagination,
fantasy, or guidance?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:10%
And you know I always
tell people look,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:10%
I think inside we know.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:10%
It's not just about
getting a pretty picture

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:10%
in the head, or a voice,
or the earth shakes, or--

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:10%
it's not usually something
major that steers us.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a little knowing,
it's an inner voice,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and our body will tell us.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It will be really
clear, this feels good,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't feel good.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I can trust that
dream, I can't trust

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
what showed up in that dream.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So we all have the apparatus to
receive but also distinguish.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And also,
what do you do with it?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Last night I was talking with
a friend about a friend who

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
had passed away,
and we were talking

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
about this person with
reverence and great memories.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And all a sudden, this
breeze came and then

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
it blew up the menu
and covered my mouth.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: [LAUGH]

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : And it just sat there.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we all looked at each
other like what is this?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet?

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.355 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Because--

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do!

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Don't talk, don't eat.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And then the candle
on the table blew out.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh wow.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I know.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.012 align:middle line:84%
So maybe she was just trying
to show she was still around?

00:03:56.012 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know what
to do with the information.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, right--

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Most people don't.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.753 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think a lot of
us don't, and sometimes I

00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:90%
don't know either.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll get a dream that my dad
will show up for something

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and tell me something, and
I wake up and I'm like well,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:90%
what's that all about?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Where do I go next?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a very simple
secret: ask a lot of questions.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:90%
Honestly!

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always relate
to my inner spirit.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of
me that's connected,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
part of everybody
else is connected.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There's guidance, there's
goodness, so I ask questions.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing I
do is I know whatever

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
my guidance is, they're a lot
smarter and more connected

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:90%
than I am.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So I tell them, get the
message through to me.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Look, I'm Norwegian.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We're not very expansive,
we're not terribly creative.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.845 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of
stubborn, you know.

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
We only traveled
the world to get

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
what we wanted, thousands
of hundreds of years ago.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say make sure
I get the message.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Like, make it really clear.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's the old story,
literally if there's

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
a book I'm supposed to read,
just plop it in front of me.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Just let it fall
off the bookshelf.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
If I'm supposed to go do
something, get three people

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:90%
that day telling me what to do.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Give me three license
plates that all

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.793 align:middle line:84%
say something, that is a
marching order, and I'll do it.

00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's great.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Ask for obvious signs.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It works.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
this dog named Honey

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
he's a third reincarnation
of a dog named Honey.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
They're always male golden
retrievers, and the second one

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I had died a few years
ago, and three years

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
after that, I heard this voice
in my head going, I'm back!

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh no, please no.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
He was really wild.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, please, I
don't want to do a puppy.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:90%
And he goes I'm back!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And that very morning,
my son, who loved Honey,

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
came into my room
he goes, mom, I

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
was just searching
the internet and I

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
think I found a dog
we're supposed to get.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh my gosh.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was so resistant.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm like I'm not doing another
puppy, I'm not doing a puppy,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.792 align:middle line:84%
I'm a single mother,
I'm not doing a puppy.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So over the next
three, four days,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Honey was delivered to
my house from Amazon.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:90%
I never ordered.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The dog's name on
the site was Tank--

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to think
Honey and Tank are the same?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere my son and I went,
there were billboards of tanks.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
G.I. Joe tanks, toilet
tanks, whatever it was.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The last straw was I was in
therapy with my therapist,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.635 align:middle line:84%
my guide, and I
said, you know, I

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
know I'm getting
all these signs,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want
to follow them.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a dog free building.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I walked outside of the office.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Guess what, there's a dog
coming at me, nobody around,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:90%
with a leash in its mouth.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like OK, I'll get Honey.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have some flexibility
as human beings.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
We get to say get the message
to me, and do it in a way

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that I'll really do it.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Can you do that same
thing with manifestation?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh my gosh, absolutely.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.983 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : With what
you want to create?

00:06:52.983 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, absolutely.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're
supposed to be able to.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Our birthright is to manifest
what will lead to our purpose.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.343 align:middle line:84%
We're here, everybody
has a purpose.

00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn,
we're here to grow,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
we're here to grow love, and we
have a unique way of doing it.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So doesn't it makes
sense it's our birthright

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.518 align:middle line:84%
to receive what we need to
do what we're here to do?

00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Wouldn't
it be nice, though,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.118 align:middle line:84%
if we were just here to
not grow, and just to--

00:07:18.118 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.378 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm with you.

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And just to
be at peace and relax?

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, and have joy.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Do we have
to grow all the time?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But I think that part
of our purpose is about joy.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we're
here to learn,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
it's also to learn how to
laugh, how to have fun,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
how to be so loving,
how to have joy.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I just think God
giggles all the time

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
when we take things
too seriously.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Yes, I get
that a lot as well.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So we can
manifest ice cream--

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, the version that we
like when we're traveling, just

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
as much as you know a
speaking engagement,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who's going to
teach us that karmic lesson.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So you do
a lot of traveling--

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I do.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --and
this is something--

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.653 align:middle line:84%
so you follow the guidance,
and you take groups on these

00:08:04.653 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:90%
wonderful excursions.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.452 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Tell us
what you do, though.

00:08:08.452 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We have some pictures of some of
the places that you've visited.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
This one picture here
is in a square cave.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, that's down in
Mexico, near Chichen Itza.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But a little known fact is
that behind Chichen Itza

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:90%
is the real Chichen Itza.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
old ancient complex.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.023 align:middle line:84%
And I wandered back
there one day--

00:08:30.023 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I was supposed
to, but here's guidance like,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
keep walking, keep walking.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I led a group down
there as well at a later time.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really the original
site of the ancient Mayan

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
teachers and masters, and
I took a group down there

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to learn about Kundalini.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the Hindu word.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Nearly every culture
talks about that the body

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is equipped with a sort of
divine light, a divine fire

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to access the
spirits, the gods, our higher

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we were
working with down there.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So first of all, it's
nice that it's still preserved

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
in an area that's not so
accessible to the public,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's only
for private tours.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So that
respect the land--

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.355 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --but when you
get into a place like that,

00:09:13.355 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
how do you teach people to
activate that level of fire

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
within them?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I think everybody
does it a somewhat different

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
way, so I make sure that
they know their way is

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.117 align:middle line:90%
going to be their way.

00:09:24.117 --> 00:09:24.917 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I do make sure that
they connect to the ground,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or to the land,
or to the cosmos,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and bring into themselves
whichever subtle elements

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:90%
their system needs.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Wood, earth, air, fire,
star, whatever it might be.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So they need to make a
connection to the land

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
or to the place or the
space that they're in.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And let their body first
be filled, so that they're

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.735 align:middle line:90%
in a safe way and a safe place.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I have them connect
to whatever it is they

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
call their spirit--
greater spirit,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.525 align:middle line:84%
higher spirit, because it
really is about safety.

00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you're
dealing with something

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of divine light or
the divine fire,

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
get set ablaze.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I've had people come
in, 12 years they've

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
been shaking because they just
bring energy in willy nilly,

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't
really customized it

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
or allowed themselves to set
themselves up to adapt to it.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:90%
And then they just feel it.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They can get to know
it, it can be safe,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
you have to feel it in the
body to know it's real.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Then you can get images,
may be messages for it.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So I make sure people are
safe, they're grounded,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.712 align:middle line:84%
and they're connected
to do the work.

00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And so that they just
experience the energy rather

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.587 align:middle line:84%
than bringing this-- because
I've heard that the Kundalini

00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
energy can really flood
the body and kick you out.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Well, it's physical.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, physical
and subtle energies,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
we like to distinguish
between them--

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:90%
they're on the same continuum.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It' just how measurable
versus immeasurable the energy

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.770 align:middle line:90%
is we're working with.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Kundalini,
the subtle energy--

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
well, subtle energy is 90
point whatever percent of what

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:90%
creates reality.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So you bring out a lot
of the invisible energy.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Your physical energy's also
being stirred and ignited,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
comparable to what subtle
energies you're bringing it.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
get electrical pulses,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
biochemical changes,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get your
sympathetic nervous system

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:90%
going, and that's a shock.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So why do
that to ourselves?

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : It's a lot.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I mean, come on.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.975 align:middle line:84%
Let's be a little more
peaceful around it.

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And gentle on the body,
because it really can blow out

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:90%
the circuits.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.205 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, right.

00:11:31.205 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Physical and subtle-- we're
here to be in physical

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and transform it
through our own spirit,

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
through our connections.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.927 align:middle line:90%
But let's be kind to it.

00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Because we have to--

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
I show up for work every day.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't just have a Kundalini
experience and check out.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Right, right.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.218 align:middle line:84%
And you have to show
up for other people.

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And people have jobs,
and they have to show up

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:90%
for their job, and a boss.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to respect
the every day,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
because that's what we're
here to experience, along

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:90%
with the higher sensitivities.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : In the beginning I
talked about this creation

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
light, talking about
subtle energies.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I love
talking about this.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little geeky with it.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I believe
that we are living

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
in two universes at the
same time, or two creations

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And cosmology is starting
to bear this out.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
get told that we're

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in an expanding universe that
started with the Big Bang.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything condensed,
blew up, here we are,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the physical laws of nature
kind of govern it, entropy

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is going downhill
and life is hard.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's kind of the
fallen universe we're living in.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But scientists are suspecting
that there was a precreation

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to that, maybe pre-Big Bang,
maybe before the Big Bang,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Something that
caused the Big Band?

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --something that maybe
caused the Big Bang that's

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
still here with stillness.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
these standing lights,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
or kind of frozen light
in the universe that's

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
still emanating a charge and
a cosmic background radiation.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like we're in
two simultaneously coexisting

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:90%
universes.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
My studies of different
spiritualities, the Torah,

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism, even Christianity, to
be really honest, in Genesis,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
would suggest that perhaps there
was some kind of force that

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:90%
was pre-created, that was here.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
That works with spiritual law,
spiritual principles, goodness,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
what some scientists would
call scalar waves, which

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
are science--

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
like, you know, super
cool waves of energy

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
that seem to make change.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, the rest
of the universe was created.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning was
the void, and there

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:90%
was a light on the void.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
came from there.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So I like to call that
creation light, sort

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of what we're within.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
The heaven that's
here, but we're still

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in this continually
moving universe,

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
where things are hard.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
We learn our tough
lessons, but we can employ

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%
what's in the creation light.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We can connect to oneness,
we can connect into goodness.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all here.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
All the energy
systems, I think, are

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
speaking to how do you
connect to the oneness

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
through this sort
of fallen state

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and transform what's here.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Have you learned
the same thing from shamans

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in your travels?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Do they--

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes!

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : All around the world?

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: This is what they teach.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Same thing?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.313 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: This is what they teach.

00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I was, just a short while ago,
teaching a workshop in Raleigh.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And during the first night,
there were these beautiful

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.343 align:middle line:84%
souls leading a sound chamber,
really sort of like an almost

00:14:40.343 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
sweat lodge-- because
it was so hot in there--

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:90%
fire ceremony.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And this message came
through for everybody--

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
through me, but to everybody--
that was all about creation

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and there was goodness
in the beginning.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
We brought it in with us, there
are beings who brought it in,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and we need to redo
the world with it.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the ancient teaching.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the creation
story of the Lakotas.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And really, every
creation story.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just can we remember
it, can we align with it,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
can we work through
our blocks, our fears?

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : I wonder if there was
such a separation when there

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
was all this spiritual
mysticism that we were raised--

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
or that humanity
was raised to it.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I don't believe so.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : But then scientists
came in, and they needed

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.345 align:middle line:84%
to materialize it and put
it into a grounded format.

00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And then there
became this separation.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And science and spirituality
started to split.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the shamans are
doctors of the soul.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They used medicines,
they used herbs,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
but they also talked
to somebody soul.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.635 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And they
cleared the soul

00:15:41.635 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of what might be in the
way of letting it actualize

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.363 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : And the light body.

00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's the light body.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything's about
everything's here.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You can use physical
tools, you can

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.068 align:middle line:84%
use psychological tools,
you can use spiritual tools,

00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:53.985 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really matter.

00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It's all
the same thing.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's all the same thing.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's fascinating.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But why did the Bible say that
people used to live 800 years?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Because they were in connection.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to
be in connection.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't stop and
start and everything,

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
we didn't freeze the flow of
what nature had to give us

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
or what spirit might
have provided us.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
unblock a lot here.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Undo a lot.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Undo a lot.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Remember a lot.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So this picture
here is of you with a shaman,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
with one of the
beautiful shamans.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Where were you in this one?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I was in Peru.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I have been to Peru many times
to learn, to work with shamans,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and I have also led some
groups down to Peru.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And for me, when I'm there, it's
more in the Amazonian basin.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:90%
The land is alive to me.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is
about my connection to it,

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
but that particular shaman
grows all the medicinal plants

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:90%
of Peru on his land.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
And I can understand them.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I feel them-- like he tested me.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:84%
We went out, and he said,
what does this one do?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell him, and
I am not an herbalist.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember three things
and forget them right away

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:90%
whenever I study plants.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.387 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not that gal.

00:17:05.387 --> 00:17:06.187 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Oh really?

00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:07.593 align:middle line:90%
You-- so you just intuit it all?

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I intuit
it all and I say,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
well, this is really good
for cancers of the throat,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:90%
He goes well, you're right.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I can feel
what the plant is

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
saying, because
they believe there's

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:90%
a connection down there.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : What are you feeling?

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:22.815 align:middle line:90%
What are you hearing?

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know, it's
sort of like it comes in

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:90%
through my body.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.323 align:middle line:84%
I feel the energy waves
that they ride on--

00:17:29.323 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and you know, there
actually is research

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that plants have a neurology
very similar to ours.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
There's the equivalent
of hormones,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
processing of light-- veins,
absolutely, everything

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:90%
is in there.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like they send
me information their way.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It comes in my body
and my energy centers

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:84%
are able to decipher
it or translate it

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:90%
into words that I can say.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.167 align:middle line:90%
So my system translates it.

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : What about the insects?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they're part
of the plants, right?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.885 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Oh, they're very
much a part of the plants,

00:17:58.885 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and they talk too.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think insects are
brilliant, to be honest.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : They really
have a huge role.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They run half the world,
if you really want to know.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- I even-- at one time,
a butterfly talked to me.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
This was at my house,
this wasn't in Peru.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But it I was just sitting
there, and it wandered and sat

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
on my hand, and I said
oh, hi, butterfly--

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
out loud.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- obviously also
speaking butterflyese,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and it said I'm not a
butterfly-- you know,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
in that way of connecting.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And I said well, what are you?

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And in my interpretation
of its messages,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:90%
it said oh, I'm a Yakowitz.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:90%
We're very important.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, it
sounds rather Jewish.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of cool.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, no, no,
no, we bring messages.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We bring them to the
buds, we pick them up,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and we know what
everybody's doing,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:90%
because we deliver messages.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
we know very much

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
from science what
is really happening

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.733 align:middle line:90%
in the natural kingdom.

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : OK, for those
watching right now that think

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.475 align:middle line:90%
you're just absolutely nuts--

00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I could be!

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Let's teach.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's teach.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So we saw a bunny the other
day, and we both stopped

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and we looked at the
bunny-- everybody does it.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to
talk to the animals.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right!

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.418 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Everyone does.

00:19:18.418 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So how can you introduce that?

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the bunny
was obviously just

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:90%
stayed there and stared at us.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Most bunnies
would have left

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And it has a
message, and it's not going

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to be speaking English, right?

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Nope.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: All right.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : But we don't
want to hurt the bunny!

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No!

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to scare
it, or anything like that.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So the technique that works
for me all the time is I always

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:90%
affirm my spirit.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:84%
That's myself that's
connected, through the creation

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
light is connected to
everything and everyone.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:10%
It just makes me a good--

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:10%
it puts me in my good
self is what that does.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I affirm the bunny's
spirit, all right,

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
because it has an immortal self.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe any of the
guidances that are around,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and then whatever
word you want to use--

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I always turn the process
over to the greater spirit.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the oneness
that can tell me

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
what that bunny
needs to communicate,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:90%
wants to communicate, et cetera.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So the translating is done
through higher forms than just

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
me in my head trying to figure
out what the bunny means when

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:90%
it's twitching its whiskers.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It just-- I don't know.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Right

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.025 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So I use that
process for everything.

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing healing
work with people,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:84%
client work, when I want to
know what to do during the day.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of the morning,
I just say spirit to spirit,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:90%
bring me what I need.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like everything
is going to be metaphysical.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It can just be Cyndi, you
really need to clean your house.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And you'll feel it.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll just know,
I've gone so far.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But you'll sense
the bunny's message.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
With those kind of beings
it's more of a feeling

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that you then have
to translate if you

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:90%
want to put it into words.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Well on a more
global scale, there's--

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --so there's a big
problem with these wildfires

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And because it's so dry
and because there are so many

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
trees in forest thick areas,
there's a movement to thin

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:90%
the forests.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And it's
a big controversy.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And apparently this
was done in the Native American

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
times, when the forest was
so thick when the trees would

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.668 align:middle line:84%
ignite they would burn so much
further because they could jump

00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
from tree to tree faster.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.785 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So now
they're talking--

00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and they're clear cutting.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So many of these trees,
and they're devastating forests

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that are natural
habitats for animals,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
controversial issue.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.793 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Because we don't
want to burn California,

00:21:36.793 --> 00:21:39.025 align:middle line:84%
but we also want to
provide this habitat.

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're very connected
to the trees, right?

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : If you were to intuit
the trees in California--

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I would say thin,
but do it very particularly,

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and get permission first.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'd bring a shaman
in to ask what sections,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:90%
which trees.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Give them enough time to give
up their soul or their spirit

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
if they're going
to be thinned out.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Give them the time, that's
how the native worked

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:90%
with the animals.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They just said,
look, we understand

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that we need to take flesh
here to support ourselves.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And they would do
ceremony before

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
so the animals that were self
selected or spirits selected

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.333 align:middle line:84%
would have time to send
their soul wherever

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
their souls are going to go.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.878 align:middle line:90%
You know, to the other planes.

00:22:22.878 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Or reincarnate,
or whatever.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
In the East, they
tend to do this more.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Even when they build a hotel,
they bring in a master,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
a shaman, an expert
to just say if we're

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
going to clear this land,
let's prepare the land.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's give it time to clean
the living and the ancestors

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of the trees
before we take this over.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Iceland they
believe in gnomes and trolls,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and when somebody has a sighting
or an experience with an elf

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:84%
or a gnome or a troll,
they'll stack stones.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Oh, really?

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, they will.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's something
like 47% 57% of all people

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
there believe in
the Elven kingdom.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.332 align:middle line:84%
And so if there is a
lot of stones in an area

00:23:12.332 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and the highway
department wants to build

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.153 align:middle line:84%
a highway through
there, they won't do it.

00:23:16.153 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:90%
They just won't do it.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Oh, that's
a good system.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They'll say this
is where the elves live.

00:23:19.872 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know we sound kind
of goofy, I do know that.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : I'm always
calibrating for that.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But you know, if you
look at the incredible miracles

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
shamans are often
able to perform--

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Right.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --and how often
normal people get dreams,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
senses, messages, how many kids
know things that they're not

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.725 align:middle line:90%
supposed to know.

00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:41.683 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Right, there's
a lot of studies there.

00:23:41.683 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: How we relate
to our own pets,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.683 align:middle line:90%
and we just know what they need.

00:23:44.683 --> 00:23:45.517 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Absolutely.

00:23:45.517 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And we can understand
what their barks or their meows

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
mean.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And we can
connect with them.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We're connected.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
We're connected.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not really so odd.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't care, people go
around talking to fairies,

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, but you
may want to talk

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to a guidance that could help
you or your own inner guidance.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Yes, and that's the
best way to do it and to learn.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And so you do.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You take people on
experiences, and you

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
get to point these things out.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.205 align:middle line:84%
I see those little
rock stacks a lot.

00:24:12.205 --> 00:24:13.005 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:15.338 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : They mean different
things to different people,

00:24:15.338 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but what it does symbolize is
someone there had a ritual.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Someone there had a symbol
they wanted to share.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.038 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And it connects
us in a different way.

00:24:24.038 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Exactly, and
where to find our own.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether that be the
religion we grew up in

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and we honor the rituals
there, because isn't

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
a religion about a
connection to a higher being?

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the religion,
to spirits, to saints,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:90%
to whatever.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
We honor where we grew up and
what we were raised to believe,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need to dishonor
any other ways or paths either.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Or we find our own depending
on our unique personality

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:90%
as we go through life.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
My youngest son uses
the word the universe.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
My oldest son is like I
don't know what's there, mom.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
He's just very
practical, but he's

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
dialed in like
nobody's business.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:90%
He's so dialed in!

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
He knows what people are
thinking and feeling,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
he's a wordsmith, so do
I care if he has a way?

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:90%
He is his way.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's a good person, and
he's a good soul That's a way.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.847 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And he's a
teenager or a young man,

00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and he's working through
the world with this level

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:90%
of intuition.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.237 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: He's making a
difference in the world.

00:25:25.237 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : So this is great.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, you took your son
to this beautiful place

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:90%
in Morocco.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I did.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : The camels,
that's beautiful.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That particular
son is about 30--

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
isn't that great?

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I
have a 30-year-old.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Soon I'll have a 40-year-old.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
No, he's 30, his girlfriend
is an amazing human being.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
They had been to
Morocco for a wedding

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
but never got to
the desert, so I

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
decided to take them as a
gift, kind of post Christmas

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:90%
gift to the desert.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:90%
But I've been to Morocco before.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
years ago was

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
one of those sort
of tipsy different,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, those unusual
metaphysical experiences.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to a girlfriend
and we wanted to travel,

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and she said well,
just ask your guidance

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
where we're supposed to go.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said Morocco.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.483 align:middle line:84%
I don't even really
know where it was.

00:26:14.483 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I hate to admit that.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But I said Morocco,
that's like in Africa.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.520 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Africa!

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So we went there,
and the whole trip

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:84%
was literally just a
download of guidance

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:90%
that ended up being different.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:90%
But healers we met on the way--

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
different of the guides we
met, like Berber guides.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.003 align:middle line:84%
People who lived in the
desert, teaching us legends.

00:26:40.003 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So when you
go to the location,

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:90%
do you seek these people?

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I seek these people out.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.733 align:middle line:90%
Well, I sort of find them.

00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : How?

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I don't really
know, to be really honest.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Like honestly-- that particular
trip, we just showed up.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We went to Casablanca and
had no plans except we

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
were going to follow spirit.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon we're
hiring a Sudan man

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:90%
who knew about a rune--

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and another knew
about a library,

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and another knew how to
get us out to the Sahara.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
guide knew how

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to get us to a Berber
home-like place

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the desert.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And so it just sort of flowed.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And information comes in
for me, especially when

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm not at home.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
That information's just
the dogs need a walk.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
The dogs outweigh everybody.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, walk, dinner, that
1:00 in the afternoon.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Dinner!

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That's an
interesting point, though.

00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:30.867 align:middle line:90%
We do get so crowded--

00:27:30.867 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We do get crowded.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.762 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --by our
day to day stuff.

00:27:33.762 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Getting outside of
your environment

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:90%
was really important.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So a lot of
the guidance was just--

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
obviously with people who
lived there that came through,

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
but also different
stories of what

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
we like to call
Atlantis or Lemuria,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
or where do people
come from, off world.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, most cultures believe
they came from the stars.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Like I met a group
of Shipibo Indians--

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a group of
Indians down in Peru.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:90%
They make this beautiful cloth.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The design on it is their
path from the stars.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the designs.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.288 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Oh.

00:28:06.288 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Through history,
that's their design.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.747 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Their history.

00:28:08.747 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So the stories I was hearing
from the people in Morocco,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
like Berber people or Arabic
people or the Jewish people,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
but also through my guidance
really matched up, too.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do all that when I was
with my son and his girlfriend.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
We rode camels, we went
camping, we ate really well,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You can have all
kinds of experiences,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:90%
and they're all good.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : But spiritual
tourism is a really big thing.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's huge.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a great
idea to go to a place

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and not just participate
in the touristy--

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --attractions,
but really to go and learn

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and respect the culture.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And that's kind of
what this is a little about,

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
is how to do that, to
respect your own culture--

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : --and then others.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a great picture
of you in a cave here,

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:90%
and where's this?

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's Belize.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I went to Belize the first
time with a guy friend.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was another one of
those very not planned trips.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Wow, you
do a lot of these.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I like
doing it that way.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.538 align:middle line:84%
I'm not to bring
a group like that.

00:29:09.538 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be a little
crazy, all right.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
We ended up out in the
Cayo mountain region.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:84%
We were two of the first
people to go into a mountain.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.590 align:middle line:84%
We had to climb up the mountain
and go into the mountain,

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and there were these ladders
that the archaeologists had

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.473 align:middle line:84%
just put in, because there
was an ancient ceremonial site

00:29:30.473 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the mountain that

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
was still preserved for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It was like the spirits
were still there--

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:90%
of these people.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : But when you go into a
place like that you really have

00:29:41.385 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%
to respect it.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.255 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You have
to be honorable.

00:29:43.255 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't touch things,
you don't take things,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:90%
you know you don't disturb.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You ask if it's even OK for
you to tune into the place,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.695 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with those
who might still be lingering.

00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to get permission.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's responsible.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's good.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So then we
led a group down there

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to enable them to have the
same experience as well.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : What was it
that you experienced?

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know,
I kept seeing--

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm very visual, I'm
very clairvoyant,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
especially the first time.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing the
stories of the people.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing them
when they were alive

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and how they took care
of their children,

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and how they took
care of each other.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't all great
mystery, it was village.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:90%
It was community.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It was care, it was love.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
theme of the group,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:84%
like in what way are we
blocking out in our own lives

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and in what way can we create
that amongst ourselves.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that theme kind of grew
out of my first experience.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Everything is a lesson
when you go on traveling.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's a wisdom gathering.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you don't even
know what it's really

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
going to be, I don't
think, till you get there.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Well,
especially when you--

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, trust is a big issue.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.663 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
these places, you

00:30:53.663 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
have to use your
intuition whether

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.360 align:middle line:84%
or not to trust this guide
to take you somewhere--

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --and not to take
advantage of you and to be

00:30:59.610 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:90%
safe.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Do you ever teach
that and really how to tune

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
into that?

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're in
physical bodies,

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.600 align:middle line:10%
and you have to really
trust the teacher.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:10%
Like if you meet somebody
in another country

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:10%
and you want to learn from them.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I get a sense
inside of my body.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I stay in touch with
that flow, and I

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
go this is not the
place for me to be.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
This is not the place
for me to bring people,

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
this is not the
place to do this.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a healthy wariness.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : What do you
do in that situation?

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I ask for guidance.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
What do I do, where do
I go, how do I do this--

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
you know, how do we get away?

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.672 align:middle line:84%
Do you confront-- we have to do
this in everyday life, right?

00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:45.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Right,
that's why I'm asking.

00:31:45.255 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Do you confront?

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you just slip away?

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you throw a fit?

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
People like to think
that history repeats,

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and so we're programmed.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Every time we're in danger, some
of us yell, some of us hide,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:90%
some of us bargain.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the limbic system.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is we're
never in the same situation,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
so it's on us to be in the
moment, in a sense of a flow,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and go how do I deal
with this situation?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:90%
How am I to be with this?

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%
How do I respond to this?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And so that's
part of the practicality

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:90%
of connecting esoterically.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I love it.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.775 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what I
wanted you to talk about,

00:32:25.775 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:90%
was how to bring that both in.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.440 align:middle line:84%
You talk a lot about
the chakra system.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Do you use a practical
way to go through the chakras

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to use that protection,
or discover what's going

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:90%
on about yourself intuitively?

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I do, I do.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know the
chakras really well.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I've written too many
books about the chakras.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:90%
I know a lot about the chakras.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes on
an everyday basis

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
or when I'm working
with a client,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:84%
if something's just not
quite connecting or working,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say is there a
place I'm supposed to focus,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be led to
a specific chakra.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Like the security chakra, an
emotional one, or the heart

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
based one, or
whatever it might be.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Most of the time,
though, I know that the chakra

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:90%
system is a system.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a ladder, it's
a flow way, and so I

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
tend to work with
it all at once.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Like I'll ask for energy
to come from the ground

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to come all the way through me
and just clear me so that I can

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.180 align:middle line:90%
be really focused right now.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll ask for
energy from above if I

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.115 align:middle line:90%
feel like I'm too stuck.

00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm being too practical,
or too scared, or too--

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:84%
you know what I mean,
in the everyday, then

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask for energy
to come from above.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And I just trust.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to go to
the top to ask for help--

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
whatever word you use,
God, Allah, Spirit,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.885 align:middle line:90%
I like to go to the top.

00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:44.052 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Go right to source.

00:33:44.052 --> 00:33:45.594 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I don't need
to go low level.

00:33:45.594 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Not right now, go to source,
ask for what you need.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And so if I feel like I need the
energy to come in from the top,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll just bring that down
through my chakra system.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But you know the chakras
each create an auric layer,

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:90%
which is around our body.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:84%
We have meridians
that flow through us.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So most of us is just a
very complex, subtle body.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:90%
We're a subtle anatomy.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You don't have to
get caught up in the details.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It happens when
I'm sitting with you.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Our energy fields

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're connecting.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said we're
just oscillating

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.700 align:middle line:90%
fields of light and sound.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I believe that, yeah.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't that cool though?

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.602 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It's a way to
connect with people,

00:34:23.602 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and to-- the

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Or to heal.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : --or to listen.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Or to say no
thank you, because not

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:90%
everything's for us.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
actually some studies

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that are saying that you--

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.810 align:middle line:84%
there's some recent ones
that say you pass energy back

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and forth, we all know that.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But even say if somebody is
eating something healthy,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the healthy
minerals or vitamins

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:84%
passed through their
energy field to you.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.953 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like so then
I can eat junk food

00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and they can eat
the healthy food.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't quite work that way.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And it can be scary for
people, to think about how

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.670 align:middle line:90%
interconnected we are.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there really
are things that

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
aren't good for us, or people
that we don't want their fear.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.433 align:middle line:90%
We don't want their shame.

00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Their energy, yeah.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So we need to
be wise about this.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
being like woo, let

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:90%
me just be free for all.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a responsibility
to be who we are,

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:84%
which means we don't want
to be who somebody else is.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Right.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.822 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
find a way to ground

00:35:21.822 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and protect from
that energy as well.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Which we'll
talk about in a second.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.398 align:middle line:84%
But first, I want you
to take a look here

00:35:26.398 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:90%
at Cyndi working with somebody.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Now Toni, I'm going
to have you experiment

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.170 align:middle line:84%
between the backside
and the front side

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.675 align:middle line:90%
of your first chakra, OK?

00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:35.475 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: OK.

00:35:35.475 --> 00:35:36.275 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:35:36.275 --> 00:35:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to put my
hand on the backside.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Through here we're supposed
to receive divine energy.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That kind of energy that helps
us know that we are who we are,

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that creates our
personal identity.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really what
the first chakra is about.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.408 align:middle line:84%
It's where we get to
say I am that I am.

00:35:55.408 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I want
you to just breathe in

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.525 align:middle line:90%
through the backside.

00:35:58.525 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:84%
All right, just kind of
like how you are right now.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Not really focused too much
on anything that's going on,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and just get a sense of
how you feel down here.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Physically, this chakra's in
charge of our physical health.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So get a sense of
your physical health,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
the real raw
emotions of passion,

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs about security,
the spiritual sense that we're

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:90%
connected to the divine or not.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm just going
to focus on allowing

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%
you to receive through the
backside that divine flow.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:10%
That support that
says you're here,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:10%
and you're supposed to be here.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
And tell me how you feel.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Wow.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't that cool?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: I can really feel that!

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Now what would it be like
to go through life that way

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and feel that connected?

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Total awareness.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Awareness,
safety, security.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Now let's try that
with your adrenals.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going in the backside
of your adrenals.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: OK.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: All right, they
just are what they are.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.438 align:middle line:84%
We all have adrenal
burnout, that's

00:36:59.438 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of the modern way
of living, all righty.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to send
through that divine flow again,

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.380 align:middle line:84%
through the inner wheel
of the first chakra.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're focused
on what's supposed

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to come through you, through
the inner or spirit wheel,

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:90%
versus your programming.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:19.472 align:middle line:84%
All right, so give me a
sense now how you feel?

00:37:19.472 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Oh, grounded.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Grounded.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Yes.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.263 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, like you're here.

00:37:23.263 --> 00:37:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Like I'm here.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Very much so.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: All right.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think about
one of your life's stresses,

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately it impacts
us in the first chakra.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:84%
That's where we do that fight
or flight kind of stuff,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
or freeze, all right.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So think about a life stress.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: OK.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: All right.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.654 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you feel in
your body with that?

00:37:41.654 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Oh-- anxiety.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Kind of edgy, I can
kind of feel it.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going back to the core
of the back side, first chakra.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:84%
We're just throwing
divine flow through again

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.166 align:middle line:84%
while you think about
that tough stuff.

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's happening
for you right now?

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TONI: A real sense of
peace, security, balance.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TONI: Balance.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yeah, balance!

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
trying to achieve

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:90%
through the first chakra.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are
healthier if we're

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
able to maintain that state.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important
to work with the inner wheel,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
from the outside to the in,
work through the backside,

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and know what each
of these chakras do.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
This is where we achieve
stability and security.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That lady looked like
she had a wonderful healing

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:84%
there, and she really
felt it emotionally.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love working with
clients and students

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:84%
when I know that I've
made a difference,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:84%
or I should really say that
I've been able to difference.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
really the healer.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from inside of
them or what the need comes

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.965 align:middle line:90%
to them, to be really honest.

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I like that.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.257 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know,
there's a shift.

00:38:57.257 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
You can feel something
physically or emotionally.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
That's when we know
that something's really

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
moving and going to make
a difference in our lives.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So you
empower the person to--

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : --do their own healing.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : You're a guide.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I'm a guide.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm the caring person.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think so often
what's stuck inside of us?

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be an
emotional issue,

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:84%
which they frequently of course
turn into physical issues.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a part of us that just
hasn't had any attention.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when we were growing up
we were ignored or we were hurt

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
or we were hit or whatever it
might be, or even as an adult.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, we need
to be cared about in order

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to let the healing energy open
from inside or to come to us.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So part of my role is really
just to care about the person

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and who they are and what
they've gone through.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.735 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Well, there's
so many things though,

00:39:50.735 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
you just mentioned, where
someone has gone through

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
a severe amount of
trauma and or abuse,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.473 align:middle line:90%
and it is stored in the cells.

00:39:58.473 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It is
stored in the cells.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It takes a while
for that to start to release,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's got to be
around a caring person.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It absolutely does,
and it locks into the body.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Our body is designed
to go into shock when

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.480 align:middle line:90%
we're going through a trauma.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it does.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The thalamus actually opens
up, puts the body into shock,

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:90%
so we can cope.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can lift the
car, help the person,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
or do something about the
event that put us into trauma.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But unless that's processed
through, that part of us

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:90%
remains in shock.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And so literally there's
a chemical cascade

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in the body, where the
receptors in the cells

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
sort of put the worst
of the biochemistry

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the cell.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.460 align:middle line:84%
They're called GABA receptors,
and we shut the trauma

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:90%
in the cells.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And the trauma gets
stuck in what's

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:90%
called the infralow brain wave.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It's under delta, it's
really, really slow,

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and it stores our trauma.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It stores our traumatic stress.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have traumatic
stress syndrome.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And until we feel safe enough
or somebody cares enough or can

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
sense what's locked
in there, we're

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.170 align:middle line:84%
not going to open up and allow
the chemistry in the body

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can get out of shock-- we
can be in shock for 40 years.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Around an event.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : For sure.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And if somebody doesn't
come along or something--

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because it can be a
spirit in a dream, or a friend,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:90%
or a dog--

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.437 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Or a teacher.

00:41:31.437 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: --or a teacher.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But we'll remain there, and the
rest of our life keeps going.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But the part of us stuck in
shock stays stuck in shock.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So it's very
slow, it's very low.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.327 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It can be very slow.

00:41:41.327 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:90%
It's locked, and dense.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It's in the
biochemistry, and it's

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.720 align:middle line:84%
in the very slow cortical
movements in the body.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So this is how
it manifests into disease,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's undetectable
for the most part.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And this is this what
triggers this massive epidemic

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmune disorders?

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, absolutely.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:84%
World Health Organization
says there's at least

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:90%
88 autoimmune diseases.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I think everything's
an autoimmune disease

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:84%
by the time you're done,
including mental illnesses.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, anorexia--

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're starting to see
that almost everything is about

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.570 align:middle line:90%
stress slash inflammation.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And most of that
starts with trauma.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I describe trauma as
forces that hit our body--

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
our physical or subtle body--
from the outside to the in.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It can be verbal
abuse, emotional abuse,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
physical abuse, we can be around
something really enormously

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:90%
challenging.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.052 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to be the
one who's being traumatized.

00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Like this
intuitive child.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's energy.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : You pick it at all up.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.138 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You pick it up.

00:42:47.138 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all forces.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It's forces that enter the
body and they get stuck.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Wherever these forces that carry
negative charges or charges

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:84%
that don't suit us get
stuck in the system,

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:84%
we will eventually
have a problem.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a block.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.002 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a problem,
we'll have a disease.

00:43:03.002 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : What about women
and thyroid disease?

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, yeah.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And not having
a voice For so long.

00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's all about voice.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we just, for a minute,
segue to the subtle system,

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid is in what we
call the fifth chakra, which

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:90%
is communication.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Which is about receiving
guidance and saying

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:90%
what it is we need.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Saying yes, saying no, and
being appropriately supported

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to do that.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a lot of words
we never got to express

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:90%
or emotions, that's energy.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
That is actual
biochemical energy.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Feelings are energy.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Feelings could be related
to its biochemistry.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.890 align:middle line:84%
If we don't say them,
they get stuck right here.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Or in the
case of many women,

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.015 align:middle line:90%
we were told not to speak.

00:43:51.015 --> 00:43:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Your opinion
doesn't matter.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And it
gets stuck in here.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : You can't vote.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Those opinions
are all in there,

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and they get stuck
in the thyroid

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.240 align:middle line:90%
or in that part of the body.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:84%
They can cause thyroid problems,
they can go hyperthyroid--

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:84%
if you feel like you have to
constantly please other people

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and just say what
they want you to say.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Hypothyroid tends
to be where you just

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:90%
start to shut down to yourself.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So what's the point
of speaking, what's

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.290 align:middle line:90%
the point of going there.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And some of those are actually
what I call psychic disorders.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Like if you have a lot of
guidance coming in, knowingly

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:84%
or not knowingly,
so much, you're

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:84%
picking up so much of
the invisible realm,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.820 align:middle line:90%
that you're overwhelmed--

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.700 align:middle line:84%
hyperthyroidism,
or you shut down

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to let
all that in-- hypothyroidism.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you start to crack the
code of the subtle world,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.680 align:middle line:90%
you can really understand.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The subtle and the
physical realms

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
are one and the
same in the body.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything affects everything.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.507 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And understanding
is one thing,

00:44:54.507 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:84%
but then actually healing
it, curing it in your body.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : There's a huge backlash

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Me Too is all about this.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: All about women's
speaking and being heard.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Or hopefully being heard.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Right.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean, there's a
questioning around that.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You know, too.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.270 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Women are standing
up and being heard,

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.750 align:middle line:84%
you know and I hope
that what's understood

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is that in the healing
of the feminine,

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:84%
we're healing not only
the feminine body, that's

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
going to embolden and help
our children be who they are,

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:90%
but it's healing men, too.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's healing the
feminine in men,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
it's enabling them to be
able to say, wait a minute,

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I have a voice.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I get to have my feelings.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.078 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know, an
interesting backlash

00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:84%
in my own home in
a positive way is

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:84%
my 19 year old was
struggling over the summer

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
because a young girl
was interested in him,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and he just had to
shut down to her.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of scary, like who
she was and what she was about.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So he said mom, I'm blocking
her, but it's really scary.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.850 align:middle line:84%
She could just go make
things up about me.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.590 align:middle line:90%
She could just say things.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of like we
have deeper questions that

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:90%
are going to come up now.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be about
how do we respect each other?

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we know how, no
matter what your gender is,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:84%
how to listen to the other
person and respect their yeses

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and respect their nos, and say
your nos and say your yeses.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
transformative right now.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Social media can also
be very invasive.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, yeah.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I have mixed feelings about it.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I think most of us do.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It connects
us, but there's many,

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.392 align:middle line:90%
many ways that we abuse it.

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well,
especially the young.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.058 align:middle line:90%
The young are so vulnerable--

00:46:38.058 --> 00:46:39.517 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : They don't
know enough yet

00:46:39.517 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --to others'
opinions of them.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's the
energy of it, too.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Like if one person posts
something negative,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.650 align:middle line:84%
how come we feel that
more than the positives?

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
There are science
studies that say

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to have five positives
to cancel out a negative.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes!

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:90%

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.732 align:middle line:84%

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:90%
We will.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Or they
can help themselves,

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.795 align:middle line:90%
literally just by knowing that--

00:47:14.795 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%

>>DALE: They don't.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.687 align:middle line:84%

yeah, a seeking

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.050 align:middle line:84%
of how to figure out who you are

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:90%
into the community.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, I
think our junior highs

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.450 align:middle line:90%
are sort of a mess.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't see a lot of guidance.

>>LISA : We've lost a lot of
ritual, a lot of ceremony.

Even in the Jewish
communities, they

00:47:55.877 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:84%
had the bar mitzvahs
and bat mitzvahs,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot about
tradition and ritual.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, it is.

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:02.988 align:middle line:10%

00:48:02.988 --> 00:48:04.030 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: That's very true.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : It gets crazy.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.460 align:middle line:90%

all and the social
part of it all,

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
but there's got to be an
emphasis on listening to that

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.980 align:middle line:84%
internal voice, which at some
point screams at you if you

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.015 align:middle line:90%
deny it for too long.

or an accident--

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: An addition, an

Now a lot of the kids
I meet in my practice,

>>LISA : It's amazing
that kids come to you.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, I love it.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I love working
with young people.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And because of what I do for
a living, intuition, energy

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:84%
medicine, I'm going
to get the kids that

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.630 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit
more aware of that

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:90%
or want to talk about that.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Nice!

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah!

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That you bring that
out, and give them space.

00:48:55.435 --> 00:48:57.185 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And one of the
things I love doing

00:48:57.185 --> 00:48:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is helping them figure
out their gifts.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:84%
What are you good at, what
is your learning style,

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.160 align:middle line:90%
how can you study for tests?

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.310 align:middle line:84%
How can you be really
good on the soccer field?

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:84%
How do you not pick up
everybody else's anxieties?

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're taking a
test, because you're

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:84%
sensitive and just stay in
your bubble and your moment?

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.297 align:middle line:84%
So those are really
important tools.

00:49:19.297 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Do you give them tools?

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.883 align:middle line:90%
That's the job, is tools.

00:49:23.883 --> 00:49:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Simple tools that their friends
don't have to know they're

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.460 align:middle line:84%
using, so they don't
need to be embarrassed.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.785 align:middle line:90%
They're quiet, they're silent.

00:49:29.785 --> 00:49:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Just give
us a couple of them.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.492 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Because adults
can use these, too.

00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, one
is the hara line.

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:43.190 align:middle line:84%
H-A-R-A. That's a Daoistic
thought, an energy body.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a gold line that comes
from the heaven-- it's really

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a beam of light that comes from
the heaven through the self

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:50.930 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the earth.

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're vertical
connection point.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I teach, especially
young people,

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:84%
not just to have the
team be like a pinprick,

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:03.080 align:middle line:84%
like a thin line, but expand
it beyond them so they're

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:90%
in this complete spotlight.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And what's outside of
it that doesn't suit

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:90%
them doesn't get to come in.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And within this they get
to be all that they are.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They get to ask for guidance,
they get to take a test

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and remember what
they've already learned.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.790 align:middle line:84%
For my son, you get to
go out on the baseball

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:90%
field as a pitcher.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean, and be
dialed in, but not notice,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:30.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, not care who's falling
apart or who's hitting the ball

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:31.987 align:middle line:90%
and who's not.

00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you a
sense of connection,

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.210 align:middle line:90%
but also individuality.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Now, for adults, where
many adults have financial

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.530 align:middle line:90%
fears, financial issues.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : What's a good tool for
adults that are dealing with

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.070 align:middle line:90%
that level of fear?

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, right.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.735 align:middle line:90%
And I can see why we would.

00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Use the hara line,
get interconnected.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
really substantial

00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:00.380 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about
house, money, clothing, jobs,

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.240 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about the lower part

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:84%
of the body and the energies
that the low part of the body

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.620 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So low part of the body
is anything really real

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and practical and everyday.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Middle part of the
body is psychological.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Top part of the
body is spiritual.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work with
the low part of the body.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Start to visualize
white light going

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.090 align:middle line:84%
through the low
part of the body,

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're working
through survival issues,

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:29.930 align:middle line:84%
family fears,
ancestral issues, ask

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.140 align:middle line:84%
for help from whatever you
call the greater spirit.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to clean the
lower part of your body.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.310 align:middle line:84%
You can ask that
spirit to help you.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
words you use, just

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.038 align:middle line:84%
say I don't want to
hold onto this anymore.

00:51:41.038 --> 00:51:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in the
flow of money, which is

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.710 align:middle line:90%
in the flow of matter, right.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It's what matters
as a human being.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So just ask to be
cleansed, ask for what

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.390 align:middle line:84%
you need to be brought to
you, and then walk around

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.860 align:middle line:90%
with your heart open.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.240 align:middle line:90%
In a good way, right.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Like you said earlier,
make it super obvious what I

00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:90%
need.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Super obvious,
show me what I need to do,

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.180 align:middle line:90%
give me money.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Give me signs.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I love really real things.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I always say to my
guidance, you know,

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:84%
just give me signs that I'm
on the way that is happening.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I did that one time around
money, and within one day--

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I was really-- a single
mom and just divorced.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, I found a
carpet sitting out

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.660 align:middle line:84%
on somebody's lawn that was
exactly the color that I

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.990 align:middle line:90%
needed for my new apartment.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.470 align:middle line:90%
I found a desk.

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I found $20 just sitting there.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything that
happened that day was practical.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:37.285 align:middle line:84%
Lower body asked to have
it manifested for you.

00:52:37.285 --> 00:52:39.035 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That asking
part is a huge piece.

00:52:39.035 --> 00:52:39.835 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Ask.

00:52:39.835 --> 00:52:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Ask and you shall receive.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not receiving,
ask to be cleaned,

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll be receiving.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Asked to be cleansed.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Ask to
be cleansed first.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.657 align:middle line:84%
One of your favorite
techniques is

00:52:48.657 --> 00:52:50.010 align:middle line:90%
the spirit to spirit exercise.

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : We're going to take a
look here at you doing a spirit

00:52:53.435 --> 00:52:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to spirit exercise
with someone else.

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: This is Wendy,
a good friend of mine,

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:10%
a hospice worker, and an
energy worker herself.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.550 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to
show you, via Wendy,

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:10%
how I work with
somebody else using

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.912 align:middle line:10%
the spirit to spirit technique.

00:53:08.912 --> 00:53:09.870 align:middle line:10%
So you're ready, Wendy?

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:10.400 align:middle line:10%
>>WENDY: Yes.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.300 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: All right.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to work
heart to heart,

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.380 align:middle line:10%
and demonstrate
this, and then ask

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.100 align:middle line:10%
you to share how you feel
when I do the different steps.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:10%
>>WENDY: OK.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: The first step
is always to affirm

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:10%
your own inner spirit.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.610 align:middle line:10%
And I usually do
this by breathing

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.890 align:middle line:10%
in to the center of my heart.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:10%
Just taking a
moment and affirming

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:34.810 align:middle line:10%
that I really am the divine
light that I've always been.

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.700 align:middle line:10%
And this allows me the
protective qualities

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:10%
that I need in order to
interact with somebody else,

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.630 align:middle line:10%
and it separates me in a
good way, in a healthy way,

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:45.870 align:middle line:10%
from that person.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.270 align:middle line:10%
So if I'm working with
them professionally,

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to reflect back to
them necessarily just what they

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:54.650 align:middle line:10%
want to hear, but what
the higher spirit wants

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:10%
me to be able to share.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.260 align:middle line:10%
The second step is to affirm
the spirit of the other person.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.560 align:middle line:10%
And I usually focus
on their heart.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.200 align:middle line:10%
I may actually, if
doing hands on healing,

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.747 align:middle line:10%
ask if I can put my
hand on their heart.

00:54:08.747 --> 00:54:09.830 align:middle line:10%
Would that be OK with you?

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WENDY: Yes, absolutely.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA : All right.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And then I ask you to just
affirm your own spirit,

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:10%
and just breathe
into your heart.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I'm sitting
across from somebody,

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.910 align:middle line:10%
or let's say I'm
teaching in a class

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:10%
and I don't want to tell
people affirm your spirit,

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:31.130 align:middle line:10%
I just simply affirm their
spirit inside of myself.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:35.080 align:middle line:10%
So no words ever
need to be said.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.080 align:middle line:10%
How do you feel, Wendy?

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.110 align:middle line:10%
However as I'm doing this,
affirming the greater self

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.350 align:middle line:10%
that you are.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.725 align:middle line:10%
>>WENDY: I feel returned to
who I am, it feels wonderful.

00:54:42.725 --> 00:54:44.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:10%
And actually, a
healing has already

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:49.010 align:middle line:10%
been performed at this point.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Now if I want to
continue, if I want

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.950 align:middle line:10%
to now provide information,
if I want to teach a class

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.530 align:middle line:10%
and have the right
information flow through me,

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:01.130 align:middle line:10%
if I want to open to healing
or healing information,

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:10%
I now ask for the presence
of the greater spirit

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.550 align:middle line:10%
to be made known profoundly
to me and to the other person.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And again, I don't
need to say anything.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.910 align:middle line:10%
I may do that if I
want, as I do now.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:10%
I now acknowledge the
presence of the greater

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.560 align:middle line:10%
spirit and the Holy Spirits.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:10%
She's tearing up.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.770 align:middle line:10%
How do you feel?

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.430 align:middle line:10%
>>WENDY: It feels precious.

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:25.290 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.790 align:middle line:10%
Usually people feel this.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Again, you may just be
at the grocery store

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and affirming that
the Holy Spirit is

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:34.800 align:middle line:10%
present to you and all others.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:10%
It's at this point, if I'm
working professionally,

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.890 align:middle line:10%
whether as I do as an
energy worker, an intuitive

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:44.130 align:middle line:10%
consultant, or let's say you're
a chiropractor or a school

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.530 align:middle line:10%
teacher, or you're
a mom or a dad

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and now you need to get
a message across or bring

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:10%
the message in, or
perform healing work,

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:56.400 align:middle line:10%
you now just enable the greater
spirit to work through you.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And it's from that place you
share energy, information,

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and hope.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So in that exercise you were
communicating with her spirit.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Can we do
that with everyone?

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.268 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, we could
do that with everybody--

00:56:13.268 --> 00:56:14.880 align:middle line:90%
if they're permitting it.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Oh, great point.

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.523 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: The beauty
of spirit to spirit

00:56:17.523 --> 00:56:23.600 align:middle line:84%
is we don't override somebody
else's highest need or desire.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So say I'm working
with a client.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I affirm my spirit, their
spirit, helping spirits,

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and the greater spirit.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.900 align:middle line:84%
What healing is going
to be delivered to them,

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.310 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to be shown
clairvoyantly or clairaudiently

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or practically to
say to them, it's

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.850 align:middle line:84%
certainly going to be
dictated by the greater spirit

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.840 align:middle line:84%
but also by what
their spirit says

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.530 align:middle line:84%
or communicates is
supposed to be done.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We need boundaries.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a right to
just barrel in on somebody,

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.340 align:middle line:84%
or even, say, you
shall be healed of this

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:03.490 align:middle line:84%
just because I as the loving
companion or friend or healer

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:04.955 align:middle line:90%
want them to be healed.

00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:06.580 align:middle line:84%
If their spirit is
like no, I have more

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to gain from this particular
experiment in disease,

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.450 align:middle line:90%
we can't barrel through.

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:15.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like
spirit to spirit.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not our agenda
that's going to count.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.612 align:middle line:84%
It may not even be the
agenda in their head

00:57:20.612 --> 00:57:21.820 align:middle line:90%
that's really going to count.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.362 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : So you're
just saying hello.

00:57:23.362 --> 00:57:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this for a second?

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, I'd love to.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That would
be really great.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.090 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to--

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to have you had to
share what you feel as I go

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.770 align:middle line:90%
through this exercise with you.

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: All right, so
I'm just going to start

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.640 align:middle line:90%
by affirming my spirit.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We always
start with ourselves.

00:57:37.545 --> 00:57:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You're the subject,
but I affirm my spirit.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of
feel that, can't you?

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:47.060 align:middle line:84%
That I just get really kind
of flowy and groundy and soft.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:47.860 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.547 align:middle line:90%
I affirm next your spirit.

00:57:51.547 --> 00:57:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That feels really good.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It's like saying hello to me.

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Now we're connected.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It's one on one.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : On a different level.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.548 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it kind?

00:58:01.548 --> 00:58:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : We've been
here, and this is here.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Now we're here.

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Now we're here.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Innate in that step, I affirm
the spirits who are present.

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That could be people
who are around us,

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.583 align:middle line:90%
or guides who are around.

00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't worry too
much about that,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.950 align:middle line:84%
but you can kind of get a sense
of an expansion between us

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and around us.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.350 align:middle line:90%
All right, perfect.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:25.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I just affirm or
acknowledge the presence

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.380 align:middle line:90%
of the greater spirit.

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
see how that feels.

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Wow, that's
very different.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.062 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, how
does that seem to you?

00:58:35.062 --> 00:58:37.270 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA : It's the difference
between on a map looking

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.700 align:middle line:10%
at a state versus
looking at the globe.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly, it's big.

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:43.052 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't that big?

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:43.852 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

00:58:43.852 --> 00:58:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And people
can get this confused

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:90%
with a religious movement.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.500 align:middle line:90%
There's a oneness.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a force that
is connecting us,

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.430 align:middle line:90%
that actually is now--

00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.560 align:middle line:84%
if we were to do
like a full session

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.060 align:middle line:84%
would tell me what
to say to you.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Might give me pictures about
you, might do the same for you.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Might even prompt you with
what questions to ask me.

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So you know what, let's
just go one more step.

00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's ask that greater
spirit to give you a sense,

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:17.680 align:middle line:84%
if there's anything you want
to ask for me to bring through.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.800 align:middle line:84%
A question, an insight,
doesn't matter what it is.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : About digestive issues.

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'm focusing on that.

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm staying connected
to the greater spirit.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go to my
personality, your personality,

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:36.040 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So immediately the
image that I'm getting--

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.450 align:middle line:90%
it's clairvoyant--

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:44.220 align:middle line:84%
like I see the yellow energy
of this part of your body,

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing kind
of a mass in there.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I would not call
it a physical mass,

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.580 align:middle line:84%
except that there is some
candida stuck in your system,

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and I hear that.

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm just hearing to say,
oh, you have some candida.

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.120 align:middle line:84%
It's yeast, it's
no big deal, it's

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.830 align:middle line:84%
where we actually store other
people's emotions, not our own.

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what we put in yeast.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of this
really nice caretaker,

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.420 align:middle line:84%
but other people's emotions,
historically, you sort of care

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.500 align:middle line:90%
took them.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So they started
going into your body.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Ah.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: All right?

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So you don't
want to do that anymore.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : No.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.820 align:middle line:90%
No it's a lot of work.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And we clear that
up out of the physical body

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
by helping to shift
that pattern for you.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Does that make sense?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:30.465 align:middle line:84%
You go through the spiritual,
the emotional, the energetic.

01:00:30.465 --> 01:00:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I get it all
at once, exactly.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Now to do the change process,
I use another process

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.100 align:middle line:90%
I call healing streams of grace.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- grace to
me is love in motion.

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And grace is available to all
of us the source, all the time.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not going to go mess
with your energy system.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm human, I don't
know what to do.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to screw up,
so I'm really now asking

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that greater spirit
or the source

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to send the forces or the
streams of grace to you

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
directly, that your spirit
wants to bring into your body

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
through your soul,
into your subtle body

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.090 align:middle line:90%
to make these shifts for you.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:13.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Nice.

01:01:13.905 --> 01:01:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: So it goes right to you.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not dependent on me.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : I love that,
that you do that.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't that great?

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yes.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.893 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally receiving
a healing right now.

01:01:20.893 --> 01:01:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : I love that.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I love that, thank you so much.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way
that you do that.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.310 align:middle line:90%
You back out of the way--

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : --and you allow
the guidance to come through

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.180 align:middle line:90%
for the person's highest good.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:31.890 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:32.360 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : That's wonderful.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I can actually feel
my stomach moving.

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I was going to say,
you can feel it now, can't you?

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:37.808 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And there's a
lot of heat in me-- yes!

01:01:37.808 --> 01:01:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.145 align:middle line:84%
People go-- well, I work
on the phone with people,

01:01:41.145 --> 01:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and they go well does
this work on the phone?

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.853 align:middle line:84%
It's like well, yes,
since I'm not doing it.

01:01:44.853 --> 01:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : It's all energy
and it's timeless.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's the gift
to you, and those

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
streams stay connected
to you long after we're

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.150 align:middle line:90%
done with our interaction.

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Nice.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.457 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They may tell you
drink some marshmallow tea--

01:01:58.457 --> 01:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
by the way, that's what
I'm hearing for you to do.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.082 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : I've never
even heard of it.

01:02:02.082 --> 01:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, it's not like
the little white marshmallows.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : No.

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Marshmallow root.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I know there's a Native
American marshmallow tea.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You may want to go
research what it does.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Sure.

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So sometimes I
just get practical things,

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.785 align:middle line:90%
but you may get them, too.

01:02:14.785 --> 01:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That sounds
delicious, though.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean, it
does really good.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.890 align:middle line:10%
I really like
smores, though, so I

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:22.530 align:middle line:10%
wish they would tell me
to just go eat smores.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.750 align:middle line:10%
Chocolate and marshmallows
and graham cracker, but--

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:26.550 align:middle line:10%
no.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.550 align:middle line:10%
I heard marshmallow tea.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : OK.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But see, even you
thinking it sounds good is

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.130 align:middle line:90%
probably your body--

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Completely.

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --saying hey, that might
help with the biochemistry.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : That is-- that's
exactly what I felt.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Like, wow,
that sounds really good.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I would go look it up.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a naturopath.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.410 align:middle line:10%
I'd go look up what it does.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:49.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA : I totally will.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Good, excellent.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : You're amazing,
thank you so much.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I had fun.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:53.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : You do!

01:02:53.995 --> 01:02:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I just have fun.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : You know,
I ask my guests,

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
what is your biggest why, your
biggest reason you do what you

01:02:58.890 --> 01:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
do?

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, it's just joy.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geek.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geek at heart.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I love studying, researching,
getting to know people.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it's
like something new--

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.950 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't need it to be new.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I learn a
little bit about something

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I just think it's about joy.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA : Yeah.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I do it
because it's happy.

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.742 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Well, I appreciate
the fact that you have such

01:03:23.742 --> 01:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
a grounded, practical
approach to healing.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You can teach us how
to do it, and also

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
show us that it's possible
for us to do it as well.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : Great gift,
thank you very much.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA : And thank you
so much for watching.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.700 align:middle line:10%
