>>LISA GARR: If you
believe in destiny,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:84%
you will love the
story of Susan Miller.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:10%
In 1995, Susan was one of the
original internet pioneers

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:10%
launching astrologyzone.com.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
And then in 2013, she created
the wildly popular app

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Daily Horoscopes--

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Astrology Zone, which I love.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And in 2016 alone, the app
generated 22 million sessions.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But the road has not always
been so smooth for Susan.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:84%
She was born with a
birth defect in her leg,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
which perplexed doctors.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:10%
And it was her mother, a
very talented astrologer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:10%
who taught Susan about
destiny and astrology.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And this knowledge
helped Susan enormously

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:90%
through her healing process.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.977 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SUSAN MILLER: Thank you.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for asking me on.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:10%

>>LISA: It's so wonderful.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And what you've done, I
mean, it's just incredible.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:90%
So take me back to Little Mom.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Ah, my mother.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
My mother did not want
to teach me astrology.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I had to keep begging her.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, she said a
little knowledge is dangerous.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And you see it on the internet.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.112 align:middle line:84%
The internet's great because all
this information is out there,

00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's not so great
because some people don't

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
know how to verify where they're
getting their information from.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now, yeah.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And my mother said,
you have to study 12 years

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.715 align:middle line:90%
or you won't be any good.

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to start
reading for your friends.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Well I said, Little Mom,
I don't have any friends.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I had been in the hospital
at age 14 for 11 months.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they had to paralyze
the leg from the knee down.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They tourniquetted
it so tight that I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:90%
had a drop foot and no feeling.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move it.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.855 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, we
didn't have a choice.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
We were either going to lose
you, or the leg, or both.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.399 align:middle line:90%
So we had to do this.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was the Chief of Staff
of the Hospital for Joint

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Diseases, and I loved him.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
OK, I mean, I'm here.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm still alive.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big decision.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.326 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I knew it was
going to be a big operation.

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:90%
No one else did, including him.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But they found out my veins
were made of tissue paper

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and would varnish
under pressure.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Pressure could be being
happy for Santa Claus coming,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
or being happy for my
birthday, or having surgery

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
is pressure on the body.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And he faced one of the
worst operations of his life.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was an orthopedic
surgeon, not a vascular cardio

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And yet, he was brilliant.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
He went to Oxford, and he
was a Fulbright scholar,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and, I mean, he just
had all those degrees.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:90%
He did figure it out.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, Susie, we
have to first straighten out

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
the circulatory
system, but then you're

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
going to go into three
years of therapy.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.939 align:middle line:84%
Every day, six hours a
day, five days a week.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:05.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As a teenager.

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:06.813 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: You're young.

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:90%
We're going to bring it back.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And I walked.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have crutches.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I always called my
crutches my chopsticks.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And I had a brace up to here.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.392 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
know if all that I

00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
was going to go
through-- because I

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.975 align:middle line:90%
had to give up high school.

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:10%
I went from junior
high to college--

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:10%
if that was going to work.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.377 align:middle line:84%
If all that effort had
a rainbow at the end.

00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And my mother wouldn't teach me.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:90%
She kept saying, no, no, no.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But she was reading
you the whole time, right?

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes And she had books.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So my sister would
take the books

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
off the shelf, put
them in my room

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:90%
under the dust ruffle of my bed.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I would read them,
and Jenna would come home,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and put them back on the shelf.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And my mother didn't know I
was studying all her textbooks.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one day she
walked into the living room.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I was writing a paper
on my typewriter.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, did you write
to "Horoscope" magazine.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how
does she know that?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, yes, but they
never answered me.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
She pulled out the envelope,
the latest issue and she said,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:90%
you're in this issue, Susan.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:90%
It has to be you.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It's your birthday, your time
of birth, your city of birth,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
your problem.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
This is you, isn't it?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yes.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.916 align:middle line:84%
Well, you wouldn't
teach me astrology,

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
so I needed a second opinion,
because you're always

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
so optimistic, Little Mom.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I wanted a second opinion.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what did the lady
say, the editor in chief?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
let's read it together.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you're asking a
question of an astrologer,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:90%
there's no definite yes or no.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You're putting pieces
of a puzzle together.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Great family support.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Good attitude of the patient.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Lives in a big city.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Access to great facilities.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter in the right
place to help her recover.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things like that.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said at
the end, we think

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:90%
you're going to walk again.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, Little Mom, what
do those astrological terms

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:90%
mean?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to teach me.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
She said, but you
already have your answer.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked
at her and I smiled.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh
no, you're going

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:90%
to check the editor in chief.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, of course.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.009 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: She said, you're
never going to stop asking.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, never.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:10%
12 years, you're not to read
one chart outside the family.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had a lot of
Italian relatives.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.645 align:middle line:90%
My mother was from German--

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.269 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you
had a lot of family.

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And German
has to be-- you know.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But all my aunts and
uncles lived upstairs.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, do me.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Do me.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And my mother would be there.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.261 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I will tell
you when you're ready.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to take 12 years
because you have to build up

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
all these synapses
in your brain,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
because you have to juggle eight
planets plus the sun and moon,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and then the transiting
ones, so you double that.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of math.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And I love geometry.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing that all day long.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And people say I'm psychic.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not at all.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:90%
God has a plan for us.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Obviously.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: We're systematically
rewarded and challenged

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
systematically to teach
us certain things.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But nobody, not
one astrologer ever

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.817 align:middle line:84%
met when they're
little says, I want

00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
to grow up and be an astrologer.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
I certainly didn't want to.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be accepted.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be in a normal job.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, but look at
the journey you went through,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:90%
and what an inspiration.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, it was
"Time Life" that came to me

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and said, write a column
for our website in 1995.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember that
taxi ride downtown.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was going
to change my life,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.724 align:middle line:90%
because when I was little--

00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to believe this--

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I sit, nine years old,
mommy, read my chart.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
you're going to write.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, write?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.921 align:middle line:84%
No one in our family
write for a living.

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to write and I'm
going to work on your grammar.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what
you're writing about.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that like what
a mom would say?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, when you
get to the end of your 30s,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
some newly invented
form of communication--

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
so new we don't know
the name of it yet--

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
it will change the
way you work and be

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the channel in which you make
your ultimate contribution

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.065 align:middle line:84%
I was thunderstruck,
because as little as five,

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:90%
I remember playing on--

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I might have been six--

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
playing blocks while my
sister slept in the crib,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because we're a
four-year difference.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's big blue eyes
coming close to me saying,

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
did you ever wonder why
you were born, Susan?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:90%
No, mommy.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.008 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, we all
need to think about that

00:07:28.008 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and we all need
to find an answer.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So my mother was
deeply philosophical.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.464 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm nine and she's
giving me a clue of where--

00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
remember all this.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.255 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: --that's
going to-- oh,

00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
it was like a choir of angels.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I have Aquarius on the
top of the mid-heaven,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%
where 12 is on the clock.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Aquarius
is what's invented next.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I drove her crazy.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
What could it be?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.908 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
a piece of paper.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, somehow
connected with electricity.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is getting
even more mysterious.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And you know how kids are.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.391 align:middle line:90%
They don't let up.

00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They don't stop, yeah.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So that
week, I kept it up.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
She said, look,
Aquarius is an air sign.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the little zigzags.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:90%
That's air.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
There's little
lines or dots that

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:84%
go through the air that's
invisible that's somehow

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.399 align:middle line:90%
associated with your writing.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She didn't know
about the internet.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:90%
There was no clue.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.049 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It wasn't even in
the paper or anything yet.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I was so little.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: I know.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I was born in little
house on the prairie time.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then how did
you get to starting it?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did it
all come together?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:90%
Well, you launched that in 1989.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, I was an agent
for commercial photographers.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love dealing
with creative people.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's my favorite thing
in the whole world.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had a photographer who
I had looked at 100 portfolios

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:90%
and I picked him.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
He did splashes, spills,
and pours so gracefully.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And he never said, we'll
fix it in the system.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:90%
He would fix it on film.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And I took the two creative
directors to lunch.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
They were from
Saatchi & Saatchi.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Scott said to me, my
wife would love you.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, I would love her.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:90%
What does she do?

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she's creative
director of Warner Books.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to go up
there and say hello to her.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, those were the days where
you still did call on people.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.375 align:middle line:84%
Not like now, that everything's
become so impersonal.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:22.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Text, yeah.

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:24.424 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I did go up there
and she'd give me galleys.

00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
She'd give me books.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:90%
She'd give me things.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And I would read her chart.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:90%
We would have fun.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I was an agent, you'd
go from agency to agency,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.526 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes you had
an hour in between.

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'd run up to the
Time Life building

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:90%
on 6th Avenue and 50th street.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And one day she said, I
have a feeling about you.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Someday, I'll get you a book.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, nice.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Now, it's
very hard for a person

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to see you in another
role usually in society.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Five years go by, nothing.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And I never mentioned it again.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was just
sweet for her to say that.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I walk
along the sidewalk, I'd say,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what would
have happened if I

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:90%
would have gotten that book.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Would my life have changed?

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
And one day she calls me.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's 1994 and she says, I
have good news and bad news.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me the good news.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I have your book.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:10%
I said, you meant it?

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:10%
It's just a little book.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is you've got
to write it really quickly.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
the website yet.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
So I said sure.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It's sold out and
then she said, I'm

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.965 align:middle line:90%
sending you to the webmaster.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
what happened.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I said,
what do they want?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And she said, they don't know.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad she said that.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And you really should
disagree with management

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
if you think their
direction is wrong.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.074 align:middle line:84%
If your listeners have anything
to take away, it's that.

00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them,
what would you like?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said something
short for women every day.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, this
isn't a girl thing.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Men love astrology.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And I will write
in a detailed way.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:90%
We must write long--

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
not short-- long for men
and women once a month.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.995 align:middle line:84%
They said, Susan, you're flying
in the face of web wisdom.

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be short,
no more than 500 words.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, that's
good for other people,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
but when it's about
the reader, then

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
you should give them
chock full of information.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's true.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.312 align:middle line:90%
I read every single word.

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I even
give them a summary.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I took notes.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And
summaries sometimes

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.911 align:middle line:90%
have things that are different.

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I write my summary
three months ahead.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, they are
different, aren't they?

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, I say
to myself, oh, I

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
didn't talk about
Scorpio's apartment,

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:90%
but I have nowhere to put it.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.514 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just leave it down here
as little bits of chocolate.

00:11:40.514 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I take notes
throughout the summary,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.471 align:middle line:84%
and then you have it
summarized, and then I

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:90%
put them into my calendar.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: That's so good.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, I sell a calendar.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see
that certain days are

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.267 align:middle line:90%
coming that are really good.

00:11:53.267 --> 00:11:54.683 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let me ask
you a question.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:90%
You've thought of it all.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But do you do this
based on astrology?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Mhm.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You do everything
based on the charts?

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Anything I say,
you can look up in a book.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:90%
That's very important to me.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I do give the provenance
of everything I say.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel almost like a lawyer has
to persuade you to believe me.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:90%
This is really good.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming back until 2026.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Please take this seriously.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll see how I really try to
present my case to the reader,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.405 align:middle line:84%
because in my mind, the
reader's saying, so what?

00:12:29.405 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Why should I listen to you?

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
So you know that.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: I'll tell you why.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.985 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to.

00:12:34.985 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
You have free will.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you do, you're
going to do really well.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you are
an accredited astrologer

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
by the International Society
of Astrological Research, which

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You went and did that
before or after college?

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: They test,
you that's all.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And they read your writing.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.315 align:middle line:90%
And it's like that.

00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But your idea into
the wisdom, so--

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: That was later.

00:12:57.995 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really tell people
I knew astrology for years.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Did you know
before my mother died--

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I would always come
over to her house.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.754 align:middle line:84%
She was right in
the neighborhood

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have to call.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:90%
She was always happy to see me.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So she's sitting in
her little chair,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.965 align:middle line:84%
like, Little Mom,
what are you reading?

00:13:14.965 --> 00:13:16.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why do you
call her Little Mom?

00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Well, she was so tiny.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:90%
She was teeny weeny.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:90%
She's 4 foot 11.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said, how tall
are you Mrs. [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
She said, I'm 5 foot 7.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%
He calls me up.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Was she ever 5 foot 7?

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
She just thinks of
herself that way.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.598 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Do not panic.

00:13:33.598 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
She was always little.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think at her tallest
stage, she was 5'' 1'.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But you shrink a
little bit as you get.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But she
was sitting, reading,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what
are you reading?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And I go behind her.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You're reading "Gemini's
Astrology Zone."

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But mom, you know
what's going to happen.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Why are you reading that?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And wait a minute, you
don't even have a computer.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
She said, your sister prints
it out for me every month.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.358 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I said,
why do you read it?

00:14:04.358 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, I want to
see what you're saying.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.392 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh.

00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it any good?

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: How am I doing?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And she goes like this
with a twinkle in her eyes.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
You can continue.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Validation

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And I gave her such a big kiss.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
No-- she-- tone,
attitude, spirit

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in the way you
convey information

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.195 align:middle line:90%
was just as important to her.

00:14:27.195 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And it is to me, too.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just innate.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
But I love that about her.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Once a prisoner wrote
to me from jail.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.285 align:middle line:84%
When I had just started,
he wrote to the publisher

00:14:37.285 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and I get the letter.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, a person
in jail wrote to me.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
She said, I hope
you're answering it.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, I am.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And her exact words was,
even that poor devil

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:90%
needs inspiration and hope.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And I loved her for that.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that why you do it?

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So I wrote the answer
and I gave it back to my editor

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
so I wouldn't have my
own address on there.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You do go
into great detail.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference,
I've always wondered about,

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic astrology
and what you do?

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, Vedic
is very different.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
It comes from India.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, to get a teeny bit
technical but not very,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
the Earth rotates
three different ways,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:90%
but most people think only two.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Day and night, summer,
fall, winter, spring.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
way it rotates,

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and I have to explain that.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagine our solar system
on a dinner plate.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's spinning, and spinning,
and spinning through space.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The whole solar system
on this dinner plate.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through
a retrograde motion.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So most of us were
born in the age

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of Pisces, the age of
cathedrals and religion.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Now it has moved retrograde
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Each age is 2,000,
2,200 years long.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It takes 26,000 years to go
all the way around and make

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:90%
a full rotation.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
We are in the Age
of Aquarius now.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The Vedics know and
we know that there's

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
precession of the equinox
where the constellations move

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:90%
one degree every 72 years.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And they make the correction
in their form of astrology.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Western astrology does
not make the correction,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's called
sidereal astrology.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:90%
It's right in my computer.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.387 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you what the
Vedic method would be for you.

00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:33.095 align:middle line:84%
But we have found with
Western astrology,

00:16:33.095 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't work if we
make the correction.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, it's
going to come back

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:90%
to where it was originally.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And there is no 13th sign.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that on my website.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's all connected to this
procession of the equinoxes,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
where things are moving.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
You do not get your personality
from the constellations.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:90%
You get them from the planets.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Think of the constellations as a
big tape measure that glitters,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.099 align:middle line:84%
and it's beautiful,
and its stars.

00:17:03.099 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I used to think constellations
were all over the globe.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
They're only within
that golden belt.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So these are, what you
are talking about more,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
are the personalities
of the sign.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes, but everything.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the predictions
of when you'll

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
have a really rewarding
time or a challenging time,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't work when
we make the correction.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
On any software program,
you can make it.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I could do it in two seconds.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.439 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: But it doesn't work.

00:17:32.439 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%
We've tried it.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
There's been white
papers written.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Western astrology does
not make the correction.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what happens
when you see something

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
bad in someone's chart, where
they're going to be going

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:90%
through a really rough time?

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell them?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah, I do.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I say, you've got
to watch that job.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It could be that that company
may be merging or laying people

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like letting your friend
go out, having lipstick,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:90%
like, all over her face.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not right.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You should tell them, but it's
so easy to overstate an aspect

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and make it sound
worse than it is.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that things
aren't usually in the extreme.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to rein yourself
in if you're an astrologer,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and not go overboard.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There's this middle
course you have to take.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Eclipses are the most dramatic.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.973 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about eclipses.

00:18:28.973 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, they
bring to the surface

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
things that are going on that
you had no idea were going on.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:90%
You can think of last summer.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
July 27th was a very
difficult eclipse.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But then there was a very
good one on August 10th.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you have
to give something up.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes say to myself,
OK, what is this eclipse going

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
to give to me?

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's going to ask for
a sacrificial lamb.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It's going to ask me
to give something up.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to give
me something, too.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.789 align:middle line:84%
Something ends and
something else begins.

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a good
way of looking at it.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.746 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: And you know what?

00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Until you can step back
and see the whole pattern,

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
you can't say if it was a
good eclipse or a bad eclipse.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:90%
You have to wait a little bit.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And you usually can
turn difficult things

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:90%
into positive things.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese say in every
reversal is opportunity.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's so true.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is a reversal
what the retrograde is?

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, no.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It just means
a setback or something

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:90%
very difficult happening.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.737 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is a
Mercury retrograde?

00:19:33.737 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that, because they
seem to wreak a lot of havoc.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It does, because
it happens so often,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:90%
every 12 weeks.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the
planet of intellect,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of communication,
negotiation, commerce, buying

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and selling, transportation,
shipping, customs,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.016 align:middle line:90%
the post office.

00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Sometimes you
hear of a letter coming

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:90%
from 1942 getting delivered.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's such a cute
story about Little Mercury.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Now, remember,
Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So those two are
affected the most.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So Little Mercury
wakes up in his cave.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, why are
we in a cave, Mama?

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
He talks from day
one, real speech.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
His mother is like, well,
had an affair with Zeus.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.862 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
talk about this.

00:20:25.862 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Shh.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And why are you talking at all?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:90%
You're an infant.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So the baby crawls
out of the bassinet.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Says, I'm not going
to live in this cave.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to be on Mount Olympus
with my brothers and sisters,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
even if they're not full
brothers and sisters.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:90%
So he steals Apollo's cattle.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And farmer is there.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you didn't see
me take this cattle here.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pay you.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
He's a clever,
street-smart baby.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And he makes the
cattle walk backward,

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Mercury retrograde
so that Apollo

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:90%
won't know where his cattle is.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And he takes one steer, and he
chops him up, and offers him

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:90%
to the gods.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
This is considered
very sophisticated.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The next day, he goes back to
make sure there's no clues.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:90%
He sees the same farmer.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But he's shapeshifted
and he said, did you

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.524 align:middle line:84%
see a baby stealing
Apollo's cattle?

00:21:17.524 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah,
he went that way.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I paid him off
I can't even trust him.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
So he turns him into stone.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So now by this time, Apollo's
noticed his cattle is missing

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and is looking everywhere.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he's following
the breadcrumbs, so to speak.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
He comes into the cave
with his great light.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The mother was just in awe
and doesn't know what to say.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And the baby makes
believe he's sleeping.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And Apollo says, I
know what you did.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The baby sits up
and argues with him.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:90%
What did you expect?

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at this place.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:90%
You live here?

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You live on Mount Olympus.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would want to live here!

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:90%
So he's amused by him.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm taking you to Zeus.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to do with you.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So he picks up the baby,
brings him up to Mount Olympus.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Zeus looks at the baby
and sees how smart he is.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
He also looks just like him,
so he can't really disavow him.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Zeus says, here's what
we're going to do.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
You will live up here.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And you speak so well,
you will speak for me.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:90%
You will always sit next to me.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you go 27 and
1/2 degrees away from me,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.704 align:middle line:90%
I will yank you right back.

00:22:24.704 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And you must stay
here, but I will

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
let you travel to Heaven,
to Earth, to Hades.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Every other planet had strict
rules on where they could go.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, being the travel
planet, could go anywhere.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:90%
But there is a price for this.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I need you.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%
You need to speak for me.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So whenever Mercury starts
wandering away, he says,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:90%
where are you?

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
that's what happens.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: You're coming back.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.146 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the planet
of Mercury wreaks havoc

00:22:50.146 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
and then it pulls us.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.478 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: When he's
retrograde, you

00:22:52.478 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
should never buy electronics.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
When you have
Mercury retrograde,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
you're usually
calling the repairman.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.422 align:middle line:84%
My dishwasher, which
was fairly new,

00:23:02.422 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
something went wrong
with it, and the man

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
came up, and said you
need a special part.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
My TV, which I don't even use
that much in that one room--

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
it's a guest room--

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:90%
conked out.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're not allowed to
buy a new electronic during.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
like, oh no, I have

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
to live like this for
another 2 and 1/2 weeks.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.256 align:middle line:84%
Mercury stays retrograde
for 3 and 1/2 weeks.

00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
eternity at the time.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: It does feel that way.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
If someone's listening and says,
wait a minute, I'm pregnant

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to have my
baby with Mercury retrograde,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:90%
not to worry.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.184 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was
going to say, yeah.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm born with
Mercury retrograde.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It makes a child
more philosophical

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.662 align:middle line:90%
because they think deeply.

00:23:40.662 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, we have
production that goes on

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:90%
during Mercury retrograde.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.361 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, it's tough.

00:23:44.361 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
TV and publishing.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Very difficult.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah there's
a lot of do-overs.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
tech not to upgrade

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the servers or the computers,
and they laugh at me.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Now they call me.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I tell lawyers, I'm
not signing contracts

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:90%
with Mercury retrograde.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They'll only have to
be renegotiated later.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you really
honestly live by it?

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, yeah, I'm a
person of integrity, sure.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you plan
everything based on this?

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Your schedule, your
lunches, everything?

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I kind of know
because I write a calendar.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So I know what the year
is going to be like.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, my daughter
was going to get married.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And she wanted a wonderful day.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.122 align:middle line:84%
And her boyfriend, who she was
living with at the time, Leo,

00:24:35.122 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and his friends were
saying, when are you

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.996 align:middle line:90%
and Christy getting married?

00:24:37.996 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to feel
bad I hadn't a day yet.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But I saw this one year was
very good in the beginning

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.724 align:middle line:84%
and very awful from June on
with too many retrogrades.

00:24:49.724 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to get married
with Venus retrograde.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Affection cools.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, with Mercury retrograde,
because it's a pact,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.341 align:middle line:84%
it's a promise, you
don't want that.

00:24:57.341 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
Mars retrograde either,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.923 align:middle line:84%
because then there'd
be no sex after awhile.

00:25:00.923 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:90%
It would be terrible.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't do that to her.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
through all this.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's an
interesting statistic.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Most brides marry within
six weeks of the birthday.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:90%
So I started with that.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I found an ideal day
very close to her birthday,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because it's the sun
conjuncts the sun.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%
It's coming together.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Most people marry the son
of their mother or father.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, Christy read
that and told me that.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's not true.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Said, mommy, you
married a Scorpio.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Grandpa is a Scorpio.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Great grandmother is a Scorpio.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh my gosh.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
It happened to me.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So I want everyone
to think about it.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And you say, why
does this happen?

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
familiar with the sign.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, and the negatives
and the positives of the sign.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: There's
a certain comfort.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, in your own
life, you use this, obviously,

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and you write a year ahead.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
a year ahead, 2019?

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, it's going to
be a more productive year

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.656 align:middle line:84%
than last year, because we
had all those retrogrades.

00:26:04.656 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say, well,
every planet retrogrades.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The outer planets,
when they retrograde,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
you don't feel them as strongly.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel them
as strongly as you

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
do Venus, Mercury,
and Mars, because they

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:90%
orbit close to Earth.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You can even see them
with the naked eye.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So you really don't want
to do big initiations

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:90%
when they're retrograde.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Next year, Venus and
Mars are perfect.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, little Mercury,
little Dennis the Menace,

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:90%
he's going to go back and forth.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But for all practical
purposes, it's

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:90%
a much more productive year.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The year before this was a
year of looking back a lot.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:10%
When the planet goes
retrograde, you're

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:10%
supposed to think
about what went wrong,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:10%
how can I fix it,
where am I vulnerable,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.894 align:middle line:10%
and make corrections.

00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
want to hear about that.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Let me forge forward.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are times in
our life we need to look back.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It's good for us.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:90%
So 2019 is more looking ahead.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Forward, mhm.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Progress?

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah, well, Jupiter's
in Sagittarius, which rules

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.335 align:middle line:90%
broadcasting and publishing.

00:27:21.335 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic for Gaia.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And both
industries have

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:90%
had to adjust to a digital age.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the golden
age of television,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
they're saying now, because
you have all these streaming

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.991 align:middle line:90%
videos--

00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:36.281 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like this network, yes.

00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: --and high production.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, they had
kittens on skateboards.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe people
used their time that way.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.173 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now we have this
great quality production.

00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
more and more that.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:90%
And then magazines have died.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I make my living in magazines.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I write for 10
different magazines.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is a suffering industry.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But with Jupiter and
Sagittarius, it just went in,

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and it will stay all
the way through 2019

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:90%
until the beginning of December.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very hopeful
placement for Jupiter.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It took 12 years to get there.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.809 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you're a Sagg,
it's the best thing ever.

00:28:13.809 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, what
does that mean?

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Jupiter's the
giver of gifts and luck.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Whatever he touches, it expands.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And it puts you at the right
place at the right time

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:90%
with the right idea.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.147 align:middle line:90%
And it's just magical.

00:28:27.147 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And you usually
travel a lot more if, say,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.297 align:middle line:84%
you're a Sagg, or a
Leo, or an Aries--

00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:84%
those are all the
fire signs-- they're

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:90%
going to benefit from this.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But then in December, Jupiter
will move into Capricorn,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and then the Earth signs
will get their turn.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn, Virgo, and
Taurus, but also the water

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
signs Pisces, and
Cancer, and Scorpio.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is an
equal opportunity employer,

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you should look
at the year ahead as one

00:28:57.045 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:90%
with gifts and luck.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:90%
I talk a lot about that.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But also, Saturn is
the great teacher.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.797 align:middle line:84%
So he challenges us,
and we have to learn.

00:29:07.797 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's life.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Life is full of challenges
so we can learn and grow.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I think people make too
much of the difficulties.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:90%
And you can face it.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.777 align:middle line:84%
And God doesn't give us anything
more than we can handle.

00:29:22.777 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I say that all the time.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:90%

And my children kept
saying, change is good.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I face a crisis,
which is all the time--

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep, for all of us.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.005 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: If you're
running a business,

00:29:35.005 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:90%
it's part of the territory.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're stretching
and growing,

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:90%
it's part of the territory.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have health
things, which I do,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
because I was born
with a health defect.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
I have to go in the hospital

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and get a tune-up.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I say going back to
the doll hospital.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also opens your
heart, and makes you

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to other
people, and more compassionate.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%
So it always has a good side.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But I remember my
children saying,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:84%
mommy you always
said change is good.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.586 align:middle line:90%
Change is good, mommy.

00:30:03.586 --> 00:30:05.355 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh
God, do say that?

00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But I have to find
the good in this.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.050 align:middle line:90%

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:90%
So does Google.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.356 align:middle line:84%

>>MILLER: But $1.25 a
week is less than a latte.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:90%

>>MILLER: It's August, 2016.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:01.114 align:middle line:84%
I'm Susan Miller, and

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We start with a
fabulous new moon

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
August 2nd in Leo, one of the
sweetest new moons of the year.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to
act and do things.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:90%
There are no retrograde planets.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:90%
This new moon sets the tone.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Then on the 13th,
Saturn goes direct.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It has been going
retrograde since March.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Saturn rules some of the most
important long-term plans

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
that we put in place.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
On the 18th, we have a
full moon in Aquarius.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We've got great aspects
surrounding this full moon.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.266 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

>>MILLER: Well, that
was the director.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get the best, and
he asked me how to describe you.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, Paul, I don't
know how I'd describe myself.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.040 align:middle line:90%
He said, Jackie Kennedy.

Are you kidding?

00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I'll spend my whole life

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:90%

You have no idea how
you're coming off in life.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:90%

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about eclipses.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
How do they impact
us and what should we

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.809 align:middle line:90%
do when there's an eclipse?

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well,
they're super strong.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to wait
until an eclipse has spoken.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I have, like, a
25-point little tip

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
sheet on the front
page of my website.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Go on the computer
so you can find it.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the lower left-hand side.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:90%
How to Deal with Eclipses.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Eclipses bring
things to the surface

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that you had no
idea were going on.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:90%
And it comes up like a geyser.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.546 align:middle line:90%
And it gives you truth.

00:33:03.546 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And they're non-negotiable.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:84%
If you lose your
job, or you break up

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
with your girlfriend
or your boyfriend,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:90%
don't beg to reverse it.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking
across a rickety bridge

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.550 align:middle line:90%
over a ravine that's very deep.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.655 align:middle line:90%
Don't look down.

00:33:21.655 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the other
side, the bridge falls away

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and there's no way back.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to accept the
finality of an eclipse.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And don't lose your
dignity and beg.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It never does, because the
whole idea of an eclipse

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:90%
is to push you forward.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:84%

significant events

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%

>>MILLER: Well, it would
be best not to get married

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:90%

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or break up.

00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: --or start a
business on an eclipse.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.714 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are you talking about
lunar eclipses, solar eclipses?

00:33:50.714 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Both.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.530 align:middle line:84%
In a typical year, we
have two lunar, two solar.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually in the coming
year, we have five.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
A lunar eclipse is
always a full moon.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:84%
A solar eclipse is
always a new moon.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:84%
But they're normal, new,
and full moons on steroids.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They're three times as strong
as a normal average one is.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And as an astrologer, I
look to those eclipses

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to see where the biggest
change is going to happen

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.010 align:middle line:90%
in someone's life that year.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, what
about astrology

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.439 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have anything to do with
freewill or your own choices

00:34:29.439 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:90%
in life?

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Tremendously, it
has to do with freewill.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:10%
I could tell you
it's a good time

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.580 align:middle line:10%
to start looking
for an apartment.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:10%
But if you say, I'm fine, I like
where I live, you can renovate.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:90%
You can pay.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:90%
You could do repairs.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
If you say, no, I don't
really have any money,

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.239 align:middle line:84%
then take a look out
in the flea markets.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.580 align:middle line:84%
You may get the
most beautiful desk

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
that you've been looking
for at a bargain price.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
You can update your
everyday dishes.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:84%
You can do things on a
little scale or big scale.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Also, when you have
a good house of home,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
you also get great
family support, too.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And your parents help you,
and give you great advice,

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and may even loan you
money if you need it.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So many
people may not ever

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:90%
look to astrology for answers.

>>MILLER: Oh, yeah,
you don't have to.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an evangelist.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But I feel it's
such an advantage

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.490 align:middle line:84%
to know where your
areas of strength are.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're also focused on
things that are frustrating us.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:84%
When all these things over here
are growing in your garden,

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.390 align:middle line:90%
pick that plum off the tree.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:90%
It's there for you.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Look at the whole 360.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I can show it to you.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you when to
act, when to hold back.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:90%
But in the end, it's up to you.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Reporters lately
have been saying,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is astrology popular because
no one believes in God anymore?

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, you just put a steel
blade through my heart.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I would never, ever
be in a discipline

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:90%
that was anti-religion.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Religion teaches us ethics,
how to treat each other,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
how to realize that there is
a force bigger than ourselves

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that has created
this beautiful world.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the chart, it shows
your feelings toward religion.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:90%
The ninth house is the dogma.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:90%
The 12th house is your belief.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
misconceptions out there.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And people say, don't tell me
I'm going to be hit by a truck.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're never
going to say that.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.544 align:middle line:90%
You're always so positive.

00:36:26.544 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: [LAUGHS] Well,
it's because Little Mom was

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:90%
so positive.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.571 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That helps

00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:32.955 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes.

00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
However, having said
that, big life events

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:90%
happen very near eclipses.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, It was funny, this
past couple of years,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I had an operation.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor picked June 12th.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.427 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, such a random day.

00:36:50.427 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a new moon.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a full moon.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And I had to get two doctors--

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I doubt he's looking.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.254 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, I know.

00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't looking.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized the
next month was July 12th,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and that was an eclipse.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So an eclipse can
affect you one month

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to the day early or one
month to the day later.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So when you
have a very big event,

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:84%
just scribble down on your
calendar the day it happened.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You won't remember a year later.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And often, I'm asking you
to look back in my column.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I write 40,000 words
a month, my monthly.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.090 align:middle line:84%
My monthly is what
put me on the map,

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.620 align:middle line:90%
because people like the detail.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the average person
comes in 3.2 times.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to keep a
little bit of a record.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I know Oprah tells you to
write journals, but most of us

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:90%
don't have time to do that.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:84%
People have children, and jobs,
and they have things to do.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So just write, met a
new person, or signed

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
my lease on my apartment,
or whatever it is.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.645 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's big, just
make a note of it.

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On calendars.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.561 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It's kind of
fun at the end of the year

00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to look back and see
what happened that year.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why does it
impact a month before

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and a month after to the date?

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Because we
deal with bell curves.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Astrologers are dealing with--
it's part of the algorithm.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.650 align:middle line:90%
So it can impact either way.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.934 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And you think, oh,
I've avoided the eclipse,

00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:10.475 align:middle line:84%
and it's the month
to the day before.

00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:13.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's OK, though.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.600 align:middle line:90%
I like that kind of separation.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.325 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then what
about full moons?

00:38:17.325 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:90%
What's an intention?

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: A full moon will
bring everybody together,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:84%
tremendous energy, and it
will give you a conclusion.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And it may be something you've
been working on six months

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:84%
ahead, because the new
moon, let's say in Ares

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
might be in April, but
the full moon in Ares

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:90%
won't be until October.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
trying for a hard job.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people want it, and
you don't want to be annoying.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So you want to call up
right before a full moon

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
because they're
coming to a collusion.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I tell you in my column
when to make those calls,

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because you want to do
it at the right time.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.646 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you
set intentions?

00:38:56.646 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm always called
to that beautiful--

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:90%
A new moon, you plant things.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: A full moon is
really the culmination

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
of all your hard work, although
my book came out on a new moon.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:90%
That means a new beginning.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And if my publisher is
happy, which is Meredith,

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
it means the fact that my
book came out on the new moon

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
suggests that if
I do a good job,

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll get another offer
to do another book.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So on a full moon,
it just means you'll

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.630 align:middle line:84%
get a lot of press attention
and things like that.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.739 align:middle line:84%
There's a big spotlight
that goes on in a full moon.

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But in a
new moon, it means--

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It's time
to plant seeds.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So intention-setting at
that time is a good idea.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to know what you want.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Time can go through
your fingers.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.930 align:middle line:90%
You really need markers.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And astrology gives you that.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And every month, I tell
you what that new moon

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
will help you with it's
usually a very specific part

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
To look for an apartment,
to start dating again,

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:90%
to get a new job.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's one new moon a year
that happens at birthday time

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can use like a gift
certificate anywhere you want.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The universe wants to see
what's important to you,

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:90%
so you direct it where you want.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But you have to act right
after that new moon.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Not before.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Right after.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the
strongest at the beginning,

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and then it peters slightly
until we get to the full moon,

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and she's spent all her energy.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful white
moon, who comes

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:84%
in her gown and
her white gloves.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And she's now tuckered out
and needs her sleeping beauty.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the full moon
comes in to take her place.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that you
personify planets and moons.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, I think of
them as little people.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.101 align:middle line:90%
I talk to them.

00:40:48.101 --> 00:40:48.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.082 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do, don't you?

00:40:50.082 --> 00:40:50.999 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: I love them.

00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:52.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you have
to to do what you do.

00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, do you ever see
significant events happening,

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:84%
like the Me Too movement
or significant movements?

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, it's amazing
about the Me Too movement.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is not only the
giver of gifts and life,

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:90%
but the great healer.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And he rules sex,
money, and power.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:90%
He came in October 10th of 2017.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And almost a week later--

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when Mr.
Weinstein hit the news,

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:84%
but it was within 10
days or two weeks.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And it caused a
sociological shift,

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the likes of which I wouldn't
have thought possible.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's still going on.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:90%
We're still hearing things.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And different
industries are falling

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
like dominoes, because
entertainment was first--

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and music, of
course-- but there's

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be other
industries, too.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.462 align:middle line:90%
So it's not going to be over.

00:41:50.462 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:90%
But you're going to want to--

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.001 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter brings justice.

00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Having voices
heard, and so forth.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And it's
heartbreaking at times.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody like Charlie
Rose, who I always enjoyed

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:90%
his documentaries, I miss them.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:90%
But then I understand.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.732 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But at
the same time, you

00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:84%
can't do horrible
things to people.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I understand why the
networks said no.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's all coming into
balance, into justice.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:12.731 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:14.521 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, let me
ask you, if you could--

00:42:14.521 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and I know you're
really good at this--

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.696 align:middle line:90%
to run down the signs.

00:42:17.696 --> 00:42:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you're listening,
listen for your sign

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
here, because I know
you can do this.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, sure.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In a quick manner.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Ares, it's all
about travel this year.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to pick
a far destination

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and really have that
awe-inspiring experience.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If you say you can't go, you
have a little baby, whatever,

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.150 align:middle line:90%
you can go back to school.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
You can go for your
graduate degree,

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%
or you could just take classes
in a subject once a week

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and maybe get your
husband to babysit.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:90%
The Taurus.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Taurus is the one
sign that loves

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:90%
to see their bank account grow.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They actually sit
on a Friday night,

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and have a glass
of wine, and admire

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.950 align:middle line:90%
how their savings are going.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.790 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
delirious this year!

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
good news with money

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and how well they're
paying down debt,

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and really giving it
their all, and they're

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.770 align:middle line:90%
going to see amazing strides.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And if they need to borrow
money or get venture capital,

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:90%
fantastic year for that.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Gemini, it's all about marriage.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The sign most likely to marry,
or if they're already married,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to do well through
their husband or wife,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.230 align:middle line:84%
or they can use it
in a business way

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
to do well with their
agent, or publicist,

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:84%
or if you are the
publicist, you're

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:84%
going to have a great
talent to represent.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're both going
to make a lot of money.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to do very well.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Twosome is the
answer for Gemini.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, it's all about
health and fitness,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and eating right, and feeling
like a million dollars,

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and getting to
your personal best.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And if you work--

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.480 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're self-employed--
cash register rings.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.090 align:middle line:90%
People keep coming in.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to hire extra people.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Leo, It's all about
love, romance, happiness.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
It's also about baby.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my number one question.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Can I have a baby?

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Women are getting babies later.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is the best year to
have that baby if you want to.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What if you're a man?

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yep.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could be married to
a woman who's having a baby,

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or you can direct
it into creativity.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.640 align:middle line:84%
People say my book is my
baby and a portfolio is.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Virgo, it's such
great real estate.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm so
happy to tell Virgo.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They've had a hard time from
December 2014 to December 2017.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.362 align:middle line:84%
And they either had to take
care of a family member

00:44:37.362 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or they had difficulties
with their house

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:90%
for one reason or another.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Now it goes from black to white.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.360 align:middle line:90%
So happy.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When?

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.645 align:middle line:90%
When does that start?

00:44:44.645 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: It's happening now.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling it.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Actually, December and
June are the big months,

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:57.760 align:middle line:84%
December of 2018 and then next
year June, end of May and June.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Libra.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the year to
communicate and learn

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate in
a sophisticated way.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Start a blog.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Start a podcast.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Write for a magazine
or a newspaper.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Do documentaries.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Someone's going to give you
a podium and a microphone.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Good on you.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: [LAUGHS] So sharpen
your skills if you're a Libra.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Money, money, money.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
paid best of any sign.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
phenomenally well.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So don't be afraid
to ask for the raise.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Money's just
going to come to you.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It's like magic.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.434 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To a lot of signs.

00:45:32.434 --> 00:45:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, it's the
best in 12 years, remember.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.120 align:middle line:84%
They're not used to
seeing anything like this.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the one sign where it's the
Cornocopia and it's everything

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.720 align:middle line:84%
is Sagittarius, because
Jupiter's in Sagittarius,

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.760 align:middle line:90%
and it is the sign that rules.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And they get love, money,
business, they travel.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one thing
that's so important to them.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Many Saggs put off marriage
so they could travel.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:90%
But it could be a baby.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want
spiritually or materially,

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.830 align:middle line:90%
this is your year to get it.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Pick one or two things
and work toward them.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn, you're
in a waiting mode.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going into your best
year in December of 2019.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So you have to clear the decks.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Empty your basket,
cause the universe

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.760 align:middle line:90%
wants to fill it with goodies.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you have too much
in your basket already

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and haven't deleted the things
that no longer interest you,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.039 align:middle line:84%
you're like a little
kid in a candy store

00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:29.080 align:middle line:84%
eating too many candies
and getting a tummy ache.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You really
need to make room.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's a wonderful
time to have someone

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.460 align:middle line:84%
speak well about you
behind the scenes

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know about.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.494 align:middle line:90%
Then we have Aquarius.

00:46:42.494 --> 00:46:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius, it's all about
friendship this year.

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.670 align:middle line:90%
I want you to join a club.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get
out of the house.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't have to really
try too hard with Aquarius,

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:90%
because they love to socialize.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But this year, I want
you to expand your circle

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and see people of different
professions, not just

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.450 align:middle line:90%
your own industry.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of those people are
going to be lifelong friends.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:05.840 align:middle line:90%
This is a very important year.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also a year you could
do something for charity.

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the sign that's very
sensitive to the environment,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.410 align:middle line:90%
to humanity, to the animals.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Pick what you're
passionate about.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Roll up your sleeves.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.410 align:middle line:84%
What you learn in
a volunteer job

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:90%
can be used in your day job.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you want
to run for office,

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:84%
this is the year you'll
build a big constituency.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have
Pisces, the modest sign

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
has the biggest career of
his or her life this year.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, fantastic.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It sounds like
a great career for life.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
opportunity this year.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And money
and everything.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah,
this is exciting.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a good year.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Incredible.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.040 align:middle line:90%
You're amazing.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: [LAUGHS]

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.221 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, to know
these and to really

00:47:50.221 --> 00:47:52.720 align:middle line:84%
be able to recall this
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So now does this also
apply to teenagers?

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
talking about career--

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You have
to be about 12

00:47:58.864 --> 00:48:01.360 align:middle line:90%
before you start to feel these.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:90%
But let's say they're a Virgo.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're 10 years old.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.769 align:middle line:84%
Their parents may move and you
may get your own room finally,

00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and not have to share it
with your little sister,

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and you're just happy.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
about when you're

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.500 align:middle line:90%
talking about money and love?

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:90%
How does that translate?

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, yeah,
you do have to be older.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A little older, yeah.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: You do, yeah.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.697 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
horoscopes in the newspaper

00:48:21.697 --> 00:48:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking about
your marriage partner.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And nothing was going on.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.671 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what they
were talking about.

00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:28.964 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you do have
to be a little older.

00:48:28.964 --> 00:48:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if someone is going
through a particular challenge?

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:34.266 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever point
towards astrology

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to see when it's going to be
over, how it's going to end?

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah, I can
tell when the pain ends.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I can always tell that.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I can go backwards and forwards
in time, which is incredible.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Because it's math,
and you're looking at the tables

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:90%
that NASA gives you.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know when the
pain ends, but you're

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:84%
supposed to learn something
from the experience.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to set your watch.

00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So I can give ideas of
what you could learn

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.620 align:middle line:90%
and how to treat it.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.597 align:middle line:84%
I can even tell if you
should get a-- let's

00:49:06.597 --> 00:49:07.680 align:middle line:90%
say it's a health concern.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:90%
You should see a second opinion.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody should
get second opinions.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I've lived in
hospitals all my life,

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and every doctor gives
you little breadcrumbs

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that are different
from the one before.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you put all this
information together,

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.690 align:middle line:90%
you can a better decision.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:23.174 align:middle line:90%
You need a team these days.

00:49:23.174 --> 00:49:24.009 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:49:24.009 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you know someone's
sign based on when you see them

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:27.240 align:middle line:90%
or meet them?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: No, it's not like that
circus thing, can you guess.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I can sometimes.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But we are a very complex
combination of planets.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
your chart will never

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:47.340 align:middle line:84%
be replicated again in time,
space, or geography ever?

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The implication of
that is enormous.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We're so unique.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It means your
eyes, your sensibilities

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:90%
are valuable.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You know when you
were little, and you

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.993 align:middle line:84%
used to hear songs on the
radio, and you were wondering,

00:49:59.993 --> 00:50:02.050 align:middle line:90%
why do people like that?

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you grow up and
you don't listen to that

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.610 align:middle line:84%
because you're contributing
something else to the world.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Those fresh eyes
are so precious,

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
because as you're
growing up, you're

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.480 align:middle line:84%
seeing what's wrong
with the world.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can be one of the people
that helps to add and improve

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:21.970 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But you shouldn't listen
to what your mother tells

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.810 align:middle line:84%
you, or your professor,
or your best friend.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.672 align:middle line:90%
Do what you're passionate about.

00:50:31.672 --> 00:50:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does it mean
when someone's on the cusp?

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It means
that they're born

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.130 align:middle line:84%
right about when the
sun is about to move

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.950 align:middle line:90%
into the next constellation.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And the cusp babies
always feel like they're

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:84%
nobody's child, when in
fact, they're the luckiest.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Like, let's take November 22nd.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:84%
They take all the
best from Scorpio.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The shrewdness, the
good business sense,

00:50:55.550 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the fabulous negotiation,
the determination and passion

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of Scorpio.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And all the philosophy, and
optimism of Sagittarius,

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the love of travel,
and cultures, they

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
get both, because you can't
put a fence in the sky

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.180 align:middle line:90%
so that there's a blending.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Almost think of watercolors
and those two are blending.

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.105 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
the luckiest.

00:51:21.105 --> 00:51:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some of the most
creative, brilliant people

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:90%

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.720 align:middle line:90%

they're actually lucky.

00:51:27.386 --> 00:51:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.916 align:middle line:84%
That really helps in
not being judgmental

00:51:30.916 --> 00:51:33.290 align:middle line:84%
if you really know everyone
has their own unique imprint.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm amazed
that people are

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:84%
so judgemental in
our society, and I

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:90%
don't know when that happened.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because people
are not like them.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, since the
dawning of mankind, it's been,

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess, irresistible
to make fun

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:90%
of what you don't understand.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I say that to some of the
reporters who review me.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:59.790 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You have to take a lot
when you become an astrologer.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But I always say, just
follow me for six months

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.130 align:middle line:90%
or have your chart done.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't say it doesn't work if
you've not studied it or even

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.160 align:middle line:90%
tried to learn about it.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Make an attempt.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, your
accuracy is incredible.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I think,
one of the reasons

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.360 align:middle line:84%
why you have such
a huge following

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.430 align:middle line:90%
is because you are so accurate.

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It's the
German side of my family.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you know I wrote
for Vogue Japan,

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and we got this request
from them it was on Excel.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were asking so
many questions about my year

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.539 align:middle line:90%
ahead a few years ago.

00:52:34.539 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my secretary, I
don't even know where to begin.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.230 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
let's do it together.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, are they
asking me to rewrite this?

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure, but she
said they need it in 10 days,

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.360 align:middle line:90%
so we better start.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.210 align:middle line:90%
So every night we went through.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, tell me if you
want me to rewrite something.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Susan, you
just passed a big test.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.850 align:middle line:90%
We were testing you.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to see if you'd
come up with the right answers.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And you passed the
test beautifully.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It was just a test.

That is so nice that

that you cared enough.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.310 align:middle line:84%

And you know what?

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The CEO of the company and the

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:90%
They want to find love.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They want to have their
children do well and be healthy.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And you want to push back
the borders of your life

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:84%
to see what you can
make of your life.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very creative
experience living.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And creative people
tend to love astrology.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They love the symbolism
and the what-ifs

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:14.940 align:middle line:84%
they can do with astrology,
because astrology has such firm

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:19.060 align:middle line:84%
structure that, let's say you
came in and say, all right,

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.660 align:middle line:84%

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
kings in Mesopotamia,

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.110 align:middle line:90%
is there advancing armies?

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Is there famine?

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to run out of
money for defense, or whatever?

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can answer
those questions.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can see your state
of mind when you were five.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I can say, what happened
when you were really little?

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I said to one of my
photographers, I said,

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.320 align:middle line:84%
what was so sad
when you were born?

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Your mother was just so sad.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you see
this in the chart?

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And he said, I

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.450 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want to give you up.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever look for her?

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.080 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I didn't.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I was happy with the new
parents they gave me.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was so small.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, it broke her heart
to give you up, David.

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:90%

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Take my child.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.402 align:middle line:90%
I don't want him anymore.

00:55:25.402 --> 00:55:26.818 align:middle line:84%

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%

>>MILLER: Oh, all
kinds of people.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Four

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:41.500 align:middle line:90%
to do charts for their clients.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I write so much it's
hard for me to read charts.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But when the Four
Seasons asks you

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:50.950 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles on Doheny
Drive, I said, OK.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:52.020 align:middle line:90%
This one lady came to me.

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:90%
She's very quiet.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you do?

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.460 align:middle line:90%
She said, I'm a designer.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, are you here for
the Creative Arts Emmys?

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Because the whole hotel--

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, did you win one?

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I see you finishing a big
project, but it's bittersweet.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's right on the
eclipse, July 12th,

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.660 align:middle line:84%
or it was the next
eclipse, July 27th.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.120 align:middle line:90%
They come two weeks apart.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.860 align:middle line:90%
She said, it was July 12th.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, what happened?

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.610 align:middle line:84%
She said, it was our
last day of filming,

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and after five years
of being together.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you work on?

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:32.560 align:middle line:84%
She said, I am the chief
designer for "Game of Thrones."

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said we would
never see each other again

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.640 align:middle line:84%
because they've
ended the series.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.490 align:middle line:90%
So it was bittersweet.

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I see you
working on something new.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But you're in the
library a lot and you're

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:90%
doing all this research.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you see
all this in a chart?

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, yeah.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it
starts in October.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.895 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening?

00:56:48.895 --> 00:56:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm the first woman
ever to be given the job of set

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.302 align:middle line:90%
designer for "Star Wars."

00:56:56.302 --> 00:56:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So I said, you're
going from the past and history

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.620 align:middle line:90%
to the future.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And people will be studying
your work in the future

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and how you design it.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh!

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I know,
it's a big responsibility.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so wonderful.

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I'll be working
in London with Lucasfilm,

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:13.790 align:middle line:90%
she told me.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the best one.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.741 align:middle line:84%
My assistant said,
it was a couple.

00:57:18.741 --> 00:57:20.990 align:middle line:84%
A gay couple wanted to know,
would you do two of them?

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, sure, if they
asked, of course.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.614 align:middle line:90%
So the girl.

00:57:25.614 --> 00:57:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, you've got to write.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You've got all these
planets and writings.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It's screaming, write!

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.640 align:middle line:90%
She said, I do.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I write screenplays.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.710 align:middle line:90%
But now I'm writing for myself.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I write for television, but now
I'm writing a movie for myself.

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So now I move to her
partner, who's an Ares,

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and she's got all
these daring planets.

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
don't write, but you

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:49.390 align:middle line:90%
do something, maybe even scary.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, I dismantle
bombs for the FBI.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, of course you do!

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god!

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.150 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, right
now I'm on loan for NYPD.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, good.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you two working
together on a movie?

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.240 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm writing a
movie asked on terrorism,

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and Jacqueline is showing
me how to do it properly.

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:13.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, I love those movies.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.278 align:middle line:84%
When they're on
the phone, should I

00:58:15.278 --> 00:58:17.780 align:middle line:84%
cut the yellow wire, or the
red wire, or the blue wire?

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:22.451 align:middle line:84%
And Jacqueline said to me,
what if they're all red?

00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, gosh,
what happens then?

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:27.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, I know
how to dismantle it.

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I said, your mother
wants you to get a new job.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.860 align:middle line:90%
She said, yes, but I'm not.

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] She was such an Ares.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone should
do a movie on your life.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You have had quite
an amazing life.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask you--

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I love hearing
the stories though.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.119 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --what is the biggest
reason why you do what you do?

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.161 align:middle line:90%
What is your biggest why?

00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:45.869 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I want to
do for the world what

00:58:45.869 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:90%
my mother did for me.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.320 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the courage to
learn how to walk again.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, I was getting
so many operations.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:53.010 align:middle line:84%
They put you on
a tilt table when

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.960 align:middle line:84%
you have circulatory
problems, just

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to be upright.

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you go on
that parallel bars.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And just to get a
magazine across the room

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:01.940 align:middle line:90%
was like going to Arizona.

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you're back on the tilt
table after another surgery.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So you kept feeling
like it's Groundhog Day.

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But my mother, she
would never come in

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and say, how's the pain?

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.600 align:middle line:84%
She'd say, Susie,
when they fix the leg,

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll have so many shoes you'll
line them up against the wall

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and say, which shoes
will I wear today?

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:22.899 align:middle line:90%
And you'll have party dresses.

00:59:22.899 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to go to parties
and you'll be able to travel.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I could never travel
because I never

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.606 align:middle line:90%
knew when an attack was coming.

00:59:28.606 --> 00:59:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even go to camp.

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go anywhere.

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.160 align:middle line:90%
I had to be near home.

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:84%
She said, the whole world's
going to open up to you.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And I want to do exactly what my
mother did for me for everybody

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:43.500 align:middle line:10%
else, because life is hard,
and there are challenges,

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.560 align:middle line:10%
and you need guidelines.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.220 align:middle line:10%
And my mother said to me, don't
tell anyone you know astrology.

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.637 align:middle line:84%
But it's such an
advantage, Susan.

00:59:51.637 --> 00:59:53.469 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
what you tell everyone,

00:59:53.469 --> 00:59:54.685 align:middle line:90%
so it works for us.

00:59:54.685 --> 00:59:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
sharing with us about destiny

00:59:58.170 --> 00:59:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and about astrology.

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Susan.
