[MUSIC]

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.453 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.055 align:middle line:10%
When we lose someone we love,
we would almost do

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:84%
anything just to get that last
piece of communication,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.427 align:middle line:84%
or to hear that person's voice
again.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
It's as if hearing their words
would break down those walls

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:35.535 align:middle line:84%
of grief and give life back to
those who are grieving.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.871 align:middle line:84%
And this is what James Van
Praagh said

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.707 align:middle line:84%
when describing his work of
over 30 years.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.111 align:middle line:84%
James is a psychic medium, and
for most of his life,

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:47.547 align:middle line:84%
he's heard the subtle whispers
of spirit, as he calls them,

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and those whispers between our
earthly world,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and the finer etheric world of
spirit.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.688 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show James Van
Praagh.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Thank you List, thank you for
having me, I appreciate it.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.424 align:middle line:90%
Great to have you here.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.059 align:middle line:84%
So when you do hear these
whispers,

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.128 align:middle line:84%
I mean sometimes they come
through really strong,

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they come through
as a whisper,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.698 align:middle line:90%
how do you know the difference?

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.167 align:middle line:10%
It really depends on the
spirit, how they're going

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.437 align:middle line:10%
to project the image or the
thought into my consciousness.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.873 align:middle line:10%
And there are some
communicators that are very
very good,

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.309 align:middle line:10%
at projecting a thought,
projecting an image,

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.644 align:middle line:84%
and there are others that
really have a hard time

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:84%
to project it, so it really
depends on the spirit,

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:90%
how good they are doing it.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.785 align:middle line:84%
I gotta ask you about
dimensions and worlds,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.954 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, and this isn't
it, is it?

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.255 align:middle line:90%
We're not just us, right?

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
No, no we are souls having a
physical experience,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.692 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:33.727 align:middle line:84%
Some people think this is it,
this physical world

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.096 align:middle line:84%
is all there is, they're very
very wrong.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.732 align:middle line:84%
There's just a piece, a small
piece, a small percentage

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.501 align:middle line:84%
of who we truly are, including
our souls, people think

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.571 align:middle line:84%
this is our soul, no this is a
very small piece of our soul.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
It sure gives us a good visual
though doesn't it,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.911 align:middle line:84%
everything around us looks like
it's so physical.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
So when these beings are
communicating to you,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.851 align:middle line:84%
where are they coming from,
where do they exist?

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.288 align:middle line:84%
It's very much, I will tell
people, it's interdimensional,

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
in that right now we're sitting
here

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.124 align:middle line:90%
in a three dimensional world,

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.959 align:middle line:84%
and we're at this physicality
of it.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:84%
But really all around us, are
really other dimensions,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.931 align:middle line:84%
just like we have radio waves,
and television waves,

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.834 align:middle line:84%
and microwaves, gamma rays, all
around us they're existing,

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.036 align:middle line:84%
but yet we're not attuned to
them, because we're

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle line:84%
at a physical level, but the
spirit world's the same thing,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
we're gonna have faster
vibration of energy,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.443 align:middle line:84%
faster frequency, and those
dimensions of the spirit

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.413 align:middle line:84%
are all around us,
interpenetrating if you will,

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:26.913 align:middle line:90%
the physical.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.882 align:middle line:84%
And a medium is someone who is
able to,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:84%
attune themselves to those
higher vibrations,

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.787 align:middle line:84%
those higher dimensions, that
are right around us.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.023 align:middle line:84%
So really, I'm a good listener,
if you will.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.392 align:middle line:84%
Well, also a skilled one after
doing it for so long,

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.494 align:middle line:84%
you've really find tuned your
craft.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:43.597 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's very very true, and
it's ironic,

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.133 align:middle line:84%
because you really have to sit
and be quiet,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.868 align:middle line:90%
in order to hear spirit.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.437 align:middle line:84%
And I sat for many many years
in a development circle,

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
which really consists of
sitting in the quiet,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.576 align:middle line:84%
listening to what goes on in
the mind, and that's so ironic,

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.445 align:middle line:84%
but that's really when you hear
a spirit.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.313 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with your mind
chatter now?

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.649 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you still have, mind
chatter?

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.217 align:middle line:90%
I do have mind chatter,

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.253 align:middle line:84%
but nothing is severe as it use
to be.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:09.823 align:middle line:84%
I've really been able to really
put it in the right position

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.725 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and see it for
what it is.

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:14.561 align:middle line:84%
And I see what is real, and
what is not real--

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.497 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a lower vibration,
does it have a heavier

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
frequency when you have your
own cycle of chatter going on?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.037 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the mind chatter, yeah
tends to be egocentric,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
ego based, so, a lot of it's
ego, and yeah,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.709 align:middle line:84%
that's a lower dimension if you
will,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.779 align:middle line:84%
not that the ego's lower
dimension, but everyone's

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.548 align:middle line:84%
got to be careful, because it's
a fine balance,

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.149 align:middle line:84%
everything is balance and
moderation,

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.251 align:middle line:90%
and the ego is as well.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.853 align:middle line:84%
So did you hear these voices
when you were younger,

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.557 align:middle line:84%
did they frighten you, and what
was your childhood like?

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.426 align:middle line:84%
Just like the movie The Sixth
Sense, that's the easiest

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.195 align:middle line:84%
way to know what my childhood
was like.

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.497 align:middle line:84%
I was very much that child in
The Sixth Sense,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.865 align:middle line:84%
where I would see spirit all
the time,

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:55.836 align:middle line:78%
I would see spirit around
people, see lights around
people,

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.537 align:middle line:84%
known as the aura, the colors
around people,

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle line:84%
I would know things before they
would happen,

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.408 align:middle line:84%
so I was very psychic, very
intuitive.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.844 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking my mother one
night,

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.012 align:middle line:84%
we were ready to say prayers at
bed,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.515 align:middle line:84%
at about seven years old, and I
said to my mom,

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.317 align:middle line:84%
"Who are those people at the
end of the bed?",

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:84%
and there were these beings,
with beautiful,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.955 align:middle line:84%
luminous lights all around
them, and she said,

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:17.524 align:middle line:84%
"Oh them?" She saw them too,
she said,

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
"Those are God's angels.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
"I used to see them when I was
a little girl."

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.395 align:middle line:84%
She said they'll always take
care of you, you have nothing

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:84%
to be fearful of, and really
that was the beginning,

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.968 align:middle line:84%
where I knew that this was
real, and that it was safe,

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing to be afraid of.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.872 align:middle line:84%
So she really instilled that to
me, seven years old.

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.807 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, but she couldn't
necessarily

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.976 align:middle line:84%
handle the gift as well as you
could, right?

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.277 align:middle line:84%
That's right, Lisa, that's
right.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.412 align:middle line:84%
In that generation, she was
very very psychic,

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.748 align:middle line:84%
very mediumistic, because she
used to say often,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.651 align:middle line:84%
she'd see spirit around her,
but in that generation,

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't something that you
really talked about,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.522 align:middle line:84%
being psychic, or being a
medium.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
She was also very Catholic,
very religious,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.259 align:middle line:90%
and that really played into it,

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.427 align:middle line:84%
because she wasn't really sure
about this sort of thing.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.329 align:middle line:84%
Why would you say in this
generation,

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.532 align:middle line:84%
this is more acceptable
language?

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.668 align:middle line:84%
It is, I think as human beings,
we evolve.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.303 align:middle line:84%
I think that the human being
evolves--

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.271 align:middle line:90%
One would hope.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.872 align:middle line:90%
I would hope so, I hope so.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
On a spiritual level we're
evolving,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.576 align:middle line:84%
and this Earth world we're in
evolves,

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:13.213 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's why we're
here, light workers,

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:16.149 align:middle line:84%
to bring in more of a level of
awareness,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.286 align:middle line:84%
to change the consciousness, so
I do think now

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:23.456 align:middle line:84%
that the playing field is much
much more open.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.493 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at the television
shows, the ghost shows,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.429 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual shows, it's more
mainstream,

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.364 align:middle line:90%
and everybody has an experience,

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.099 align:middle line:84%
everybody has a déjà vu
experience,

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.534 align:middle line:84%
has like a past life memory,
something goes on,

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:38.071 align:middle line:84%
and now people can talk about
it, where before,

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
years ago, you weren't able to
talk about those things.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.441 align:middle line:90%
Right...

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.609 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay in the closet
with those things,

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:90%
not any more.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.545 align:middle line:84%
People are free now to talk
about their experiences,

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.681 align:middle line:84%
and they're very real
experiences for people.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.416 align:middle line:84%
Well you have been the
executive producer

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:52.052 align:middle line:84%
on many of those shows that we
see on television,

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:55.188 align:middle line:84%
Ghost Whisperer, you created
the concept behind it,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.022 align:middle line:90%
based on your life.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.858 align:middle line:84%
Yeah based on my life, and yes,
based on my life.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.061 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very much so.

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine that
worked at CBS television,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.267 align:middle line:84%
and she became a client also,
and she was so moved

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.736 align:middle line:84%
by the experience, and about
the communication,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:84%
and the power of communication,
that this stuff is real.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.975 align:middle line:84%
And she really wanted to bring
it out

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:16.943 align:middle line:84%
to people around the world, and
she did that.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle line:84%
And it's good she was in a
position with television,

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.615 align:middle line:84%
that she was able to present
this in a network setting.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And now Ghost Whisperer is all
over the world,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.485 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone has seen this
show.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.152 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's based a lot on my
life.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.789 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because you
really did kind of

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.491 align:middle line:84%
break down the walls so that
people

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.293 align:middle line:84%
could have that in their living
rooms.

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.261 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.061 align:middle line:90%
Even thought it's--

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.864 align:middle line:84%
I take that, I do take that,
that is very true.

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.701 align:middle line:84%
When I went out there, it
really was the Beyond show,

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
my Beyond show and John did a
British show,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.204 align:middle line:90%
called Crossing Over.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:44.971 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.906 align:middle line:84%
Between the both of us, really
we're kind of out there.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was out there with
television, writing stuff,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.846 align:middle line:84%
producing stuff, getting
television movies made,

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.649 align:middle line:84%
and really pushing it that way,
because I believe

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.784 align:middle line:84%
the medium of television, or
this medium now,

00:06:58.784 --> 00:06:59.953 align:middle line:90%
of course it is changing.

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:84%
You really can use it the best
optimum way,

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.658 align:middle line:84%
and that is really to help
people grow spiritually,

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.692 align:middle line:90%
as you know--

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.427 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when you bring the
conversation

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.962 align:middle line:84%
out of the living room and off
of the phone

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.865 align:middle line:84%
with your best friend into a
medium like this,

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:13.199 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word--

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.767 align:middle line:90%
Badum-pum

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.103 align:middle line:84%
It really does make, it gives
it a lot more credibility,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.239 align:middle line:84%
but how do you deal with the
scrutiny,

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:20.907 align:middle line:84%
and the people that don't
understand

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.543 align:middle line:84%
what it is you do, and we
haven't even gotten fully into

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:26.513 align:middle line:84%
how you do communicate with the
lost loved ones.

00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:28.948 align:middle line:84%
Right, well you know when you
get into this type of work,

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.184 align:middle line:84%
as a medium, you have to be
true to yourself.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.453 align:middle line:84%
And part of sitting in
development, for myself,

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
I'm only answering for myself,
is really being sure

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.492 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, being true to
yourself, being true of spirit.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.695 align:middle line:84%
You know if I was to worry
about what people think

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.364 align:middle line:84%
about the work, well then my
ego would be getting

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:45.632 align:middle line:90%
involved, wouldn't it?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.301 align:middle line:84%
And the ego, when the ego's
involved like that,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.203 align:middle line:84%
you can't be like that because
then

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:84%
you won't have room for spirit
to come through.

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:55.075 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to get to a
position where you are safe,

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:58.178 align:middle line:84%
your ego is very very safe,
very very balanced,

00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.612 align:middle line:84%
you're very sure of what you're
doing,

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:84%
you know this is real, and you
have to trust,

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.517 align:middle line:10%
and you trust spirit.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:05.552 align:middle line:10%
And I know when I'm receiving

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:06.319 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.188 align:middle line:10%
And I'm receiving the visions,
the feelings,

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.023 align:middle line:10%
the communication, and then
when the person

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:13.026 align:middle line:10%
understands that, oh yes, my
father's name was Jerry,

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.595 align:middle line:90%
and he died on July 4th, 1955--

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.596 align:middle line:90%
Oh god.

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:84%
And the details, that's really
the proof in the pudding.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:22.068 align:middle line:84%
I've seen you in a room, and
the healing that occurs

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.437 align:middle line:84%
in the room when you do say I'm
hearing somebody,

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.272 align:middle line:84%
there was a tie that dropped in
the closet, and someone

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.942 align:middle line:84%
starts bursting out in tears,
and then you said

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:31.144 align:middle line:84%
"Well, he's here, is there a
Joseph?"

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:33.446 align:middle line:84%
and it just starts and the
magic starts.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.849 align:middle line:84%
The healing begins in the
people.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.885 align:middle line:84%
It blew my mind the first time
I saw you speak.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It was here in Los Angeles.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
I was just moved by the healing

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.059 align:middle line:90%
that occurred in the people.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say, Lisa.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.095 align:middle line:84%
I say I'm really a healer and
I'm a teacher.

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
There are many mediums out there

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:84%
but not every medium is a
teacher.

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, I should let people know
that

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.069 align:middle line:84%
just because someone says they
are a medium

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.872 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that they are
necessarily spiritual.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.373 align:middle line:84%
So they are two different
things.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.074 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:01.975 align:middle line:84%
You can be a incredible medium
and

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:84%
have great great details but
you're not

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.612 align:middle line:90%
necessarily spiritual.

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:06.946 align:middle line:84%
That explains some people I
know.

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle line:90%
That's very very true.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.849 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a big difference.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:10.984 align:middle line:90%
When I have the work I do,

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:90%
I am a healer.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.087 align:middle line:84%
I think that the work itself
heals people.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.121 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.122 align:middle line:84%
Because you alleviate, number
one,

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
the fear of death and when you
alleviate

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.158 align:middle line:90%
the fear of death,

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:19.692 align:middle line:84%
you really begin to live life
fully.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.327 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been on Larry
King.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.764 align:middle line:84%
You've been on every major
television show out there.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.633 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment Tonight did a
whole piece on you.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.735 align:middle line:90%
You really have, because of

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.103 align:middle line:90%
the impact that you're making.

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have one of those
videos.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.673 align:middle line:90%
I want you to take a look at.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.508 align:middle line:84%
This is James Van Praagh in
action.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:90%
(slow mystical music)

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:55.528 align:middle line:10%
Is everything he said true?

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.896 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it is.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:59.332 align:middle line:10%
He was in the hospital six
weeks before he passed.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.368 align:middle line:84%
He is television's most famous
medium and

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:05.605 align:middle line:10%
tonight, James Van Praagh is
having Hollywood visions.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.142 align:middle line:84%
There's some extraordinary
stories in James' book,

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:90%
"Talking to Heaven."

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:13.346 align:middle line:84%
Sue and Don Raskins' story is
one of them.

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:84%
Their 33 year old son Douglas
fell to his death

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.485 align:middle line:90%
climbing Mount Fuji in 1994.

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
They now say they have proof
that he was

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.022 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their dead son,
Douglas.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.659 align:middle line:84%
The proof is that James told us
when we went to see him

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.395 align:middle line:84%
there was a helicopter involved
and we said

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:32.198 align:middle line:84%
No, no, there's no helicopter
involved and

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:36.102 align:middle line:10%
he also said we would be
getting pictures

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.438 align:middle line:10%
after Doug died, we'd be
getting pictures

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:10%
of Doug climbing Mount Fuji and

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.575 align:middle line:84%
right before he fell off of the
mountain.

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.877 align:middle line:90%
We said, no, no.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.011 align:middle line:90%
There was no picture found.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:48.381 align:middle line:84%
Well, four months, it was about
three months later,

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:52.785 align:middle line:84%
we got a bill for $10, 000 for
the helicopter.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.821 align:middle line:84%
Then, we got a phone call that
they had

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.922 align:middle line:90%
found his camera.

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:57.757 align:middle line:90%
The climbing crew went back and

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.827 align:middle line:84%
they found his camera and they
developed the pictures

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.428 align:middle line:90%
and they sent them to us.

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.663 align:middle line:90%
We have them.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.498 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, it was just what
James said.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:84%
A picture of Doug before he
starts climbing the mountain

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:84%
and about twenty minutes before
he fell off the mountain.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:90%
That's the picture?

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.707 align:middle line:90%
That's the picture.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:18.011 align:middle line:84%
After he told you the picture
was coming?

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:22.615 align:middle line:84%
He also told us we'd be getting
a picture

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.117 align:middle line:90%
with a message on it.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.786 align:middle line:84%
On the corner of the picture it
said "I love you."

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:30.557 align:middle line:90%
This is the picture.

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:90%
How did that get on there?

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.827 align:middle line:84%
When he was in first grade, he
says,

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.363 align:middle line:84%
he knew his teacher's son would
be in an accident

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.332 align:middle line:90%
before it happened.

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:40.667 align:middle line:90%
I went up to her and I said,

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:90%
"Your son got hit by a car,

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.304 align:middle line:90%
"but he's okay, he's okay.

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.773 align:middle line:84%
"He just broke his leg but he's
okay."

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:47.807 align:middle line:84%
And she just looked at me and
she said,

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:50.443 align:middle line:84%
"You go back to your seat right
now."

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:51.844 align:middle line:90%
I thought, okay.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:55.081 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to tell her what
I saw.

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:57.183 align:middle line:84%
Ten minutes later, the
principal informed

00:11:57.183 --> 00:12:02.055 align:middle line:84%
Van Praagh's teacher that this
accident had occurred.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.924 align:middle line:84%
She asked how I knew that and I
started crying.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.359 align:middle line:90%
I was very scared.

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:08.561 align:middle line:84%
The reason why was because I
thought I caused

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:90%
that accident to happen,

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.464 align:middle line:84%
because I knew it was going to
happen.

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle line:90%
I thought I caused it.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.202 align:middle line:84%
I thank God to this day that
lady said to me,

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.437 align:middle line:90%
"No, no, no, no, James.

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:18.838 align:middle line:90%
"Don't worry, don't worry.

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:21.674 align:middle line:84%
"God gives special people
special gifts

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
"and one day you'll use those
gifts to help people."

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.012 align:middle line:90%
As I'm standing here before,

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:29.182 align:middle line:84%
this German Shepherd runs right
up and jumps on you.

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:31.117 align:middle line:84%
The dog appreciates you
carrying it,

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.785 align:middle line:84%
because you had to carry the
dog.

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:34.053 align:middle line:90%
You understand, please?

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Sir.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.923 align:middle line:84%
There is a picture you have of
this animal.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.459 align:middle line:90%
Very very beautiful.

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:42.228 align:middle line:84%
I can only tell you that this
animal appreciates

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.098 align:middle line:84%
all that you did for it and the
animal was in pain

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.568 align:middle line:90%
and its hind legs were not good.

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:50.403 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
My experiences were actually
extremely compelling

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:84%
and extremely convincing and
none of the things he said

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle line:84%
to either of us were anything
that

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.048 align:middle line:90%
would ever be researchable.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:05.351 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to say it's something
that I believe has happened.

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:06.419 align:middle line:90%
There were two hospitals

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to bring him
to.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.822 align:middle line:84%
Okay? I don't know if one was
full and they had to bring him

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:10.923 align:middle line:90%
to another hospital.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.191 align:middle line:90%
How could you know that?

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what he just
told me.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.427 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely true.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Who is A-m-a-?

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.965 align:middle line:90%
Amanda.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.833 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:84%
This is a lady that wants to
say hello to you

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and this lady, Amanda, wants to
give you her love.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.678 align:middle line:84%
Did she talk to you about
verses from the Bible

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:34.647 align:middle line:90%
or try to ever teach the Bible?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:38.518 align:middle line:90%
Aunt Mary? Yeah.

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:40.553 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.821 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Because she is showing me the
Bible.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.895 align:middle line:84%
She comes in with her Bible,
she's very proud of her Bible.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:54.367 align:middle line:10%
Because I get different things
different ways, okay?

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.769 align:middle line:10%
And what I picked up with this
man standing here

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.938 align:middle line:10%
was gunpowder.

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:02.375 align:middle line:84%
His heart is torn, too, his
heart is torn too.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:05.778 align:middle line:90%
He's here with you very much.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.447 align:middle line:84%
I know this thing, did he buy
this?

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:08.081 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:10.283 align:middle line:84%
Because he keeps on holding
this.

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.719 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I bought it for her."

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me,

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:84%
"She wore it today because she
knew

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.991 align:middle line:90%
"that it would attract me."

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.727 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:23.029 align:middle line:84%
Barbara's heart surgery,
breaking news.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.333 align:middle line:84%
Did this famed medium see it
coming?

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, "There's something
wrong with your blood."

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.107 align:middle line:84%
Even Cher had a reading after
the death

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.676 align:middle line:90%
of her ex-husband, Sonny Bono.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:38.811 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to Cher about these
earrings.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting down in her
closet the night before,

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:46.152 align:middle line:84%
looking at a pair of earrings
that he gave her.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:84%
She said, "That's exactly what
I was doing."

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.921 align:middle line:90%
Farrah Fawcett's best friend,

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Alana Stewart, sits down for a
tearful reading

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.227 align:middle line:90%
from James Van Praagh.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.428 align:middle line:90%
She said that?

00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:57.296 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Thank you for my
bracelet."

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:00.066 align:middle line:84%
And Alana said, "I'm wearing it
right now, here it is."

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:90%
And she showed it to the camera.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.171 align:middle line:84%
She gave this to me for my
birthday two years ago.

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:08.841 align:middle line:10%
James is being put in the right
place at the right time,

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:10%
only because he's listening to
spirit.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.213 align:middle line:84%
If he had a closed mind and he
wasn't listening,

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:15.248 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't be anywhere.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.384 align:middle line:84%
I've seen James five or six
times now,

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.453 align:middle line:84%
and that's one thing that
really impresses me

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:23.856 align:middle line:84%
about him is the detail that
comes through.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.359 align:middle line:84%
The things that nobody else
would know about.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.127 align:middle line:90%
Tonight, here at the Queen Mary,

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:31.831 align:middle line:84%
a ship known world wide of
hauntings of her very own.

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:33.833 align:middle line:84%
Are these owners going to learn
that their items are

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:36.169 align:middle line:84%
truly possessed or are we
simply in

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:38.871 align:middle line:84%
for a night of great ghost
stories?

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:43.042 align:middle line:84%
I get this creepy, scary
feeling of it's not settled

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:46.979 align:middle line:84%
and it's like there are some
deaths already done

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.247 align:middle line:90%
with these instruments.

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:51.317 align:middle line:10%
You won't believe who he made
contact with.

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.619 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh is a great man.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.556 align:middle line:84%
He and I have had the
opportunity to get

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:58.191 align:middle line:90%
a unique friendship going.

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.394 align:middle line:84%
I always kind of feel him in a
strange way.

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:03.796 align:middle line:90%
Celebrity Ghost Whisperer

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.765 align:middle line:84%
James Van Praagh's warning for
Brittany Spears.

00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
What he's been able to share
with me

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:90%
has been extraordinary.

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:10.703 align:middle line:90%
There are two ghosts on her.

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:13.773 align:middle line:84%
What happened here even had me
surprised.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:17.043 align:middle line:90%
I do believe Sonny's helped her.

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:19.111 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many times
he's been right.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
There's a much bigger picture
going on here.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle line:84%
Oh. You do angels, or work with
angels or something

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.585 align:middle line:90%
having to do with angels?

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:90%
My name is Angel.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.689 align:middle line:84%
That shows the power of your
work and

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:31.891 align:middle line:84%
how it's been recognized
internationally

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:33.392 align:middle line:90%
through different media.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.595 align:middle line:84%
You also have a lot of
different celebrities

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.629 align:middle line:90%
who have come through you and

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:37.797 align:middle line:90%
come to you for readings.

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:38.364 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:38.965 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them.

00:16:38.965 --> 00:16:40.399 align:middle line:84%
Cher is probably the most
well-known who

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.268 align:middle line:84%
came to me after Sonny passed
away and

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:44.103 align:middle line:84%
Sonny came through really
really well.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:46.305 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was the night
before the Academy Awards

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:49.442 align:middle line:78%
and he talked about the
earrings, that she was in the
closet

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:51.277 align:middle line:84%
the night before, certain
earrings he gave her.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:52.678 align:middle line:90%
He brought up names of people,

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.848 align:middle line:84%
Armenian names of people and it
was pretty amazing.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.551 align:middle line:84%
I been through a lot from
people.

00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:01.854 align:middle line:84%
I've had Abraham Lincoln has
come through me,

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.357 align:middle line:84%
Charlie Chaplin's come through
me,

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.058 align:middle line:90%
oh gosh, lots of different.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.493 align:middle line:90%
Liberace's come through me.

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:10.695 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people, lots of people.

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:12.964 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to kind of turn on,

00:17:12.964 --> 00:17:14.634 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word,

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.368 align:middle line:90%
the ability to hear these?

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:18.704 align:middle line:84%
Or else you would be barraged
all day long?

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and part of learning how
to do this work

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.643 align:middle line:84%
in development is learning how
to turn on, turn off.

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:25.278 align:middle line:90%
So, it's like a radio station.

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:26.646 align:middle line:84%
You have a radio, your turn the
radio on

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:28.114 align:middle line:90%
you tune into a station.

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.048 align:middle line:90%
That's like me.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I turn on, I put myself in a
receptive space

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.818 align:middle line:84%
and then I kind of tune into
the whispers,

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.086 align:middle line:90%
the subtle whispers.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.589 align:middle line:84%
the feelings, the emotions that
I'm receiving

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:37.957 align:middle line:90%
and I give them out.

00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:39.191 align:middle line:84%
When I'm finished doing the
work,

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.526 align:middle line:90%
I kind of shut down.

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:42.094 align:middle line:84%
I take away the awareness and
then

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.329 align:middle line:90%
I'm back to normal.

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:44.463 align:middle line:90%
An everyday person.

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.465 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because I
measure it

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.968 align:middle line:84%
based on the amount of truth I
feel.

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.836 align:middle line:84%
When I heard or I saw the piece
where

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:90%
Farrah Fawcett came through you,

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
instead of talking about the
fact that

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.142 align:middle line:84%
she died on the same day as
Michael Jackson.

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.643 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.245 align:middle line:84%
There were little things when
Farrah Fawcett came through,

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:03.416 align:middle line:84%
little subtleties, which, being
the voice box basically

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.817 align:middle line:84%
I never know what's going to
come through

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:05.885 align:middle line:90%
or what they're going to say.

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.887 align:middle line:84%
The personalities really come
through.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:09.722 align:middle line:84%
I remember that she was talking
about

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:12.625 align:middle line:84%
a bracelet she'd given her
friend and

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
she was actually wearing the
bracelet.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.728 align:middle line:84%
She talked about being upset
because

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jackson died around the
same time she did.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.232 align:middle line:90%
Same day, yeah.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:21.434 align:middle line:84%
So much publicity for him, a
little for her

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.102 align:middle line:84%
but she was very understanding
but--

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:90%
(laughter)

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.805 align:middle line:84%
Alana Stewart. Alana Stewart
had had the reading.

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:84%
She was wearing the bracelet
that she gave her

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:29.675 align:middle line:90%
and Farrah mentioned it.

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.143 align:middle line:90%
"You're wearing my bracelet."

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:36.148 align:middle line:84%
When somebody crosses over or
moves on as spirit,

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:40.519 align:middle line:84%
do they really want to come
through and communicate

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:43.055 align:middle line:84%
with the person who is still on
this Earth plane

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.524 align:middle line:84%
when they really have an
attachment to someone?

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.293 align:middle line:84%
Like losing a father or a child
even?

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.628 align:middle line:90%
Just like the movie, "Ghost,"

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
which I think is a wonderful
depiction

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.765 align:middle line:90%
of how it really is,

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:10%
when you leave this physical
shell which

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:10%
is very painless, there's no
pain involved

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.438 align:middle line:10%
with leaving the body, no pain
whatsoever.

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.207 align:middle line:10%
Leading up to the death, there
might be some pain

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:03.976 align:middle line:10%
involved with the type of way
you pass out,

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.277 align:middle line:90%
but when you actually leave,

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:06.545 align:middle line:84%
when the spirit leaves the
physical body,

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:07.813 align:middle line:90%
there is no pain.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.115 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things they
want to do is

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.116 align:middle line:90%
to tell their loved ones,

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:12.585 align:middle line:90%
"I'm okay, I'm alive, I'm fine.

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:14.186 align:middle line:90%
"You don't need to grieve.

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.488 align:middle line:90%
"You don't need to be upset,

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.923 align:middle line:84%
"Don't be upset about my death
because I'm not dead.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.492 align:middle line:90%
"I'm very alive."

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all go to their
funerals.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.762 align:middle line:84%
They all go to their funerals,
their memorial services.

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:25.798 align:middle line:84%
They'll see who is standing in
the funeral chapel there.

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:26.799 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:27.733 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine that would be
healing because

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:30.302 align:middle line:84%
if you have someone who maybe
died a painful death

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:33.539 align:middle line:84%
or a disease or an illness and
you watch their physical body

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:90%
go through such pain,

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:37.977 align:middle line:84%
to imagine them no longer in
that pain

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:40.346 align:middle line:90%
it takes a leap of faith.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.848 align:middle line:84%
It does but a lot of times,
spirit will come back and say,

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.051 align:middle line:84%
"Mom, please don't remember me
that way.

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:46.619 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not in that car crash.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:48.354 align:middle line:84%
"Mom, that's not my body like
that,

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.856 align:middle line:84%
"that's withered and dried up
like that.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.058 align:middle line:90%
"That's not who I am.

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.426 align:middle line:84%
"Don't remember me that way
because

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:90%
"that's not who I was.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
"That was the old me, I'm the
young vital person now.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.498 align:middle line:90%
"That's my spirit."

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.999 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is very very young.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:02.968 align:middle line:84%
We all go back to the younger
part of our lives,

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.103 align:middle line:90%
the prime of our lives.

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:90%
We do?

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.807 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's say we die when
we're 70 or 80 or 90s.

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:09.842 align:middle line:84%
You tend to go back to the
prime of your life,

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.811 align:middle line:84%
the time of your life that you
liked the most.

00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:14.847 align:middle line:84%
Most people tend to go back to
their 20s or their 30s.

00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:16.649 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting, Lisa.

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:18.984 align:middle line:84%
When the spirit does come back
and they will communicate,

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
many times they will
communicate in memories,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.722 align:middle line:84%
very fond memories that the
person receiving

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.424 align:middle line:90%
the information will understand.

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:27.359 align:middle line:84%
Like, your dad is talking to me
about the lake,

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.028 align:middle line:84%
you used to go to the lake and
have barbecues

00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:29.895 align:middle line:90%
in July and August.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.163 align:middle line:90%
Yes we used to do that.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.933 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about ride in
the boat.

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.469 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we used to do that, those
were great memories.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:37.937 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's going to bring
through.

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.205 align:middle line:84%
So, they often come back that
way.

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:40.206 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that makes sense and

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.341 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen in a room,
too, as well.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%
So, when we have those memories,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.346 align:middle line:90%
if we've lost a loved one,

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.582 align:middle line:84%
can we then communicate to our
loved ones

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:50.816 align:middle line:90%
through those memories?

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:51.984 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can.

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.619 align:middle line:84%
There's easy ways to
communicate with spirit.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:56.122 align:middle line:84%
People think you need a medium
to do it.

00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:56.889 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:58.958 align:middle line:84%
A medium is someone who is able
to hear them clearly

00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.327 align:middle line:84%
and really be able to translate
what they're saying,

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:03.896 align:middle line:84%
translate the images, the
impressions,

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:05.998 align:middle line:84%
but everybody can hear from
their loved ones.

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.267 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you go to
sleep at night,

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.069 align:middle line:84%
ask that they come to you in
your dreams.

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:11.437 align:middle line:84%
That's the number one way they
communicate

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.305 align:middle line:84%
is the dream state so they'll
come through your dreams.

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a dream of them.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.175 align:middle line:84%
Or keep a journal next to your
bed.

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:19.278 align:middle line:84%
Try to meditate and quiet your
mind and listen to them.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
They'll start writing a message
to you.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.948 align:middle line:84%
Why would they come through our
dreams?

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.151 align:middle line:84%
It's the easiest way to get
through because

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.386 align:middle line:84%
we're not on our rational
conscious mind.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:90%
We're not in the critical mind.

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.189 align:middle line:84%
That little mind chatter that
says

00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:31.757 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, this can't possibly be."

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.826 align:middle line:84%
That little left brain, that
left part that's

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:35.895 align:middle line:84%
analyzing, critiquing
everything.

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:36.996 align:middle line:90%
We're not in that space.

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:40.199 align:middle line:84%
We're away from that so it's
easy to drop something in.

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.935 align:middle line:84%
So, we're not in a place of
being able to move, either,

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:45.337 align:middle line:90%
so our minds are pretty clear.

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:49.675 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the wonderful
reasons I'd love

00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to have you on the show and
you're here,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.613 align:middle line:84%
so that people who are in that
space of grief

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:56.782 align:middle line:84%
can get some communication and
maybe

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.751 align:middle line:90%
try some things on their own.

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why I love what you do.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
People try this in the privacy
of their own home

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.525 align:middle line:90%
in their quietest hours.

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:90%
"I heard this person talk and

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.296 align:middle line:84%
"maybe this works so maybe I'll
try this."

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:12.364 align:middle line:84%
They have to be consistent
about it.

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:13.265 align:middle line:90%
You can't be like

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.301 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to do this tonight
and have results right away."

00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:16.202 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:18.904 align:middle line:84%
It's really a process and it's
a process of,

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:22.041 align:middle line:84%
if you will, training the mind
also to be open.

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us have a lot of
trouble quieting the mind.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.646 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to train the mind
to quiet the mind.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.114 align:middle line:84%
The more you do it, the better
you get it at.

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.083 align:middle line:84%
Another great exercise I have
people do

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.885 align:middle line:84%
is to write a letter to their
loved one.

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:35.087 align:middle line:90%
Sit down and physically write.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.822 align:middle line:84%
Letter writing has gone out for
the computer,

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.657 align:middle line:84%
but I think that it's wonderful
when you can

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.359 align:middle line:84%
take the time and the energy to
sit and

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.961 align:middle line:90%
write them a love letter.

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:46.365 align:middle line:84%
A letter, just a note, what you
want to think about them,

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.833 align:middle line:90%
what you want to say to them.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.901 align:middle line:90%
Then, put that letter away.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.636 align:middle line:84%
Fold it away, put it in an
envelope

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.471 align:middle line:84%
and put it in your drawer for
probably two weeks.

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
In your calendar, write down
"response" and

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.943 align:middle line:84%
then two weeks later you sit
down with a paper

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:01.146 align:middle line:84%
and let them write a letter to
you and

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.282 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you people will get
results.

00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:05.985 align:middle line:84%
I have had thousands and
thousands of my clients do this

00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:07.253 align:middle line:90%
and it's a staggering amount

00:23:07.253 --> 00:23:08.721 align:middle line:90%
how many get results right away.

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:11.123 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, "Wow, I never even
thought it that way."

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.191 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.259 align:middle line:84%
So, you clear your mind and you
just allow

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.228 align:middle line:84%
the information to come through
as a response?

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.297 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:20.866 align:middle line:84%
Another one they can do, and I
teach this in my class,

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:23.736 align:middle line:84%
is to get into that quiet
space, if you will,

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:27.539 align:middle line:84%
and just become focused on that
person

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.141 align:middle line:90%
that passed into spirit.

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.909 align:middle line:90%
Just become them.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:33.812 align:middle line:84%
Let them use your body, let
your eyes become their eyes,

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:36.115 align:middle line:84%
your hands become their hands,
your arms their arms

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.817 align:middle line:84%
and let them just take you over
and be.

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:40.352 align:middle line:90%
Then listen.

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what comes through in
your mind.

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:45.357 align:middle line:84%
You'll be amazed at what comes
through.

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:48.627 align:middle line:84%
The opinions, perspectives on
things change.

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:50.095 align:middle line:90%
It works really really well

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.697 align:middle line:84%
so it's another way of doing
that.

00:23:51.697 --> 00:23:53.032 align:middle line:90%
There's always ways .

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:54.166 align:middle line:90%
They're right around us.

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.801 align:middle line:90%
They share the space around us.

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of us
breaking down those walls

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.639 align:middle line:84%
so as to enable them to come
through easier.

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.741 align:middle line:84%
Could you do that even maybe
for someone

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:05.077 align:middle line:90%
who hasn't passed over?

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:07.479 align:middle line:84%
Just to get communication with
the spirit in general

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:11.517 align:middle line:84%
because the perspectives of
spirit must be enormous.

00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:14.086 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can do that,
especially with people--

00:24:14.086 --> 00:24:15.888 align:middle line:84%
because spirit to spirit can
communicate.

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:17.189 align:middle line:90%
We're physical beings but

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:19.091 align:middle line:84%
we're also spirit first and
foremost,

00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:21.226 align:middle line:84%
so the spirit of somebody, you
can certainly

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.895 align:middle line:90%
call for them to come to you,

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
someone who's living,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.497 align:middle line:84%
and you can work with them that
way.

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.465 align:middle line:90%
What is the spirit that--

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.734 align:middle line:84%
the perspective that spirit
usually has?

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:30.169 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:33.505 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing because I've have
a near death experience

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:38.377 align:middle line:84%
several years back and I've
done this work for thirty years

00:24:38.377 --> 00:24:39.778 align:middle line:84%
but even with the work I've
done,

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
when I had that near-death
experience

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.214 align:middle line:90%
it was a whole different world.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.283 align:middle line:84%
It kind of opens you up
immediately

00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:45.918 align:middle line:90%
to the wholeness of your being

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:47.619 align:middle line:84%
and you see that this one
physical body

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.723 align:middle line:84%
is really just a tiny piece of
who we really are.

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:53.425 align:middle line:84%
I realized that from a soul
perspective

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.027 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected.

00:24:55.027 --> 00:24:58.497 align:middle line:10%
From my years of experience I
had an awareness

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.099 align:middle line:10%
that everybody had, if you
will, like a ribbon

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:02.568 align:middle line:10%
at the top of their head which
attached to a tapestry,

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:05.437 align:middle line:10%
a Universal tapestry, that
we're all connected to

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:06.772 align:middle line:10%
and whatever we thought

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:08.507 align:middle line:84%
would change the color of this
ribbon.

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.142 align:middle line:84%
So, if we thought of the word
"love,"

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful pink light would
come out and

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.147 align:middle line:84%
in turn really influence that
tapestry.

00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:18.617 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how you then
become aware of your thoughts.

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:19.685 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are things.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:20.853 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are real.

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.522 align:middle line:84%
We are our thoughts and you
begin to see,

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:25.758 align:middle line:84%
"Wow, what I'm thinking affects
that person

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:27.192 align:middle line:84%
"and that person and that
person."

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.627 align:middle line:90%
The Universal tapestry.

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.229 align:middle line:90%
What a great vision.

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
What a great visual as well.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.898 align:middle line:90%
It's real, it's so real.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and if we could all really
indeed

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.435 align:middle line:90%
changes those thought.

00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:38.103 align:middle line:84%
Take responsibility for our
thoughts.

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:39.405 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:41.807 align:middle line:84%
That's the key, to realize that
thoughts are living things

00:25:41.807 --> 00:25:45.177 align:middle line:84%
and are you proud of what
you've left to the world?

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:47.312 align:middle line:84%
Are you proud of what you've
left as a human being?

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.481 align:middle line:84%
Because when you pass over to
the spirit world,

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.016 align:middle line:84%
you're going to look back at
your life and

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.419 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see all the
thoughts that you've sent out,

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:56.488 align:middle line:84%
all the feelings you have sent
out and you will see them.

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:84%
So, I just want to tell people
that are watching this,

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:00.993 align:middle line:84%
I hope you are proud of what
you send out into the world.

00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:03.462 align:middle line:84%
So, you see how they affect
other people as well.

00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:04.196 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:06.965 align:middle line:84%
I often say to people it's like
a painting.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:08.967 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are creating a
painting and

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:10.202 align:middle line:84%
when you pass through to the
spirit world,

00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:12.171 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see how
beautiful your painting is

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:13.772 align:middle line:84%
or how disturbing your painting
is.

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:15.707 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to see when
you pass over?

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:18.243 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's more important to
know that now.

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:20.279 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.079 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.615 align:middle line:84%
That's why I see what you say
about having responsibility

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:25.851 align:middle line:84%
for our actions and our
thoughts now.

00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:28.921 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned, as a soul, you
keep referencing

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:30.422 align:middle line:90%
"as a soul,"

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.223 align:middle line:90%
Do we--?

00:26:31.223 --> 00:26:32.391 align:middle line:90%
Having a physical experience.

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:34.059 align:middle line:84%
We are souls having a physical
experience,

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.327 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:38.197 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
perspective to have.

00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:39.798 align:middle line:84%
When we start having that
perspective,

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:43.969 align:middle line:84%
again, the key understandings
of life start changing

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:46.405 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to see things from
that soul point of view

00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:90%
not the physical point of view.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.742 align:middle line:84%
Do we reincarnate in soul
groups,

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:53.245 align:middle line:84%
where we over and over again
want to come back

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:55.147 align:middle line:90%
and complete these soul groups?

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:56.982 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes we do.

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:59.551 align:middle line:84%
Soul groups are really just
souls who've come back

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.687 align:middle line:84%
and shared lifetimes with each
other,

00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:90%
the same lifetimes,

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.356 align:middle line:90%
the same experiences.

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
We are all souls and people ask
me about soulmates.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.495 align:middle line:90%
Is there a soulmate?

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:10.796 align:middle line:90%
I think there are soulmates.

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:13.165 align:middle line:84%
I think there are souls who
share many, many lifetimes,

00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:15.567 align:middle line:84%
many, many experiences so
there's an affinity that

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.902 align:middle line:90%
grows up between them.

00:27:16.902 --> 00:27:18.570 align:middle line:90%
So, there's not one soul mate.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.038 align:middle line:90%
No, soulmates, I would say.

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:21.607 align:middle line:84%
Now, there might be one soul
that you've had

00:27:21.607 --> 00:27:24.977 align:middle line:84%
really all lifetimes with and
that might be somebody

00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:27.446 align:middle line:90%
you'd have love times with,

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:29.515 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes you've shared many,
many

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:30.549 align:middle line:90%
many, many things.

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:34.086 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I call it more a twin
soul, if you will.

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:90%
A twin soul.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:84%
A twin soul, two halves coming
together.

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.124 align:middle line:84%
But I think we really have all
soulmates.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:43.161 align:middle line:84%
I think people have an idea
that this physical Earth

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.897 align:middle line:90%
is the only place to go to.

00:27:44.897 --> 00:27:46.798 align:middle line:84%
This Earth is really one
schoolroom of

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.667 align:middle line:90%
many, many, many schools.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:51.336 align:middle line:84%
This Earth is just, it's a hard
school here,

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.538 align:middle line:84%
because there are people here
that

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:55.107 align:middle line:84%
are unevolved and people that
are evolved.

00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:84%
There are people that still
think war is the answer

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:59.778 align:middle line:84%
when it isn't, because you
can't kill people.

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.547 align:middle line:84%
There are many many solar
systems,

00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:03.382 align:middle line:90%
many star systems, if you will.

00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:04.883 align:middle line:90%
Many, many places to go.

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.518 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is just one
schoolroom out of

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:09.054 align:middle line:84%
millions and millions and
millions.

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:10.956 align:middle line:90%
So if we've chosen it this time,

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to come into this schoolroom
and to be here now,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.796 align:middle line:84%
then we have a certain level of
responsibility, don't we?

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.565 align:middle line:90%
Yes we do, you bet we do.

00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:90%
Of course we do.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:22.768 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a quick
break and

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:23.936 align:middle line:84%
when we come back, we're going
to talk about

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:27.139 align:middle line:84%
the upcoming year, 2013, and
different things

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:30.075 align:middle line:84%
that James has to share with us
about our lives

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:33.378 align:middle line:84%
and what we have to look
forward to going forward.

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.212 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.781 align:middle line:84%
You're watching Gaiam
Inspirations.

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:36.748 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:37.482 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC]

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:56.335 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to Gaiam
Inspirations.

00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:57.436 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr

00:28:57.436 --> 00:28:58.937 align:middle line:10%
and my guest is psychic medium,

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.606 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh, author of

00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:03.709 align:middle line:84%
"Talking to Heaven," among many
other books.

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:06.511 align:middle line:84%
"Growing Up in Heaven," the one
about children.

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So, I asked right before the
break

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
about 2013 and what we have to
look forward to

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:84%
and I definitely want to talk
about children.

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:90%
So, what is--

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.756 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I've got to look
back on 2012 for a second.

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:18.757 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty amazing, wasn't
it?

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing year.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.293 align:middle line:90%
What a shift.

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:22.661 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:23.695 align:middle line:90%
Shift happens.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:24.396 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:26.131 align:middle line:84%
Did you experience an intensity
at the end?

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:27.833 align:middle line:90%
Totally, did you?

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:32.471 align:middle line:84%
The end of the year, it was
like a train wreck almost.

00:29:32.471 --> 00:29:33.839 align:middle line:84%
Could that be because everyone
was

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:90%
thinking about the change?

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.841 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone was expecting
that big thing

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:39.878 align:middle line:10%
to happen in December and a lot
of energy on that.

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:10%
The day after was over it was
like,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.948 align:middle line:10%
ahh, relieved.

00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The day that we turned into the
new recycle,

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.985 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning of January,

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:49.121 align:middle line:90%
I felt an instant relief.

00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:50.622 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that same?

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:52.057 align:middle line:90%
Totally. Same thing exactly.

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:53.325 align:middle line:90%
Actually the day after that.

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:57.763 align:middle line:84%
Was it because the intensity
and the attention

00:29:57.763 --> 00:29:59.431 align:middle line:90%
was lifted?

00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:00.465 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Or was alleviated, exactly.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.602 align:middle line:90%
That's what energy is.

00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:04.636 align:middle line:90%
It's letting that stuff go.

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:05.504 align:middle line:90%
So, it's exactly right.

00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:06.738 align:middle line:90%
2013 is going to be, I think--

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.141 align:middle line:84%
everything is a great year
depending on

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.475 align:middle line:84%
how you look at it, your
perspective--

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:84%
but I think this is going to be
a big change

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.278 align:middle line:90%
in this year as well.

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.913 align:middle line:90%
I think there's going to be,

00:30:14.913 --> 00:30:16.181 align:middle line:84%
I think there is going to be a
lot of people

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
questioning their belief
systems here.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.985 align:middle line:84%
I think that you're going to
see a lot of Earth changes

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:90%
this time around, too.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.221 align:middle line:90%
I do, I do feel that.

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.723 align:middle line:84%
I feel that there's going to be
a lot of

00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:26.224 align:middle line:84%
pulling to people's
spirituality.

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to really
go into spirit,

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.663 align:middle line:84%
into their own spiritual self
and learn what

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.165 align:middle line:90%
resonates as truth within them.

00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:35.133 align:middle line:84%
I think there's going to be
challenges

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.468 align:middle line:90%
to the belief systems,

00:30:36.468 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I think religion's going to be
challenged even more so

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.105 align:middle line:90%
this year than ever before.

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:41.406 align:middle line:90%
So, it's really happening.

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.441 align:middle line:90%
The light is here, you know?

00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:44.042 align:middle line:90%
The light is among us.

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:46.044 align:middle line:84%
When you have this amount of
light,

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.212 align:middle line:90%
it illuminates the darkness.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.648 align:middle line:84%
It illuminates the darkness
when it comes to the surface.

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Is there going to be a lot more
tragedy

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.451 align:middle line:90%
and natural disaster?

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:53.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's always going to
be some of that.

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:54.519 align:middle line:90%
I do think so.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.221 align:middle line:84%
Those types of things have been
predicted

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and they were predicted
especially last year.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.392 align:middle line:90%
I think we will.

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we will have a lot of
water changes,

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.996 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of the water,
whether that's flood

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:06.665 align:middle line:90%
or whether that's hurricanes.

00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:07.866 align:middle line:90%
A lot of that.

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.301 align:middle line:90%
I predict some Earth movement.

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.504 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because you
can always say

00:31:12.504 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be tragedy,

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:15.807 align:middle line:84%
and there's going to be Earth
changes but

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:84%
in particular, what we're
seeing now is unprecedented.

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So, it's just going to--?

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.615 align:middle line:90%
I think it's going to continue.

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:26.151 align:middle line:84%
Lots of the Earth changes and
things,

00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:28.019 align:middle line:84%
there are always going to be
changes,

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.588 align:middle line:90%
the Earth changes every day.

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:30.922 align:middle line:90%
But it will be significant.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:34.626 align:middle line:84%
So what can suggest to us, as
spirit, to do in those

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:38.663 align:middle line:84%
types of times of change to get
closer with the family,

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:41.266 align:middle line:90%
to get a network around you?

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.768 align:middle line:90%
Yeah and you've been with me,

00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we've had on a radio
show you've done

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.939 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned to one of the
callers which was wonderful

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:51.143 align:middle line:84%
was to have that group around
you, the networking group.

00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:55.714 align:middle line:10%
And it's really a time to
really take hold of who you are

00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:57.682 align:middle line:10%
and your spiritual self, you
know?

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:58.984 align:middle line:10%
You really have to start
questioning,

00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:01.319 align:middle line:10%
educating yourself about
spirit, you know?

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:04.422 align:middle line:10%
The power is really someone who
has an awareness.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.057 align:middle line:90%
You're saying what I'm thinking.

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.726 align:middle line:90%
The telepathic communicaton--

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:08.827 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:10.028 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do for a living
there, Lisa.

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:14.299 align:middle line:84%
But I think practicing
telepathic communication

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:90%
is really the way of the future.

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.269 align:middle line:90%
Sure, because we're all energy,

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.805 align:middle line:84%
so if we emanate energy, we're
sending out thoughts.

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:20.806 align:middle line:90%
That's energy

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:22.908 align:middle line:84%
So, we can do things with our
minds.

00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:24.075 align:middle line:90%
We are, that's who we are.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And we send these thoughts out
with our mind,

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.346 align:middle line:84%
that energy, it will change and
make a change.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:29.848 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you think of
something

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:30.682 align:middle line:90%
it goes somewhere.

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:31.817 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't just exist and

00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:34.052 align:middle line:84%
really just evaporate into the
ether.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.987 align:middle line:90%
It goes to what the target is.

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:38.056 align:middle line:84%
What you're thinking is where
the thought will go.

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.424 align:middle line:84%
I notice that a lot with my
daughter.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.059 align:middle line:84%
She spits out things that I'm
thinking.

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.528 align:middle line:84%
Right away, because the veil's
very thin

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:46.464 align:middle line:84%
when they're younger and not as
cluttered, the mind.

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:50.502 align:middle line:84%
So, something will happen to me
and the next day

00:32:50.502 --> 00:32:51.469 align:middle line:90%
she'll say,

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:53.872 align:middle line:84%
"Mommy, I had a dream about
this happening to you."

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:55.841 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:32:55.841 --> 00:33:00.178 align:middle line:84%
So, you've written about
children.

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:01.513 align:middle line:90%
I have written about children.

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:04.549 align:middle line:84%
This last book, "Growing Up in
Heaven,"

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.184 align:middle line:84%
it's very interesting how this
came about.

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.153 align:middle line:84%
I was in my office, doing my
work,

00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.588 align:middle line:90%
answering emails probably,

00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:11.022 align:middle line:84%
and these children, spirit
children,

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.657 align:middle line:84%
came into the office and I'm
looking around

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.325 align:middle line:90%
and I'm saying,

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:14.893 align:middle line:84%
"Okay, what are they doing
here?"

00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:16.494 align:middle line:90%
And I heard, they said to me,

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.129 align:middle line:90%
in different ways,

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.331 align:middle line:84%
"We're here to write your next
book,"

00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:20.432 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like "What?"

00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:21.766 align:middle line:90%
My guides came through later on

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.568 align:middle line:84%
and they said "Yes, the
children are going to help you.

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
"You're going to write a book
about children

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.105 align:middle line:84%
"and for parents who have lost
children."

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Really?"

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.507 align:middle line:90%
And the book is really that.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.909 align:middle line:84%
The book is about what happens
to a child

00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:90%
when they pass into spirit,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.646 align:middle line:84%
how does it help the people
left behind,

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:36.348 align:middle line:90%
how to help them.

00:33:36.348 --> 00:33:39.451 align:middle line:90%
Why do they pass over so young?

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:41.553 align:middle line:84%
What happens when they go to
the other side.

00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:45.624 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful book and it's
helped thousands

00:33:45.624 --> 00:33:47.559 align:middle line:84%
and thousands and thousands of
people

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:48.793 align:middle line:90%
who have lost children.

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was really guided by the
children's spirits?

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.365 align:middle line:84%
By the child. The children's
spirits.

00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.933 align:middle line:90%
So you know, a soul--

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:56.301 align:middle line:84%
it's just interesting to say
this--

00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:58.703 align:middle line:84%
a soul, we come back onto this
Earth world,

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
we go through as many lessons
as we can and

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.042 align:middle line:84%
when it's our time to leave and
graduate,

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
we move on.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.579 align:middle line:84%
So, our soul comes back for
experience.

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:10.348 align:middle line:84%
A soul might be very evolved
and they only need

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:11.983 align:middle line:90%
eight years of Earth experience,

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.485 align:middle line:90%
or twenty years.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Then it's time to move on.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what it's
about.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.157 align:middle line:90%
How could God do this?

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:21.626 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not about God,

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:24.161 align:middle line:84%
it's about the souls living
out, if you will,

00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:90%
what it's destiny.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.266 align:middle line:84%
What about souls, like the
group of kids--

00:34:29.266 --> 00:34:30.735 align:middle line:90%
So, Connecticut?

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.103 align:middle line:90%
The group of kids there.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:33.038 align:middle line:90%
I can't say.

00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:35.507 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in that situation,
there was an agreement

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:36.808 align:middle line:84%
before they came back to the
Earth.

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:37.876 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard to think

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:39.511 align:middle line:90%
"How could somebody do this?"

00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I do think a group soul,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.047 align:middle line:90%
a soul group,

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.649 align:middle line:84%
will get together and they'll
put themselves

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:47.085 align:middle line:84%
within a situation where they
will all experience

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.721 align:middle line:84%
one thing so that situation can
teach

00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands of others
if not

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.658 align:middle line:90%
millions of others.

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.927 align:middle line:84%
So, hopefully from this
situation in Connecticut,

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.729 align:middle line:90%
there will be gun control laws,

00:34:57.729 --> 00:35:00.165 align:middle line:84%
there will be changes in ways
of bringing through

00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:90%
guns, if you will,

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:04.336 align:middle line:84%
something has to happen and it
will.

00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:09.341 align:middle line:84%
Also, when we have that level
of tragedy that happens,

00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:12.777 align:middle line:84%
we still have yet to see what
will come out of it.

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.679 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Mothers Against
Drunk Driving.

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.348 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that mother that
created that

00:35:16.348 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:90%
had to have that experience.

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:84%
That child's soul had to go
through that experience

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.322 align:middle line:84%
in order to graduate to this
level of awareness

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.658 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:28.426 align:middle line:84%
You don't know when it happens
why it's happening.

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:29.861 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:31.029 align:middle line:84%
And it's very very interesting
because

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.431 align:middle line:84%
I deal with parents who have
lost children all the time

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:35.467 align:middle line:84%
and they say, "What am I
learning from this, James?

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:36.601 align:middle line:90%
"What am I learning?"

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:37.602 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.437 align:middle line:84%
Just wait, wait, because years
from now,

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.673 align:middle line:84%
your experience will be very
very valuable to

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.944 align:middle line:84%
someone else who is going
through the experience.

00:35:45.944 --> 00:35:46.745 align:middle line:84%
So, you never know if it's
going to be

00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:47.912 align:middle line:84%
writing a book, starting a
support group,

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.247 align:middle line:84%
starting a radio show, changing
things around.

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:54.252 align:middle line:84%
You know, we never go through
this world alone

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:57.055 align:middle line:84%
and we always are guided in
what we are doing.

00:35:57.055 --> 00:35:58.857 align:middle line:84%
I also want to say a little
more about

00:35:58.857 --> 00:35:59.991 align:middle line:90%
children who have passed over.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.927 align:middle line:84%
I often say to parents well, as
souls, in a past life

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:05.463 align:middle line:84%
maybe you left early and that
soul had to learn what

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.332 align:middle line:84%
it was like to lose a child
then.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:09.067 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to learn what
it's like,

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:10.568 align:middle line:84%
so there's a balance if you
will.

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.404 align:middle line:84%
There's a wholeness to the
experience.

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.305 align:middle line:84%
When you're going through that
level of grief

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.574 align:middle line:84%
and I can't imagine anything
worse,

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
but when you're going through
that level of grief

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.246 align:middle line:84%
my prayer is that someone
watching right now

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:22.947 align:middle line:90%
will hear what you're saying and

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:26.017 align:middle line:84%
establish that communication
and create a healing.

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.053 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's going to
happen.

00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:29.487 align:middle line:84%
And realize that they are not
alone.

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:30.622 align:middle line:84%
Their loved one is still with
them,

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:31.856 align:middle line:84%
the children are still with
them,

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:34.526 align:middle line:84%
very much guiding them, leading
them, helping them.

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:36.194 align:middle line:90%
So, there is no death.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.429 align:middle line:90%
So, how can they?

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:39.497 align:middle line:78%
You talked about other
techniques of how to
communicate.

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:44.502 align:middle line:84%
Can you set up an agreement,
say with my husband,

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:49.074 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Hey, why don't we
communicate through clouds

00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:51.109 align:middle line:90%
"if one of us leaves early?"

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:52.777 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are different signs
and different ways

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:84%
the spirit will communicate and
the most common way

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.815 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned earlier was a
dream state.

00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:58.249 align:middle line:90%
They come through your dreams.

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.484 align:middle line:90%
Another way, electricity.

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, spirit can affect, if
you will,

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.155 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field
around things.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:06.257 align:middle line:90%
Radios, computers, televisions.

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:84%
You'll get these weird signals
happen

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.963 align:middle line:90%
or a song will turn on suddenly.

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.666 align:middle line:84%
Or butterflies, dragonflies,
birds.

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.868 align:middle line:84%
People will say, "My mother's a
butterfly.

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:90%
"Every time I see a butterfly,

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.038 align:middle line:90%
"I know it's my mother."

00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:21.372 align:middle line:90%
Is it her mother?

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.373 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.341 align:middle line:90%
I would say this.

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.143 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the mother's
spirit is probably

00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:27.812 align:middle line:84%
right next to that person and
projecting their image

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:29.781 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness of that
person

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:31.883 align:middle line:84%
so in turn that person
associates.

00:37:31.883 --> 00:37:34.419 align:middle line:84%
When they see that butterfly,
they'll think of their mother.

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So in a way, yes it is.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.589 align:middle line:84%
There's stories and stories
that have come through.

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:40.825 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather, when he died,

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:44.095 align:middle line:84%
a bird flew straight through
the front door to the bathroom

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.797 align:middle line:90%
and everyone in the house said,

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:47.565 align:middle line:90%
"That's Grandpa."

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.766 align:middle line:90%
I think there's an electric--

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:78%
I believe that there's an
agreement with the animal
kingdom

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.739 align:middle line:84%
in some way because they work
with us.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:57.041 align:middle line:84%
That happened also to me, with
my mother,

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:59.677 align:middle line:84%
with a bird type of thing,
sitting down for like an hour

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:00.845 align:middle line:90%
next to me.

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.881 align:middle line:84%
So, it does happen that they
can influence

00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:05.083 align:middle line:84%
and we work with them, the
animal kingdom.

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:07.051 align:middle line:84%
So, pay attention to what goes
around you.

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.686 align:middle line:84%
I have done that with my family
members.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.622 align:middle line:84%
With my mom, we're going to
communicate through flowers

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:90%
and I just have done that

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.225 align:middle line:84%
because I've heard it enough
times.

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.059 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.462 align:middle line:84%
There are ways people are going
to hear thoughts

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:18.863 align:middle line:90%
in their head of someone or

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:19.964 align:middle line:90%
they'll look at someone looks

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.332 align:middle line:84%
just like their mother passed
over.

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:24.802 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll sense smells like
flowers or tobacco

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.104 align:middle line:90%
or aftershave.

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:27.539 align:middle line:84%
Something you can associate
with your loved one

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:90%
who passed over.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.542 align:middle line:84%
They will come through any way
they possibly can.

00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:32.777 align:middle line:84%
Scent, that's an interesting
point.

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:37.282 align:middle line:84%
Do you sense a floral, a very
strong floral scent

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:39.017 align:middle line:90%
when spirits around?

00:38:39.017 --> 00:38:40.051 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the spirit.

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.119 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how they want to

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:90%
project and communicate.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.856 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who can
do that very very well.

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:46.658 align:middle line:84%
As long as the person can
associate.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:48.326 align:middle line:90%
My mother used to love roses.

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:51.329 align:middle line:84%
They'll project the smell of
roses, it's very very strong.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:53.798 align:middle line:90%
Or a perfume smell, you know?

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.934 align:middle line:84%
Do you think those smells can
actually be

00:38:55.934 --> 00:39:00.605 align:middle line:84%
infused into oils and where
there is energetic infusions.

00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:01.706 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe in those?

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.041 align:middle line:90%
I would not be surprised at all.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:04.142 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't it?

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:05.143 align:middle line:90%
Based on what you know?

00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, why couldn't it?

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because you'd really
really have to refine it

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.982 align:middle line:90%
down to a certain level.

00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:11.683 align:middle line:90%
Frequency.

00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:13.651 align:middle line:84%
Yes, frequency, which is very
very slow, slow.

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.386 align:middle line:90%
It's really really hard.

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:16.888 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure with a lot of
concentration and work

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:18.022 align:middle line:90%
they could do that.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.023 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of work.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.858 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of energy for
them to come down

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:84%
into a three-dimensional world
or

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.229 align:middle line:84%
to be known in the
third-dimensional world.

00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:90%
So, when spirit talks to you,

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.999 align:middle line:84%
is the vibration so much faster
and higher?

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:30.201 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's very very much so and

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to kind of attune myself
to that

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.172 align:middle line:90%
higher frequency, if you will.

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:37.008 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm pretty energetic so
I'll pick up on that.

00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:40.078 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm known as a
good medium

00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:42.614 align:middle line:84%
because I'm able to hear those
higher frequencies,

00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:44.782 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to tune myself to
those higher vibrations.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:47.685 align:middle line:84%
Me, as a physical human being,
I'm hyper anyway

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:48.953 align:middle line:90%
so I think that helps.

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.488 align:middle line:90%
You're already a little bit--

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:84%
My makeup is so it helps, I
think.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.559 align:middle line:84%
A little hyper anyway so it
helps.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.095 align:middle line:84%
When I see you in action, you
do,

00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:59.664 align:middle line:84%
you get very very fast and
spirit comes in

00:39:59.664 --> 00:40:01.499 align:middle line:90%
and you tell them to slow down.

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.301 align:middle line:84%
Slow down yes, because they are
too fast.

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:04.902 align:middle line:90%
It moves very very quickly.

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:08.206 align:middle line:84%
They'll be like sending me
thoughts and images.

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:09.741 align:middle line:90%
It's very much like if I say,

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:11.676 align:middle line:90%
"Hello, how are you today?"

00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:13.244 align:middle line:90%
The spirit way would say,

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.679 align:middle line:90%
"Hello-you-today."

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:17.982 align:middle line:84%
It's so quick and many times
they'll get through,

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:18.883 align:middle line:90%
let's say a name.

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.252 align:middle line:90%
It will say "Mary. Mary."

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And I will hear "Mary."

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.921 align:middle line:84%
So, I'll say "There's a lady
here named Mary."

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.889 align:middle line:84%
The person in the audience will
say

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:28.526 align:middle line:90%
her name is Marie, not Mary.

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.194 align:middle line:90%
But you see how close it is.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:30.862 align:middle line:90%
That's what you hear.

00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:32.263 align:middle line:84%
So when I get, as a medium, I
have to go with

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.798 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I'm hearing.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.433 align:middle line:84%
Do you see it like a strip of
pictures

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.534 align:middle line:90%
that come through?

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:38.269 align:middle line:90%
Flooding images?

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.537 align:middle line:90%
All different.

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.707 align:middle line:84%
I'll see them as pictures, as
blending of pictures.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:44.976 align:middle line:84%
I'll see a person standing
there and they'll look

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:47.078 align:middle line:84%
physically I'm looking at you
right now?

00:40:47.078 --> 00:40:48.179 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly that.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.848 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll see just a head or I'll
see just a face

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.917 align:middle line:90%
or I'll see a beautiful suit.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.852 align:middle line:84%
Something how they can project
into my consciousness

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:57.755 align:middle line:84%
an image, a thought, that I'm
able to give to the person

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.257 align:middle line:90%
that they understand it's them.

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:01.592 align:middle line:84%
I'm known as a Survival
Evidence Medium,

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.127 align:middle line:84%
which means that my job is
really to

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:05.563 align:middle line:84%
bring through evidential
details,

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:07.265 align:middle line:90%
names, places, events,

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:08.766 align:middle line:90%
that only that person would know

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:09.901 align:middle line:90%
and the spirit would know.

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:11.469 align:middle line:84%
It proves survivor
consciousness.

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:12.537 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever done any work with

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.639 align:middle line:90%
the police or investigators?

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Or the government?

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.642 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I used to do a lot of work
with

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:19.677 align:middle line:10%
police agencies.

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.846 align:middle line:10%
Years and years ago, I used to
work mostly

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:24.048 align:middle line:10%
in kidnapping cases.

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:27.185 align:middle line:10%
Quietly, off to the side, I've
worked

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:28.820 align:middle line:90%
on some well-known cases too,

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.054 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not going to talk
about.

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:32.724 align:middle line:90%
But I have worked in some cases.

00:41:32.724 --> 00:41:34.325 align:middle line:90%
Interesting stuff.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.794 align:middle line:84%
I saw files of some of these
things.

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.197 align:middle line:84%
But, when the kidnapping thing
happened,

00:41:39.197 --> 00:41:41.699 align:middle line:84%
and there's a movie, my movie
with Ted Danson,

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.835 align:middle line:84%
an early part of that movie is
sort of about

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.104 align:middle line:84%
kids that have been kidnapped
and taken away.

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:47.605 align:middle line:84%
Part of that was really gleaned
from my work

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.906 align:middle line:90%
with kidnappings.

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.442 align:middle line:84%
But, I had to stop it because
it was so

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.578 align:middle line:90%
brutal at one point and

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:55.246 align:middle line:84%
I remember the very last one I
was working,

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:56.748 align:middle line:90%
a case in New Orleans,

00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
out there in the swamp area
outside New Orleans.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.285 align:middle line:84%
There was a little girl who was
three years old who died

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.421 align:middle line:84%
and she came through to me and
I saw everything

00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:05.556 align:middle line:84%
from this man that had killed
her.

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:06.524 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God, no no no.

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:07.759 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I don't do that
anymore.

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:08.826 align:middle line:90%
I can understand that.

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.461 align:middle line:84%
You have to close it off at
some point.

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:14.065 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you are
specifically seeing right now

00:42:14.065 --> 00:42:18.603 align:middle line:84%
around us or around our
communication at all?

00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:20.238 align:middle line:90%
Here is this room you mean?

00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:23.241 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling that things
are going to expand here

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.111 align:middle line:90%
and I have a feeling

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.312 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to be bigger
and bigger.

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.014 align:middle line:90%
Think internationally.

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:32.183 align:middle line:84%
China is going to be pretty
big, too.

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:34.719 align:middle line:84%
I see you're going to travel
with this show.

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:36.287 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be traveling
with it.

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:37.722 align:middle line:84%
I think this is just a very
small part of

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:38.956 align:middle line:90%
what this is going to go to.

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.191 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is a big vision.

00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:41.259 align:middle line:90%
Gaiam Inspirations.

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:90%
The whole network is.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.662 align:middle line:84%
It's really a great vision and
I think that

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:47.865 align:middle line:84%
everyone at Gaiam, they have to
really--

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:49.267 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam needs to respect
themselves

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:51.169 align:middle line:84%
because they are doing this
work and

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.438 align:middle line:84%
getting the word out and it's
very very important.

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:54.605 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful to hear.

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:55.706 align:middle line:84%
Okay, we're going to take a
look at

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.542 align:middle line:90%
another piece of James' work and

00:42:57.542 --> 00:42:58.876 align:middle line:90%
you can see James in action.

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.782 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Bayside, New York,

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:07.518 align:middle line:84%
which is a suburb of New York
City and

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.821 align:middle line:84%
I was the youngest of four
children.

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.722 align:middle line:90%
I had a sister, Lynn,

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:12.857 align:middle line:90%
a brother, Michael,

00:43:12.857 --> 00:43:14.826 align:middle line:90%
a sister, Moira and myself.

00:43:14.826 --> 00:43:17.595 align:middle line:84%
I found that my childhood was a
little bit lonely

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:19.297 align:middle line:90%
in a way when I look back,

00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:24.302 align:middle line:84%
only because I could see things
that other kids could not.

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.238 align:middle line:90%
I think that I was raised,

00:43:27.238 --> 00:43:30.141 align:middle line:84%
I think we are all brought into
this life, on this Earth,

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:31.476 align:middle line:84%
and we pick our families and
friends.

00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:32.877 align:middle line:90%
I do believe we are soul groups.

00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:34.645 align:middle line:84%
I think we come back in soul
groups and

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.848 align:middle line:84%
I picked a mother who was an
alcoholic.

00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:39.016 align:middle line:84%
So, she had an addiction and as
a child,

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:42.019 align:middle line:84%
I hated her because I didn't
have a normal childhood

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.955 align:middle line:84%
and I used to wish she was dead
and I used to think

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:45.656 align:middle line:90%
these horrible things.

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:84%
As you grow up and as you
evolve as we all do,

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:51.629 align:middle line:84%
we look back at things and we
see the lesson.

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.998 align:middle line:90%
Now that I look back, of course,

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.633 align:middle line:90%
my early 20s I think it was,

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.269 align:middle line:84%
actually when she first passed
over,

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:00.605 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it was a
disease, number one

00:44:00.605 --> 00:44:02.206 align:middle line:84%
and then as I evolved
spiritually,

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:04.642 align:middle line:84%
getting more aware of what this
stuff is

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.644 align:middle line:84%
all about, that we are spirits
first and foremost

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:07.979 align:middle line:90%
having a physical experience,

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I picked that
situation in my life

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
as we all do and I picked that
situation because

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.986 align:middle line:84%
I needed someone to teach me
about compassion.

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So, I wouldn't have been able
to do that work

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.989 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing now without
learning about

00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:20.424 align:middle line:84%
what compassion is and what
better way to learn it

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:23.094 align:middle line:90%
than from your mother?

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:25.596 align:middle line:90%
So much pain but so much growth.

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.665 align:middle line:84%
So much growth through the pain
and

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.667 align:middle line:84%
afterwards I realized we've got
to see the bigger picture.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.902 align:middle line:90%
That was the funny thing.

00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:34.071 align:middle line:84%
She was an incredible, great,
funny woman.

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:37.475 align:middle line:84%
Great sense of humor, very very
quick, very very witty

00:44:37.475 --> 00:44:40.177 align:middle line:84%
and I think I understood why
she was in that way

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:84%
because I think she was also
very psychic,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.748 align:middle line:90%
very very sensitive.

00:44:43.748 --> 00:44:45.016 align:middle line:84%
She used to get impressions all
the time

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:46.751 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't know what it was
and

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:48.085 align:middle line:90%
she was raised Catholic.

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.654 align:middle line:90%
Very Catholic, Irish Catholic.

00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:52.023 align:middle line:84%
I think it was her way to shut
them off,

00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.825 align:middle line:84%
shut off the information, the
intuition.

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.028 align:middle line:84%
I also think emotionally she
wasn't getting

00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:00.197 align:middle line:84%
satisfied from the relationship
with my father and

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I think in those days, in that
generation,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.902 align:middle line:84%
you stayed together, you didn't
divorce.

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:06.304 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything about
divorce.

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:08.573 align:middle line:84%
I think that was part of it,
too,

00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:10.141 align:middle line:84%
so I think in a way she was
trapped.

00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:12.843 align:middle line:84%
I understand now that was her
way of escape.

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:16.414 align:middle line:84%
So, I've really got to say to
people that judgement

00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:90%
is a very bad thing and

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.285 align:middle line:84%
it's a bad thing because number
one,

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.354 align:middle line:84%
people judge because they want
to feel powerful.

00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:25.656 align:middle line:84%
So, if I can judge you, I have
the power and

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.325 align:middle line:90%
I can make you less than I am.

00:45:27.325 --> 00:45:29.026 align:middle line:90%
That's judgement.

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:31.462 align:middle line:84%
You can't judge anybody because
you don't know

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.531 align:middle line:84%
what their background is, their
back story.

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:35.232 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, "Talking to Heaven,"

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:38.836 align:middle line:84%
that's my life story, in that
as a young child

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.838 align:middle line:84%
I used to see spirits all the
time.

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.473 align:middle line:84%
I used to know things about
people.

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.275 align:middle line:84%
I used to see colors and lights
around people,

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:46.444 align:middle line:90%
their auras.

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:47.545 align:middle line:90%
That was my childhood.

00:45:47.545 --> 00:45:51.382 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was great and I just
loved it.

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:53.017 align:middle line:90%
I was in my own little world and

00:45:53.017 --> 00:45:56.587 align:middle line:84%
people, I said you see these
kids over in the cemetery?

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.756 align:middle line:84%
I was young and playing with
some friends.

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:00.958 align:middle line:84%
We cut school like good
Catholic boys.

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:02.026 align:middle line:90%
I said to my friends,

00:46:02.026 --> 00:46:03.527 align:middle line:90%
"You see those two little kids?"

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.562 align:middle line:90%
There were like two year olds,

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:05.463 align:middle line:90%
playing in the cemetery.

00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:07.264 align:middle line:84%
They said, "What are you
talking about?"

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.699 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Look, there's a boy
and a girl right there

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.368 align:middle line:90%
"next to that headstone."

00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:12.937 align:middle line:84%
We were cutting school and so
we'd go to cemeteries

00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:14.505 align:middle line:90%
for when we'd cut school.

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:15.406 align:middle line:90%
My friends don't see them.

00:46:15.406 --> 00:46:17.208 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Come on let's look,
let's go over there."

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:19.543 align:middle line:84%
So, we walked over to the
headstone and

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:23.080 align:middle line:84%
the two kids went behind it and
that was the end of it.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.482 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see them anymore.

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:26.917 align:middle line:84%
We read the headstone and it
was a boy and a girl.

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:30.521 align:middle line:84%
Brother and sister who died at
the age of three years old.

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But, to me, it was like, it was
normal.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.960 align:middle line:84%
My childhood has always been a
sense of

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.329 align:middle line:84%
I see spirit, doesn't everybody
see spirit?

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:39.864 align:middle line:84%
Don't you see the lights around
that person?

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:41.465 align:middle line:90%
Don't you see their aura?

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.466 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that?

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.235 align:middle line:90%
Come on, you have to see that.

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:45.936 align:middle line:84%
It was like that sort of thing
and

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:48.339 align:middle line:84%
I think kids are very open
because you have to remember,

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:50.675 align:middle line:84%
they just came from the spirit
world,

00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:52.276 align:middle line:84%
so their mindset is really from
that point of view, right?

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:57.248 align:middle line:84%
Until we drown them around age
eight or nine.

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:59.216 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, you don't see that.

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:02.253 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be smarter than
that.

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:05.823 align:middle line:84%
That's just fantasy, that's
just imagination.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:09.427 align:middle line:84%
It happened in a series of ways
as I think that

00:47:09.427 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the spirit world was
manipulating it all to happen.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.598 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that because I
think we are very influenced

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:16.934 align:middle line:84%
by the other side, no doubt
about it.

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:19.770 align:middle line:84%
In my childhood, there was a
lady named Connie Leaf,

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.605 align:middle line:84%
who I actually dedicated my
first book to,

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:23.140 align:middle line:90%
"Talking to Heaven."

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.376 align:middle line:84%
I was eight years old and I was
selling Easter candy

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:27.445 align:middle line:84%
to the neighbors for Catholic
school

00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:28.813 align:middle line:90%
They used to do that.

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:30.047 align:middle line:90%
They still do.

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.882 align:middle line:84%
And, I was actually walking
down the street

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:35.019 align:middle line:84%
and a lady stops with a 1961
Chevy,

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.587 align:middle line:90%
a red convertible and she said,

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:38.989 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, I have a boy about your
age.

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.124 align:middle line:84%
"We just moved into the
neighborhood.

00:47:40.124 --> 00:47:41.592 align:middle line:84%
"Would you like to come and
meet him?"

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:43.094 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah."

00:47:43.094 --> 00:47:46.664 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember, this was
a lady and my mother

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:49.166 align:middle line:84%
was not available and this lady
was so expressive

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.202 align:middle line:90%
and so out there and so bright.

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.369 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whoa.

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.205 align:middle line:90%
She really was my mentor.

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:55.973 align:middle line:84%
It's always great to see you in
action and

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.742 align:middle line:90%
you're used to being in a room

00:47:57.742 --> 00:48:00.244 align:middle line:84%
and where I see you really
shine is when

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.645 align:middle line:84%
you are in a room like we saw
in that tape

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:03.714 align:middle line:84%
of giving different people
communication.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.316 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no one in this
studio right now,

00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:06.884 align:middle line:84%
I want people to be able to see
that.

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:08.219 align:middle line:90%
It's really great.

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:11.555 align:middle line:90%
You've also had a lot of shows.

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:14.058 align:middle line:84%
We talked about earlier that
you were the creator

00:48:14.058 --> 00:48:15.793 align:middle line:90%
of "The Ghost Whisperer,"

00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:17.762 align:middle line:84%
and there's a picture that we
have of you--

00:48:17.762 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
With Jennifer Love Hewitt, my
Jennifer.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.699 align:middle line:84%
Yes, she was great with that
part, that role.

00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:23.868 align:middle line:84%
She really, I got to meet
Jennifer Love Hewitt,

00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:26.003 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting in a room with
the other producers

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.104 align:middle line:90%
and she said--

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.339 align:middle line:84%
she didn't look at me the whole
time and

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "Why isn't she
looking at me?"

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.008 align:middle line:90%
She would not look at me.

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.309 align:middle line:84%
Then she came up at the end and
she said,

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:34.445 align:middle line:84%
"Excuse me, would you have
lunch with me or dinner?"

00:48:34.445 --> 00:48:35.412 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah."

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.047 align:middle line:84%
The next day we had lunch
together and

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.549 align:middle line:90%
I talked to her and I said,

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:39.416 align:middle line:90%
"Do you know who I am?"

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:40.284 align:middle line:90%
And she said,

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.886 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, yeah, I'm really a big fan.

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
"That's why I couldn't look at
you."

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.889 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:45.589 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.491 align:middle line:84%
And she really, she had a real
curiosity about

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
psychic phenomena, life after
death,

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.061 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world,

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.229 align:middle line:90%
So she really loved it.

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:52.997 align:middle line:90%
Pisces girl

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:54.198 align:middle line:90%
Very very into this.

00:48:54.198 --> 00:48:57.201 align:middle line:84%
We had a wonderful time helping
her to understand

00:48:57.201 --> 00:48:59.603 align:middle line:84%
my line of work, how the spirit
world works,

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.405 align:middle line:84%
what happens to Earth-bound
spirits.

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.541 align:middle line:84%
She really wanted to know all
about it and

00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:05.342 align:middle line:90%
she was a great great student.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.177 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:08.712 align:middle line:84%
Were there miracles that
happened on those sets

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.181 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't be explained?

00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:11.348 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yes, all the time.

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Can you share some stories with
us?

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.751 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:14.985 align:middle line:90%
I can explain, too.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:16.387 align:middle line:90%
We shot at Universal Studios.

00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:17.354 align:middle line:90%
Right around here.

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.023 align:middle line:84%
Right around here, right down
the street.

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:21.826 align:middle line:84%
A couple things happened which
were just very shocking.

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:23.527 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'm aware that spirit's
always around

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:26.096 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing things and
letting things be known

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:27.264 align:middle line:90%
that they are around.

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.899 align:middle line:84%
The first thing happened in the
editing bay

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:31.936 align:middle line:84%
that the four editors that we
had on the show,

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:35.206 align:middle line:84%
their machines would break down
after certain scenes

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:37.708 align:middle line:84%
and the scenes were when the
spirits were released

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:84%
out of the Earth vibration into
the spirit.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.612 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the show, she'd
release them

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:90%
to the higher vibrations.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.484 align:middle line:84%
It would happen after the first
three or four shows

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:50.754 align:middle line:84%
that their editing bank would
break,

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.223 align:middle line:84%
the actual machine would break
down,

00:49:52.223 --> 00:49:53.757 align:middle line:84%
right when she released those
spirits.

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It happened four times in the
first season.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.429 align:middle line:84%
Then we had some spirits who
were there in the room,

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.465 align:middle line:84%
Earth-bound spirits who were
around that whole hallway

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:03.934 align:middle line:84%
where the editing bay was and
we had to release them.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:05.269 align:middle line:90%
So, that was very interesting.

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:08.005 align:middle line:84%
Another time we had an actor
take his mark

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:11.041 align:middle line:84%
and it was Jay Mohr and he had
his mark,

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.644 align:middle line:84%
we were rehearsing and he left
that mark

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:15.646 align:middle line:90%
and a lamp came down and smashed

00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:17.081 align:middle line:90%
right where he was standing.

00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:19.984 align:middle line:84%
So, if he'd been there five
seconds before--

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:21.018 align:middle line:90%
Oh, right.

00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:23.153 align:middle line:84%
So, we had several of those
types of instances.

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:24.255 align:middle line:90%
A lot of different things.

00:50:24.255 --> 00:50:27.124 align:middle line:84%
So, you had to actually work
with many different elements.

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:29.627 align:middle line:84%
I did and I worked a lot with
the writers on the show,

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:30.861 align:middle line:90%
I worked with the producers.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:34.765 align:middle line:84%
I actually did a whole
demonstration for ABC and CBS

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.333 align:middle line:84%
at a producer's house where I
did a demonstration

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:38.669 align:middle line:84%
to show them that this is very
very real.

00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:41.038 align:middle line:84%
Communication with spirit is a
real thing

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.139 align:middle line:90%
and they were shocked.

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.207 align:middle line:90%
They were very shocked.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:45.142 align:middle line:90%
I remember one of the producers,

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:47.511 align:middle line:84%
it came through that she only
had one kidney

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.579 align:middle line:90%
I think it was.

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.414 align:middle line:90%
No, one ovary, one ovary.

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:52.116 align:middle line:84%
And her husband didn't even
know it.

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:53.284 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting right there he
goes,

00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:54.151 align:middle line:90%
"I didn't know that."

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:56.287 align:middle line:84%
And she says, "Yes, I have only
one ovary."

00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:59.623 align:middle line:90%
It was very good details.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.226 align:middle line:84%
So, it opens them up to the
realization

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:04.328 align:middle line:84%
that this is real, this isn't
fantasy.

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:05.729 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is real.

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.265 align:middle line:84%
Yes and the more that we know
that,

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:90%
the more that we recognize that,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.037 align:middle line:84%
when we're thinking or in
traffic or

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:15.105 align:middle line:84%
having actions with other
people,

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:17.741 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that we're just
spirit--

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:19.543 align:middle line:84%
Yes, spirit having a physical
experience.

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:21.578 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences, like
sitting in a car,

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.747 align:middle line:84%
it's a wonderful opportunity
for you

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.215 align:middle line:90%
to remember who you are.

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:84%
When you want to yell at the
person in front of you,

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.954 align:middle line:84%
stop and breathe, go back to
your center.

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:32.222 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity to show
love.

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.924 align:middle line:84%
So, with your thoughts, send
love to that person.

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.326 align:middle line:90%
I say "pink-light" them.

00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Put a pink light around them.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.561 align:middle line:90%
Love them.

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.595 align:middle line:90%
That's a good way.

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.531 align:middle line:84%
We also have a photo of you
with Cesar Milan,

00:51:40.531 --> 00:51:43.901 align:middle line:84%
who I think is an amazing
animal communicator.

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:44.601 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.836 align:middle line:90%
Cesar Milan was on the show.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.204 align:middle line:84%
He did an episode of "Ghost
Whisperer."

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:49.073 align:middle line:84%
He's as tall as I am, which I
love because

00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:51.742 align:middle line:84%
not many people are also five
foot five.

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:53.677 align:middle line:84%
Nice man and he has definitely
a link

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.546 align:middle line:84%
with the animal kingdom, no
doubt about it.

00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:56.780 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.481 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no doubt about it.

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.983 align:middle line:84%
He's a great animal
communicator.

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:02.286 align:middle line:84%
So, his gifts are beyond just
experience.

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.054 align:middle line:84%
I think so, I definitely think
so.

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, let me just jump in here
and say

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:07.224 align:middle line:90%
when animals communicate,

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:08.425 align:middle line:84%
because people often ask me
that,

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:10.427 align:middle line:84%
they come through all the time
and they are

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:12.863 align:middle line:84%
incredible communicators
because when they come through

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
they come through with such
purity and

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.568 align:middle line:90%
such unconditional love.

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:19.103 align:middle line:90%
There's no human stuff in there.

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:20.204 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgements.

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:21.271 align:middle line:90%
There's none of that.

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:22.873 align:middle line:84%
So, what would a message sound
like from an animal?

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:25.242 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I was doing a
demonstration,

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.445 align:middle line:84%
a workshop, I think it was in
Denver,

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:31.415 align:middle line:84%
and the lady is standing there
asking a question.

00:52:31.415 --> 00:52:33.984 align:middle line:84%
Right away I see this horse
come next to her.

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:36.286 align:middle line:84%
It was a brown and white horse
and then I said,

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.957 align:middle line:84%
"There's a man to your left and
he's wearing overalls,"

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:41.825 align:middle line:90%
and I said his name is William.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.528 align:middle line:84%
She said, "That's my horse,
that's my Uncle William.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:45.963 align:middle line:84%
"He bought me a horse when I
was fourteen and

00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:47.731 align:middle line:90%
"that's the horse he bought me."

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:48.999 align:middle line:90%
The horse gave me thoughts,

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.402 align:middle line:84%
like telepathic thoughts about
the ribbons,

00:52:51.402 --> 00:52:54.571 align:middle line:84%
the bridle, about how she used
to take care of the horse

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:57.741 align:middle line:84%
and brush the horse, where the
brush was located still.

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.376 align:middle line:90%
Just these little things.

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:02.479 align:middle line:84%
The amount of love that the
horse wanted to convey,

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:04.181 align:middle line:90%
thanking her, the gratitude.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:06.717 align:middle line:84%
Animals come through, doggies
all the time,

00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:09.620 align:middle line:84%
cats all the time, they come
through with so much love

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.422 align:middle line:90%
and they thank their loved one.

00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:13.223 align:middle line:90%
I've had many people say,

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.992 align:middle line:84%
"I had to put my baby to sleep,
my doggy to sleep."

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:18.128 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful experience of
an example of

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:20.230 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love, because it
came from loving that

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.600 align:middle line:84%
animal so much and that's
again, another lesson.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.601 align:middle line:90%
We always have lessons.

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Every day we have lessons to
learn.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.272 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness, it's true.

00:53:28.272 --> 00:53:30.507 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at things that
way,

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.209 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the pain, the physical
experience

00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:34.144 align:middle line:90%
of putting an animal down versus

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:39.149 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual experience of
looking at the entire soul

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.085 align:middle line:90%
group that you had together,

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:44.054 align:middle line:84%
it really, it takes the edge
off a little bit.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:47.057 align:middle line:84%
It's also, Lisa, I say with
everything in life,

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.792 align:middle line:84%
it's always the motivation
behind the act

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.461 align:middle line:90%
so whenever there's a situation,

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:52.896 align:middle line:84%
what is the motivation for you
behind that situation?

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.199 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming from a pure place
of unconditional love

00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:57.101 align:middle line:84%
trying to do the best you can
do?

00:53:57.101 --> 00:53:57.968 align:middle line:90%
Is that where it's coming from?

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Then you're good, that's where
it should be.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.305 align:middle line:90%
But if it's a place of

00:54:01.305 --> 00:54:03.440 align:middle line:84%
"I need to get ahead, I need to
get over on that person,

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.641 align:middle line:90%
"I need to be--"

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.742 align:middle line:90%
That's not the right space.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.643 align:middle line:90%
It's about inclusion.

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:09.113 align:middle line:84%
It's about being inclusive and
out of that place

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:10.747 align:middle line:90%
of competition and fear.

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:13.117 align:middle line:90%
And treating another person.

00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:13.984 align:middle line:90%
It's the Golden Rule.

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:15.786 align:middle line:84%
I tell you that I love this,
it's so true.

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:17.254 align:middle line:90%
Give another person.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.755 align:middle line:84%
Treat them the way you want to
be treated.

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.057 align:middle line:90%
Say things to them.

00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:22.226 align:middle line:90%
I'm known, in New York probably,

00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:24.027 align:middle line:90%
around the country but,

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:26.096 align:middle line:84%
I always change the energy in a
space.

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.798 align:middle line:90%
I know you do the same thing.

00:54:27.798 --> 00:54:30.033 align:middle line:84%
When I go into a space, like a
Starbucks,

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.502 align:middle line:84%
and they're all standing there
like this,

00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:32.569 align:middle line:90%
pulling up the cups and I'm like

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.238 align:middle line:84%
"Hi, how are you? What are you
doing?"

00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:35.772 align:middle line:90%
I make it fun for them.

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:38.208 align:middle line:84%
I engage them and I think it's
very very important

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.744 align:middle line:84%
that we remember as spiritual
beings,

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.112 align:middle line:90%
we need to engage each other.

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.647 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing the space.

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:44.848 align:middle line:90%
Let's have fun with each other.

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:46.783 align:middle line:84%
I do that with laughter and
some people

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.218 align:middle line:84%
have said, "She giggles too
much,"

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:51.121 align:middle line:84%
but I intentionally bring
laughter in to shift space.

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.923 align:middle line:84%
It brings neutrality into a
room.

00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:54.525 align:middle line:90%
You're exactly right, it does.

00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to laugh and
laughter's healing.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.428 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful healing.

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:90%
We all need that.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:00.664 align:middle line:90%
We do, we do.

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And especially as energy gets
intense and thick

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.768 align:middle line:90%
and if you can bring in--

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:08.172 align:middle line:84%
it looks goofy at first but
it's playful.

00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And it brings that sense of
lightness in.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.176 align:middle line:90%
You know, when I'm on stage,

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:14.645 align:middle line:84%
people look at me and at the
end of my demonstration

00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:16.780 align:middle line:84%
they will come up to me and
I'll be signing books and

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.682 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, "I never realized
you were so funny,

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:20.284 align:middle line:90%
"You're so funny."

00:55:20.284 --> 00:55:21.985 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's just who I am.

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.353 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a sense of
humor.

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:24.288 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:24.288 --> 00:55:26.523 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've been a wonderful
joy to speak with

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and to learn from and I know
that your words

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.929 align:middle line:84%
will resonate with people and
into their hearts,

00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:34.264 align:middle line:84%
because you know truth when it
hits you and

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:35.365 align:middle line:90%
I see you--

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:38.802 align:middle line:84%
just sitting here watching you
in person which is great.

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.471 align:middle line:84%
Because I get to see the color
change in your face

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.040 align:middle line:90%
when truth comes in and--

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.041 align:middle line:90%
Excitement.

00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:44.775 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:55:44.775 --> 00:55:46.543 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed you on the
radio for so long

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:48.412 align:middle line:84%
that I get to finally see you
in person now.

00:55:48.412 --> 00:55:49.179 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.281 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Lisa, I really
appreciate it.

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.217 align:middle line:90%
For sharing your energy with us.

00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:55.886 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you and
everyone who is watching.

00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:57.888 align:middle line:90%
Thank them as well.

00:55:57.888 --> 00:55:58.889 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:55:58.889 --> 00:56:00.924 align:middle line:10%
Then, also, James does
spiritual cruises as well.

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.259 align:middle line:10%
I do spiritual cruises around
the world

00:56:02.259 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:10%
