00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever feel stuck,
or that maybe you've

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.170 align:middle line:84%
started down a pathway and
then halfway through you're

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
just not going in
the right direction?

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're at a
crossroads in your life

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in your relationships
or in your career.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answers may
have to do with karma,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
possibly a past life
that is affecting

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:90%
your current experiences.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is bestselling
author Sandra Anne Taylor.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
She's here to talk about
eternal consciousness,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.385 align:middle line:90%
or in other words, karma.

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:41.885 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA ANNE TAYLOR:
Oh, thank you, Lisa.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love
eternal consciousness

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is another word for karma.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It is what I define
as our soul's knowledge record,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and it holds the karma.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It definitely holds the
memories, the experience,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the good times, the
difficult times.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And because our
eternal consciousness

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
comes back over
and over again, we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
keep coding different things, or
maybe sometimes the same thing

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.437 align:middle line:84%
over and over, like, "I
always attract critical men."

00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That could be a big
karmic issue for some women.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Or, "I can't seem
to keep a job."

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
These patterns that
repeat over and over

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
become a part of
our eternal code,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and the message
is we better learn

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
about what it is that's
in our consciousness

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
so we can shift
it and understand

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
our soul's purpose
for this lesson.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we can move
on to a better life.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how come we
don't remember it, Sandra?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, taking for granted
that there are past lives

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and that we do
reincarnate-- so we're

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.545 align:middle line:90%
starting from that conversation.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.795 align:middle line:84%
We can go to another show
to talk about reincarnation.

00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But for here, we're going to
start from that conversation.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why don't we remember
those tragic experiences

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.561 align:middle line:84%
or being ripped away from our
child or that loss of a loved

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:90%
one?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.442 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we remember that?

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We don't
have conscious memory.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.608 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's a
form of protection

00:02:12.608 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
for-- that our
spirit and our soul

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
plans for us to let go
of because there would

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
be so much information
and so much trauma,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
as well as some--
lots of good stuff

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
too, that it could
just be overwhelming.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.690 align:middle line:84%
However, we do
have memory of it.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We have cellular memory.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
If you were hanged
as a witch, you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
could have arthritis
in your neck.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
If you were stabbed in a battle,
you could have heart problems.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have a cellular
memory, and sometimes this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
is where we look
to find out what

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.497 align:middle line:84%
is this issue in
our body telling us.

00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you noticed that
there are soul groups that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
come in together that-- say,
for example, the witches that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
were burned at the stake
all historically that we

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
understand and we've read about.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it about time for those
souls to have reincarnated?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Is there a time frame?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I absolutely
believe we come together,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
both in our families,
our marital units,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.010 align:middle line:84%
even in our work units to work
out our issues from past stuff.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that as a
planet, we come together.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are a lot
of people on the planet

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
now who have been
persecuted for past life

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
religious or spiritual
devotions and practices.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were brought--
I know I was,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just getting
a read on you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.691 align:middle line:90%
I know you were.

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And we were
brought together.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are
millions of us now.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We were brought
together at this time

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to awaken our own
individual awareness

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual path, but
then as a group, awaken

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of the planet.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.912 align:middle line:84%
I believe Gena, my
producer, is in the same--

00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:52.995 align:middle line:90%
we were in the same tribe.

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:53.703 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh yes.

00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:57.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some other
good witch tribe.

00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your story,
about how you started off

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
on your path of
discovering karma.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
How did you know that
this was something

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that was going to come up
for you time and time again

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
as an adult?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I was actually
interested in it as a child,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
in spite of being raised in
Catholic schools all my life.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.151 align:middle line:84%
I heard that it was some
foreign, bizarre thing

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.442 align:middle line:90%
and we shouldn't believe in it.

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:19.805 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.795 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But it was
interesting to me.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But I actually went
into it in adulthood.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I had a private
psychological practice

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and was working on helping
people change their thoughts,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
change their emotions,
get out of their traumas.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I was
introduced to quantum physics.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
principles of quantum physics

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
could be applied to
the human experience.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And once we shifted
our consciousness--

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.909 align:middle line:84%
which is really a deeper,
deeper understanding of what

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:90%
the law of attraction is.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
There are many laws, and it's
our whole consciousness moves

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:90%
out in front of us.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not just wish
for something and you

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:90%
believe it and you'll get it.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Your whole consciousness.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if that holds any
self-hatred, karmic stuff,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
different things like that,
that moves out and creates

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:90%
your destiny.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that further.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.128 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean,
our consciousness

00:05:13.128 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:90%
goes in front of us?

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Each of us has
an individual identity,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and we store consciousness
information from past lives,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
but we also hold
information from this life.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we live in a
constant state of-- or even

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
not constant, but
really committed

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
state of self-criticism, that
creates our personal energy

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is pretty much accepted
in the quantum physical world

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
creates reality.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
That applies to the
individual person as well.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm conscious about being
negative or faulty in some way,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness will
move out and create

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
a reality of attracting people
and situations where they

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
believe, or it
proves that I might

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.146 align:middle line:84%
be negative or
faulty in some way.

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's
not your thoughts

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:90%
that create your reality at all.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.621 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, your thoughts
are part of your consciousness.

00:06:05.621 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So are your emotions.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So are your belief systems.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So is any embedded trauma that
you don't even know about.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's take, for
example, if you

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
want to create
something like wealth.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Usually, that's what people
want to create is money.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They would take that in their
consciousness and they would

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
put it out in front of
their aura or future or--

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's more than just
thinking about the wealth.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Your consciousness
is largely created

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
by your perception of yourself
and your place and power

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.005 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:06:41.005 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --and also
of the world itself.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
manifest and create

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness of
wealth, you have

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:84%
to see yourself as
deserving of wealth.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And see, a lot of people don't.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a very key issue.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They want it, want it,
want it, and they see it.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:90%
They visualize it.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But on some deeper
level, they might not

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
sense they're deserving.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
They must see the
world as abundant

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and that it's available to them.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And they must see themself
as capable of producing it.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get all this
together in your consciousness,

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
it just projects an irresistible
manifestation and magnetism

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.439 align:middle line:84%
go backwards for a little

>>LISA: OK.

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell by
talking to someone

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:90%
what their karmic past is?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: If I tune in to them--
and I do this on my radio show.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:90%
I give karmic readings.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I give energy readings.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I can tell where things
are blocked in our chakras,

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
if you have a past life
that might have blocked

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
your sense of-- OK, I'm getting
you have had a difficulty.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
This has been an
important life for you

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're in the
field of speaking publicly,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.089 align:middle line:84%
and you have had a past life
where you were shut down--

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:90%
where you were shut down.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.861 align:middle line:84%

See, and that's what happens.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
We get physical
stuff in the center,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.689 align:middle line:84%

that chakra, is located.

It comes through.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.151 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a lot
of history on karma.

00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's, of course, there's
many ancient traditions that

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:90%
believe in karma.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's the many people

>>TAYLOR: The conference

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But he said that John the
Baptist is Elias come back.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So even he says-- and Elias
was an Old Testament figure.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is very well
documented in Indian records.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in India, they
even used a karmic case

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:90%

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
in a practical way, the
power of your past lives,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: OK.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So the reason
we look into past lives

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.449 align:middle line:90%
is to see, how can I clear this?

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots of ways
that you can clear it.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we have to realize

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is that this is kind
of weird, and it's

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
hard for the human mind
to wrap itself around,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but all time exists
at the same time.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
time-space continuum.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So that stuff that
happened in the past

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
is still vibrating at
a different resonance.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we can go
back and clear it.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:90%
That's very liberating for us.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So what I have
taught people to do

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is take the information
they get about past life

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and rescript it.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
hanged as a witch,

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.569 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself in front
of the judge or whatever,

00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and they say, you're free to go

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you see yourself
going through that life

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%

Can you, in that situation,
start to unravel that karma?

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Clear it?

You can clear

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to, and you
need more repetitions

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%

if you've been

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The closer it is, and
especially within this life,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
it's a little
harder to rescript.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:90%
But you can do it.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to repeat it.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%

yourself and your intentions

to supporting the changes.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So like you, where

how to speak up and
speak your truth,

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.891 align:middle line:84%
you had to devote yourself
to that to shift that karma.

00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:53.389 align:middle line:90%

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.457 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual choice

00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've learned a

about creating a karmic loop.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So say if karma is a
circle, and then there's

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
a missing part of that
circle that just happens

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to be missing, can
you do a visualization

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.836 align:middle line:84%
to actually close the circle
and complete the karma?

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
You can put people
in your karmic group.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.985 align:middle line:84%
You can take people out
of your karmic group.

00:14:22.985 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It all has
to do with intention

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the person and
knowing the kind of life

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Your soul comes back
with a lesson to learn.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, if
we learned the lesson,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.999 align:middle line:90%
we get done with that issue.

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
When you learn to
speak up, you don't

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:90%
have to be shut down anymore.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
When you stop
criticizing yourself,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be-- attract
critical people anymore.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just a beautiful,
elegant system.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.465 align:middle line:84%
And so when we create the
intention, I want to speak up,

00:14:57.465 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to be loving
to myself, and I only

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
want people who are loving to
me in my group, in my loop,

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
in my karma for my
next life-- or even

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my

>>TAYLOR: Actually, I had
my psychological practice

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, and I would be
doing regressions with clients,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.265 align:middle line:84%
and the case is in my
book about the hidden part

00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:50.267 align:middle line:84%
of your past lives with clients
who had pre-verbal memory loss,

00:15:50.267 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was just trying
to get them back

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to the ages of two or three
where they had no memory,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and they would
spontaneously go back.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a good

So then I'm sure you've

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
with the situation
of a parent who

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
loses a child, a baby at

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- Have people like

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
what was the karmic debt
that I needed to pay on this,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.685 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little cautious about
using the term "karmic

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
debt" because it's just
that people think that they

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
did something wrong and
then they owe for it.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't want to do that.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's more
karmic awareness.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:90%
What is the lesson?

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And children come in to
our lives with an awareness

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that they might pass
early because there

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
was a lesson for
the whole group.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a lot
of lessons for young,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
like two, three,
four-year-old children

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to learn in terms
of being more loving

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and that because they're in
that childhood innocence.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But they bring a lesson
to their parents.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The important thing is
not to fault yourself

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:90%
if something bad happens.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
misconceptions, what

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I call the lies of attraction.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That when people think

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
bad happen to themselves,
they think-- and I have gotten

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
so many emails, thousands
of emails when people

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.066 align:middle line:90%
get bad stuff happening to them.

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They say, what did
I do to create this?

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.981 align:middle line:90%
Especially with their children.

00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:90%
My child has leukemia.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:90%
My child has autism.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:90%
What did I do to create this?

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there was
someone on the Larry King Show

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
who Larry King asked, well,
what about that girl who

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
was kidnapped and
molested and killed?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the guy actually said,
well, it's the parents' fault.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And for months after
that, I got emails.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to clear it up
that there are cycles of life

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:90%
that we need to go through.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the understanding
of our eternal soul

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that the loss of the child,
although I can't even

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
understand how
painful that could be,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
our eternal soul

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
back and be with us.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to look

When you think-- we want to

But actually, the soul longs
to come back and experience

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful things on earth,
experience wonderful things

>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

So you say that there

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.764 align:middle line:90%
of karmic experience.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are those?

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The first
is repetition.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
When we experience
the same thing

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again,
it becomes coded deeply.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And we keep coming back into a
life where we have the option

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
to repeat yet again.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.284 align:middle line:90%
So this is addiction.

00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Addiction is repeated a lot.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Relationship.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Relationships
are often repeated.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Financial crisis.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Financial crisis
and even financial success.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So repetition is one
of the driving forces.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The next
is compensation.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's like
a pendulum swing.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:90%
That's like a pendulum swing.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So I am in the potato famine
in Ireland and I'm starving

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to death, and I come back as
someone who just cannot be

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.857 align:middle line:84%
satisfied no matter
how much I eat.

00:22:36.857 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
So I get a weight problem.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then I resent
that and feel ashamed,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.794 align:middle line:84%
so I come back as somebody
who was born in Haiti

00:22:45.794 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and there's not enough food.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's like back
and forth and back

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
until we can let go
of the attachment.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:90%
And then there's retribution.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds like
punishment, but it really isn't.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It's about what I said
about learning the lesson.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:84%
If I have done something
to somebody else

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and it has been hurtful, or
it has created difficulties

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
for them, I need-- it's
like paying it forward.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Retribution is like
paying back, but it's

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
more like paying it
forward to yourself.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I need to experience that to
see what it feels like so I can

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.201 align:middle line:84%
make a more honoring and
enlightened choice next time.

00:23:24.201 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
listening and they

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.292 align:middle line:84%
have discovered that they're in
this repetition phase of karma,

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
where they're recreating the
same thing over and over again

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing
pain, how do you

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.794 align:middle line:84%
rewrite that karmic
code for this lifetime?

00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's one
of the things where

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to decide
that I'm going

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to support what the
behavior is here.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I know I'm hurtful
to somebody else,

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I have to look at what that is.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
For most people who are hurtful
or abusive or critical even,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:84%
the need to do those things
comes from a fear base.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
People like that would never
admit that it's fear-based,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's power mongering.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The truly confident,
comfortable,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
genuinely powerful,
authentically powerful

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
people don't have to hurt
others to feel better

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we need is to
find out the lesson

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and say, wait a minute, I
don't have to live fear-based.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I can see that other
people are my equal.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.727 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to hurt
them any longer.

00:24:20.727 --> 00:24:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.809 align:middle line:84%

if you're realizing
that that's the case,

either the feast or the

>>TAYLOR: You have to

00:24:38.238 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the feast part,
whatever indulgence it is--

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and that can be things
like alcoholism.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
It can be sex.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.499 align:middle line:84%
People go from being
virgins to prostitutes.

00:24:48.499 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Addictions.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and things like that.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You can just say,
OK, there's an attachment here

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and a longing here.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%

over-attachment back

to longing.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to figure out
kind of where you're at

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and say I can
release the longing

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%

without the sex,

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or without the alcohol or
the food, whatever it is,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
or I can release the
attachment and find happiness

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.347 align:middle line:84%

But you can also look
at the past life,

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and a rescripting is actually
a process where you meditate

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and see the past life, where
I see myself as in the potato

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:84%
famine, and all of
a sudden, my friends

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.575 align:middle line:84%
and I are on a ship to America
and we have beautiful harvests

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:38.327 align:middle line:84%
and lots of food and we live
a long, healthy, happy life.

00:25:38.327 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you go into that?

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.904 align:middle line:84%
I know that as a therapist
you can guide people

00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:43.445 align:middle line:84%
into that type of
regression, but how

00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
do you guide yourself into it?

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, you
can meditate on it.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a guided
rescription in my book,

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.689 align:middle line:84%
"The Hidden Power of Your Past
Lives," on the CD and a script.

00:25:53.689 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can do any--
you can do it yourself.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:84%
You can just-- some people
have trouble meditating,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
especially if they've
been persecuted

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:90%
for their spiritual practices.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they really
need to do that.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But for those people,
I say even just

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:84%
write a narrative where I
see myself getting on a ship,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and we land in a beautiful
place and have a big farm

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.934 align:middle line:84%
and have lots of food, and I
grow old and healthy and happy.

00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
write a narrative,

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.997 align:middle line:90%
and that'll shift it, too.

00:26:19.997 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So say, for example, if
you have an addiction,

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
you can write a script of
you not having the addiction

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and go back into a
meditation, reading

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
or maybe record the script
and play it back to yourself?

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: You absolutely can.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely can.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's not
necessary to know the past life

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to break the code, which is
what drove me to write my most

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
recent book, "Your Quantum
Breakthrough Code."

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got this--
I was working with someone

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.695 align:middle line:84%
who had some self-esteem
problems, very significant,

00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:59.312 align:middle line:84%
and we had worked with
cognitive therapy, meditation,

00:26:59.312 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of things, even
some past life stuff.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And she really made
a lot of advances,

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%
but she just kept stuck
in the business element.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
She didn't see
herself as capable.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to bed
one night, and I said,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
easy for Peggy

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:90%
to do to change her thoughts.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had this dream
where a spirit came to me

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and showed me this position
about putting your fingers

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and raising your--
closing your eyes

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and raising them and saying
some decoding statements.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I decode fear.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I decode self-judgment, and
then breathing and releasing

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and letting it go, and
then to code something new

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.505 align:middle line:84%
and do the same thing
with just the right hand.

00:27:37.505 --> 00:27:40.402 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That I feel
what you want to feel?

00:27:40.402 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: What you want to
do-- and this is the code.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And you close your eyes.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Just try this.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel
something right away.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath
and look up at that point

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
you're touching and just
say, I code strength.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I code power.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I code joy.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to feel
the tingling in your head

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and even in the
palms of your hands.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And then you release it.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.495 align:middle line:84%
It's very powerful,
super easy, and I've

00:28:07.495 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:84%
been teaching that for
about three years now.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to teach
it before I actually

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
wrote about it because
I wanted to make sure--

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Experiences of it.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.577 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Just incredible.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.975 align:middle line:84%
People who were not able
to find love, people

00:28:18.975 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
who were not-- and now this
woman that I was talking

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
about with the
capabilities at work,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:84%
she is now an executive in a
very big international company.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.634 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:28:30.634 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So you don't always even
have to know the past life.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
You just need to know,
what's the problem?

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
What do I keep
hitting up against?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can decode those
patterns and create new ones.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is just by
creating repetitive pain

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.367 align:middle line:84%
that you realize you might
have a karmic pattern there,

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can go in
and you can actually

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.605 align:middle line:90%
break the pattern of it.

00:28:53.605 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.531 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's very,
very important.

00:28:56.531 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.779 align:middle line:84%
Well we're going to
take a look at a video

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
here of you talking a
little bit about what

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.259 align:middle line:90%
you call encoded consciousness.

00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.215 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's take a look.

00:29:05.215 --> 00:29:07.155 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:07.155 --> 00:29:09.524 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.524 --> 00:29:10.065 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Hi.

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm Sandra Taylor,
and today we're

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
talking about your
eternal consciousness.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
In the scientific
world, it's well

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
known that consciousness
creates reality.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for
the individual as well.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness
creates your reality.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't
realize, however,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is that their consciousness,
their own individual personal

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, is eternal.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the
beginning of time

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and has moved through
several lifetimes

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:90%
to get to where we're at today.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
What happens during
those lifetimes

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness
becomes encoded.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists define
the word consciousness

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:90%
as a field of information.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness is a field
of information about yourself.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:84%
What is hidden to you
is the information

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that comes from past
life events, emotions,

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.304 align:middle line:90%
and conclusions.

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
new book, "The Hidden

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Power of Your Past
Lives," is about.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It's revealing what is encoded
in your eternal consciousness

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:84%
so that you can change
what has happened

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and change your reactions.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This will dynamically change
the results of this life.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
See, we code from emotionally
charged experiences,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
whether in this
life or past lives.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The more emotionally charged an
experience is, the more strong

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
the code is going to be
in our personal drive

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and in what motivates us today.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So if I have had a loss of
love in a previous life,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I might think that it's
unsafe for me to love now.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And though personally
I'm looking for love,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:84%
my karmic intention
may be to stay safe.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
What I need to do is go
back and change the code.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Change that karmic intention.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is all possible
because the time-space continuum

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
says that all time
exists at the same time.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to go
back, change the past,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and recode ourself for a more
positive, more optimistic view

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
of what we expect in this
life and in the future.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:43.807 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.807 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there more
exercises like that we just

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.723 align:middle line:84%
learned in the video
that you could teach us

00:31:47.723 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that could either help
unlock our karmic codes

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.475 align:middle line:90%
or help us move into the future?

00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well,
one of the things

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us
stuck is just being

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:90%
always striving and nervous.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.635 align:middle line:84%
And in that dream where I
was taught these positions

00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and taught the coding
statements and the decoding--

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, there were more?

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.368 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: There
was one other dream

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that I was told was
called the peace process.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's so simple.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
You hook your two
little fingers together.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you put them in
your lap, what happens--

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
these are the heart meridians,
if you study acupuncture.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they go up the
outside of your arm

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:90%
into your heart chakra.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And look, it creates
the shape of a heart.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so you
take a deep breath,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and again, you close your
eyes and raise them upwards,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and you just let
all your worries go.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in this position,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
it's next to
impossible to worry.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't you feel peaceful?

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Isn't it?

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.255 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:32:42.255 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's
very hard to worry

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:90%
when you're in this position.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.094 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now, what that
does is instantly shift

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
our consciousness.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand
that their whole life force

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
energy is the source
of their results.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you're always
striving, always nervous,

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:90%
always worried--

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Negative?

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
What about being
always negative?

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And negative about yourself
or the world or whatever,

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.720 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create that
as a life force vibration.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most
attractive resonances

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is peace, because so
few people have it.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so just sitting in that
position and deep breathing,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and especially when
you point your eyes up

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to your sixth chakra, it
just brings so much peace.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could that help you
get refocused on your goals?

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk a
lot about quantum success

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and what is that.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:41.945 align:middle line:90%

That is interesting.

So if you are losing focus or
you want to regain your focus,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
can you do this and
just focus and get back

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.436 align:middle line:90%

00:33:54.436 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

If someone's really
annoying you,

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:84%
you just release them, let
them go, and then just do this.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.087 align:middle line:84%
And you can really just
get calmed down, even

00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
when you're very agitated.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:08.961 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about for people

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.949 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Say, hook your fingers

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ever try

at least you're planting the

And if you were to do
a brain scan on her,

There's less neurotransmitters

the whole purpose

If it's really a

but I have that relationship
with my daughter.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.649 align:middle line:84%
She and I have talked in

difficult experience that
happened to us in a past life

that she and I remember,

physically ripped away from her

And every now and then,
that memory will surface,

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%

tightly, or I'll hold on to her

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:84%
really tightly because we're

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:90%
You can do some cleansing.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:90%
I feel it in the heart chakra.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can do some spinning of
the chakra, chakra meditation.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, there
is a tendency for energy

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to get stuck in
certain energy centers.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we've had a physical
thing or an emotional trauma

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:84%
like a broken heart, stuff
can get stuck in that chakra.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And an easy process is to
just meditate and visualize

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.359 align:middle line:84%
the chakra spinning
counterclockwise--

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Counterclockwise?

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --first
and getting rid

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.482 align:middle line:84%

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then it slows down

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:90%
as if your body is the clock.

And you just see it filling with
light, and the light's turning,

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's going
faster and faster.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the light
fills your body.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can then do
some affirmations.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can also decode fear
and attachment and longing,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and code trust and
peace and belief

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:84%
in the eternity of
your relationship.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:84%

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.407 align:middle line:84%

00:41:00.407 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.112 align:middle line:84%
You can sit together
and do the decoding.

00:41:03.112 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of suggested
statements in the book,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:84%
but I would suggest
decoding fear of loss,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:84%
fear of abandonment, fear of
separation, any kind of fear,

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and then code trust
and peace of mind

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and a deep sense of
our eternal connection

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and our eternal love.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting,
because the first decade of me

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
being a working mom,
it tore me apart,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
probably from the
perspective that I

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
couldn't justify
leaving her ever.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.939 align:middle line:84%
But yet, I still have this
career path and this passion,

00:41:35.939 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's more than work for me.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So with this understanding,
that has helped

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:84%
me understand that level of
guilt for the first 10 years

10 years ago.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I spent 10 years

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.965 align:middle line:84%
with guilt of being
a working mom.

00:41:54.965 --> 00:41:56.340 align:middle line:84%

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.439 align:middle line:90%
trauma.

00:42:00.439 --> 00:42:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And even though it

with death or complete loss,
every time you get in the car,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:84%
it's like the surface, it just
bubbles up to the surface.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And you just have
this gnawing sensation

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.340 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety and angst
and fear and loss.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.916 align:middle line:84%

hearing spirit?

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Have you been a medium?

>>TAYLOR: I do hear spirit.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.417 align:middle line:90%
I pick up spirit.

Sometimes I don't get the names.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll get some presence
of a relationship.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And I get intuitive readings.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I can see chakras.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:90%
I can get past lives.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I see which angels and ascended
masters are working with you,

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.937 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:42:51.937 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Earlier we
pulled the card Metatron.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so these cards are used
to help people assist them

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:84%
with maybe doing
readings, right?

00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.966 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:42:59.966 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They're oracle cards,
and they tell you

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:84%
where you're at now, what
your energy is doing now,

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and what you can expect from
the future based on that energy.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:90%
So we pulled Metatron for you.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.650 align:middle line:84%
He is the angel of the
sixth chakra in my vision,

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and he's also the record keeper.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not surprising that
you would, as a new author,

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:84%
would pull the record
keeper, and as someone

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
who works with your
own intuitive voice,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:84%
would get someone
from the sixth chakra.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And Uriel also would--
and I'm feeling

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Uriel's presence with you.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.919 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing more
blank books, so there

00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:38.168 align:middle line:90%
are more books in your future.

00:43:38.168 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:90%

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The angel

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, many

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I see-- and you know,
it's interesting

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because angels are light
beings, so they don't really

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:90%
have a gender.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Some I never see
as the opposite.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, Michael is always man.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.915 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
so much strength,

00:44:01.915 --> 00:44:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and he's the angel of the first
chakra-- stability, strength,

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:90%
security, that type of thing.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Uriel is the fire
of God, and she--

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I see her more as
female, some as male.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason some of them
come in different genders

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
energy they bring.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The strength, or the--

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Male is yag and
action and that type of thing.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Yin is passive, creative,
that type of thing.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So passive, reflective.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Yang is creative.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So Uriel is the seventh
chakra and bringing messages

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
from spirit and opening up this
pipeline to the spirit realm.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:84%

resonant energy.

the law of paradoxical

the more that urgent,
needy vibration will

push the goal you

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.150 align:middle line:84%
the paradox, or the

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Because the energy is so strong?

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The
energy is agitated.

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you project an
agitated consciousness,

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:84%
it actually fragments your

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the universe says,
we want you to be happy now.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're desperate, you're
in a mind state of saying,

I cannot be happy without,
fill in the blank-- the guy,

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
the published book, the

the big house,
the car, whatever.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you're thinking,
I can't be happy without,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that means you're translating
it to, I can't be happy now.

So the universe is like,
why send her anything?

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.355 align:middle line:90%
She can't be happy.

00:46:27.355 --> 00:46:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.842 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
that desire, that yearning

00:46:31.842 --> 00:46:33.800 align:middle line:84%
of really wanting something
where you're really

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.470 align:middle line:84%
focused on it, and
pushing it away?

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:37.515 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:46:37.515 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, you
know, I like to point out

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a big difference
between the word

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.420 align:middle line:90%
"desperation" and determination.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.680 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it in the energy.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You can live in determination
and peaceful persistence,

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.620 align:middle line:84%
peaceful pursuit of your goal,
where I can be happy now,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and part of my happiness
is the work on the goal.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that creates
paradoxical intent is people

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:90%
only have their eye on the goal.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And they want to be
the famous writer,

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.920 align:middle line:84%
the millionaire
salesperson, whatever it is,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
don't want to do

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.340 align:middle line:90%
the cold calls or the writing.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
they want the outcome

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:90%
without the process.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:22.370 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
peaceful determination,

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.700 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I'm going to
find joy in the process.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find
stuff that I can

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.590 align:middle line:84%
do that will resonate
with that end result

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and bring me joy
right now as I do it.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.217 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So just for example,
in the movie "The Secret"

00:47:39.217 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
where you put the red
car in your intention,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.860 align:middle line:84%
you see the red car
everywhere, you're

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.020 align:middle line:84%
saying that it's not
necessarily about the red car,

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's about the journey
and the way that you

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.649 align:middle line:90%
get to that red car.

00:47:49.649 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end, it might
not even be the red car at all.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:55.119 align:middle line:84%
It's about the journey
to that red car?

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It is the
journey, and it's

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.450 align:middle line:84%
creating happiness
in your journey.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, you can say, yes.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we come to this earth
to experience wonderful things,

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.624 align:middle line:90%
as we talked about.

00:48:07.624 --> 00:48:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Our soul wants to
have the great things.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing
wrong with having

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.220 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, abundant wealth
and wonderful romance

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.050 align:middle line:90%
and love in our lives.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But when we place that
as a source of happiness,

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:27.190 align:middle line:84%
we're losing our soul
and our life experience

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.110 align:middle line:90%
as our source of happiness.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we start from.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:35.930 align:middle line:84%
When we get in that
mindset that every day is

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be happy and then
we visualize the car-- not

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.410 align:middle line:90%
just visualize the car.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.345 align:middle line:84%
Got to visualize
ourselves in the car.

00:48:43.345 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's another thing,
another mistake people make.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
You gotta see yourself
in the experience,

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.022 align:middle line:84%
but also see yourself
doing the stuff that's

00:48:51.022 --> 00:48:51.980 align:middle line:90%
going to get you there.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.869 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So rather than
just seeing the car,

00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:55.285 align:middle line:84%
because it's still
outside of you,

00:48:55.285 --> 00:48:57.490 align:middle line:84%
you need to see
yourself-- so, in the job,

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:00.650 align:middle line:84%
in the position that you want
to be in working from that,

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.750 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship being
fulfilled and happy.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And in today.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.570 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do today?

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
If I have to make
10 cold calls, I'm

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.300 align:middle line:90%
going to enjoy doing that today.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I like to visualize my
results not of the future,

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:17.320 align:middle line:90%
but my results of the day.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.110 align:middle line:90%
And those are emotional.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you still have karma
that you're working out now.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, and I think that
pretty much as long as we're

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:84%
alive, we have two karmic
elements-- our own issues

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and lessons, even
residual pieces of it,

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and our service to others.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.634 align:middle line:84%
So I'm working on the
service to others part.

00:49:36.634 --> 00:49:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, like
the books that--

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.880 align:middle line:84%
doing this interview with
you, the books that I write,

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:84%
having my sessions with
clients and speaking

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I love that about
my life, and that's

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.870 align:middle line:90%
part of my karmic intention.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Karma is not just punishment.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It can be wonderful.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, people
think that those

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of us in the metaphysical world,
especially if we've been there

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:84%
for eons, don't have
anything to work on.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But trust me, we
have physical issues.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We have relationship
issues, family stuff,

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:19.470 align:middle line:84%
things that come up that
aren't necessarily major life--

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not dealing with
this chronically

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:22.800 align:middle line:90%
for decades at a time.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But you still have to go into
that soul place, that soul

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:29.050 align:middle line:84%
point of view, and say, OK,
what is the lesson here?

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And how do I want
to bring honoring

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.811 align:middle line:84%
to myself and the
other people involved?

00:50:33.811 --> 00:50:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So could
it be fair that you

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
could look at any
issue in your life,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
relationships or finances,

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can start to solve
those issues through looking

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.640 align:middle line:84%
at the karmic
relationship with it?

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: You absolutely can.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even have
to know what the karma is.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.590 align:middle line:84%
If you see a pattern going
on and on in your life,

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you pretty much
know that something

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:56.330 align:middle line:84%
has happened in a
past that you are now

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.230 align:middle line:84%
being given an
opportunity to change.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To resolve.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you call
encoded consciousness.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:01.753 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:51:01.753 --> 00:51:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's encoded
into our consciousness

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and coming through.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.070 align:middle line:90%
So karma with other people.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.810 align:middle line:84%
People have been
through maybe divorce

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.660 align:middle line:84%
or difficult
relationship issues.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Can you do some type of a
conscious karmic disconnection

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:84%
with a spouse or a partner
that you are separating from?

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Is there a conscious divorce?

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there is.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You can't change
the other person's attachment

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to you, but you can change
your attachment to the person.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing is
ventilating all the feelings.

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
misconception

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:84%
about the laws of attraction is
never have a negative feeling,

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:84%
never have a negative
thought, which is crazy.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:90%
We're human beings.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We have the negative
feelings and thoughts.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%
If we don't vent,
they just sit with us

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a part of
that life force energy.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So I take a journal
and I write a letter.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Dear so and so, what the hell
were you thinking, whatever.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But then at every entry, you end
it with some releasing affir--

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'm releasing
your toxic energy

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reclaiming my power
and my peace of mind now.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
vent your feelings.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Because what people don't
understand is negative feelings

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:13.120 align:middle line:90%
are still attachment.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.890 align:middle line:84%
If I'm enraged at
my first husband,

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I am still attached to that man.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.690 align:middle line:84%
If I'm still
attached, I probably

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.960 align:middle line:84%
have to do something
again with him.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're just inviting that
back into your next life.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.474 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So you have
to get the feelings out

00:52:26.474 --> 00:52:30.639 align:middle line:84%
so you can look at it,
laugh at it, say bye-bye.

00:52:30.639 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Get the
feelings out in terms

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of being resolved with them.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.282 align:middle line:90%
Just vent it--

00:52:35.282 --> 00:52:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --even if the
other person isn't.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because there
are two important pieces

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:90%
of venting emotions.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.230 align:middle line:90%
You get the energy.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrational reality
in our energy field.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So you get the anger out, the
fear, the hatred, whatever.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you're
not toxifying your energy

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:54.230 align:middle line:90%
because you're getting it out.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you end it with
reclaiming your power

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and your self-esteem,
that type of thing.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But then you also look at
the conclusions and say,

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to believe
those conclusions.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I have anger at a father
who constantly criticized me,

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I get it out and
say, wait a minute.

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:10.630 align:middle line:84%
What are my con--
I'm still concluding

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.330 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not valuable.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have to change the
conclusions, work on that.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And that lets the final
piece of attachment go.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see
how this has a lot

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.124 align:middle line:84%
to do with therapy
and with psychology,

00:53:23.124 --> 00:53:25.040 align:middle line:84%
because as you're looking
back into the karma,

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.380 align:middle line:84%
it brings back certain
psychological attachments

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:90%
in this current time.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's so
transparent when you really

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.599 align:middle line:90%
start looking at it.

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
other ways that you

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:84%
can-- other than writing a
letter or talking it out,

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that you-- a tool
or a technique?

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Talking to
somebody, a friend

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:47.300 align:middle line:84%
or a therapist, physical
activity, swinging a bat,

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:90%
hitting a ball, whatever it is.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Movement, that gets it out as
long as you're expressing--

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a
metaphorical intention

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that that energy is
moving outward from me

00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.624 align:middle line:90%
and I'm releasing it.

00:53:59.624 --> 00:54:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you do workshops
where you actually

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:05.726 align:middle line:84%
have people go through their
karmic background, so to speak?

00:54:05.726 --> 00:54:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Do a regression.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
different types of--

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can do
a group regression?

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh yes.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What happens in those?

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Surprisingly,
many, many people

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.895 align:middle line:84%
get-- some people
don't get anything

00:54:18.895 --> 00:54:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because they're too nervous
about being in a group.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.400 align:middle line:90%
But most people get something.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be surprised at
how many people actually

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.730 align:middle line:90%
get the same thing.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Especially if you
create-- the kind of regression

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I do is focused regression.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So you think about
something that you

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.230 align:middle line:90%
want to find an issue with.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes teach a
class where I say, OK, we're

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.160 align:middle line:84%
going to all see-- look
at a life where we might

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.350 align:middle line:90%
have come back, been together.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how many--
and you start asking people,

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're, I did that.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.622 align:middle line:84%
So like 20%, 30%, 40%,
50% of the people.

00:54:58.622 --> 00:55:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Will randomly
wind up in the same room?

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: In the same room.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.505 align:middle line:90%
It's not random.

00:55:03.505 --> 00:55:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's karmic.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's karmic.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:07.725 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen it over
and over and over again.

00:55:07.725 --> 00:55:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And you've done these
workshops all over the world?

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:10.599 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh yeah.

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:12.744 align:middle line:84%
All over the world
for the last 20 years.

00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how interesting.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.814 align:middle line:84%
And they just wind up in the
same lecture at the same time.

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.230 align:middle line:84%
They sign up for
it ahead of time.

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:25.160 align:middle line:84%
How much of our lives do we live
by that type of karmic code?

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Most people, it's
like a large majority of it.

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And until you start
really working on it,

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:32.940 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a driving force.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Our encoded consciousness, even
if you don't look at the karma,

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:84%
what is encoded in terms
of our reactive patterns--

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.010 align:middle line:84%
the things where we just
respond emotionally,

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.920 align:middle line:84%
the same response over and
over-- the authoritarian figure

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.130 align:middle line:84%
or this type of situation, and
we get the same response, fear

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:54.100 align:middle line:90%
or anger or shutting down.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a reactive pattern,
a part of our code.

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.092 align:middle line:90%
And it drives 90% of our lives.

00:56:00.092 --> 00:56:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Behavior.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely sure it does.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And it could be unconscious.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Most of it is all unconscious.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So can somebody find
out, for example,

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.730 align:middle line:84%
if they have a strong
affinity with the Asian arts,

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.230 align:middle line:84%
yet they're from Kentucky,
and they most likely had

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.917 align:middle line:84%
a past life in
some form of Asia?

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.910 align:middle line:84%
If you have an affinity
for or a revulsion

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to some place, some
architecture, some type

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of locale or geography,
some type of food,

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:33.980 align:middle line:90%
you know that you--

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.563 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Water.

00:56:34.563 --> 00:56:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --have a past
life-- water, mountains,

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.610 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- you know that
you've had a past life there.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Chances are, if
you have no feeling

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:84%
at all for a certain place, you
don't have a past life there.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a strong
connection with or longing,

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you've had something
probably good there,

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and if you have a
revulsion to or allergies

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to the type of food-- I'm
severely allergic to curry.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.395 align:middle line:84%
I know something horrible
happened to me in India,

00:57:01.395 --> 00:57:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and I don't want to find out.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:09.779 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen patterns where
people have died drowning,

00:57:09.779 --> 00:57:10.820 align:middle line:90%
or those types of things?

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That's another one of
the repetition things.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.700 align:middle line:84%
People will pass from the
same type of experience.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not the
exact same type of thing,

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.270 align:middle line:84%
they might have, like I said--
like if you have drowned

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:30.189 align:middle line:84%
in the past, you might
have asthma in this life.

00:57:30.189 --> 00:57:30.980 align:middle line:90%
That type of thing.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So it might be
ameliorated as you go on.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But you can work on
that and rescript it

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.290 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to have even
the physiological residue.

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And rescript it by
going maybe back into the pool?

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And you don't drown.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You swim to the side,
and you get out.

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Feeling safe and
being in that moment.

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Feeling safe, perfectly
safe, and just

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:55.690 align:middle line:84%
script yourself into
that conversation

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:57.720 align:middle line:84%
until you feel that it's
starting to release.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.447 align:middle line:84%
You can reverse the chakra
and then recorrect it.

00:58:01.447 --> 00:58:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Lots of different
tools and techniques

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that you teach about
in all of your books.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one
of the affirmations

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.050 align:middle line:84%
that I apply to
these types of things

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.610 align:middle line:84%
is, it is safe and comfortable
for me to, whatever.

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Swim.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Leave my daughter alone.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So the three things that
we've talked about here,

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:26.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of law of attraction
and karma and success,

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:29.700 align:middle line:84%
how do you link all of
those things together?

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Basically, it forms
the hologram of our identity.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.740 align:middle line:84%
All these things come in to
form-- like the hologram is

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.860 align:middle line:90%
a three-dimensional light image.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see our
energy and our consciousness

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.480 align:middle line:90%
moving out into the world.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
things come together

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to form the life force energy
of our eternal identity.

00:58:53.650 --> 00:59:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that helps, then, to move
us forward into the destiny.

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.890 align:middle line:84%
If we take charge of our karmic
and our encoded consciousness,

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.050 align:middle line:90%
we can change it.

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:07.360 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, we're just
kind of like riding

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.157 align:middle line:90%
the rails to wherever it goes.

00:59:09.157 --> 00:59:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.
