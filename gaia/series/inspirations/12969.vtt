00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.153 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, welcome.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.656 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.726 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live
here from Boulder, Colorado,

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.995 align:middle line:84%
at the Gaiam Studios
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.796 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.498 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
communicate with us

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.967 align:middle line:84%
and connect with us through
Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.869 align:middle line:84%
We'll be going to you
throughout the show.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.105 align:middle line:10%
And it's great to
have you here with us.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.474 align:middle line:10%
So there have been some
very recent discoveries

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.976 align:middle line:10%
in science and
compelling evidence found

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.746 align:middle line:10%
about our Earth's
history that gives us

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.781 align:middle line:10%
reasons to really
think differently

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.184 align:middle line:10%
about ourselves and about
the origin of our species.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.321 align:middle line:10%
So, joining me today is New
York Time best-selling author,

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.489 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:84%
He is recognized as
a pioneer in bridging

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.192 align:middle line:90%
science and spirituality.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.595 align:middle line:84%
And today, Gregg's
going to bring

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:05.232 align:middle line:84%
his knowledge of being
a computer geologist

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.534 align:middle line:84%
and also the first
technical operations

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.036 align:middle line:90%
manager at Cisco Systems.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to help us
understand this critical time

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.307 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:16.777 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of the book
called Deep Truth: Igniting

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:20.614 align:middle line:84%
the Memory of Our Origin,
History, Destiny, and Fate.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.682 align:middle line:90%
Hello and welcome.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:21.949 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello, Lisa.

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:22.683 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to be here.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.351 align:middle line:84%
And I am so happy to
be with all of you,

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.687 align:middle line:84%
our viewers all over
the world tonight.

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:27.187 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Thank you for
the opportunity to share.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.257 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to talk about.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.358 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a lot, yes.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: My sense
is our time together

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:90%
is going to go by very quickly.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.328 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
going to be great.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.896 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be an
amazing amount of information

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.199 align:middle line:84%
and education for you
so stay with us here.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.401 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about the book Deep Truth.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.636 align:middle line:90%
Now what does the title mean?

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.003 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
the book itself--

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.941 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book in response
to our time in history.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:10%
I think if you're watching
this, it's no secret to you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.479 align:middle line:10%
that this is no ordinary time
in the history of our country,

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.948 align:middle line:10%
in the history of
our civilization,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:10%
in the history of our world.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.818 align:middle line:10%
It's not our imagination.

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.519 align:middle line:10%
The best minds of our
time are telling us

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.089 align:middle line:10%
that we are facing the greatest
number, Lisa, the greatest

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.391 align:middle line:10%
number and the
greatest magnitude

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:10%
of crises ever to face
a single generation all

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.031 align:middle line:10%
funneled into this little window
of time at the end of the 20th

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:12.799 align:middle line:10%
and now the 21st century.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.135 align:middle line:84%
The book, Deep
Truth, the title--

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.004 align:middle line:84%
where this title comes
from, it's actually

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:21.041 align:middle line:84%
a quote from one of the great
physicists of the 20th century,

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle line:90%
Niels Bohr.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.044 align:middle line:84%
He was having a conversation
with Albert Einstein.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:25.478 align:middle line:90%
They were talking about truth--

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.848 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I sure would have
loved to be a fly on that wall.

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:28.882 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.385 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it was the
nature of scientific truth.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.553 align:middle line:84%
And what Niels
Bohr said is this,

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.724 align:middle line:84%
he said it is the hallmark of
any deep truth-- in this case,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:42.696 align:middle line:84%
a scientific truth-- that its
negation is also a deep truth.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:46.833 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that means is that
the scientific foundation

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.769 align:middle line:84%
upon which we base
many of our beliefs

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:84%
about who we are, our
relationship to ourselves,

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:84%
to our bodies, to one another,
and to the world-- it's

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.644 align:middle line:84%
based upon a foundation
of scientific beliefs--

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:01.848 align:middle line:84%
new discoveries are now
overturning those beliefs.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.716 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:04.384 align:middle line:84%
The flip side of
this is there is

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:08.288 align:middle line:84%
a reluctance and, in some
cases, an outright resistance

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:84%
for the mainstream media,
mainstream academia,

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:15.462 align:middle line:84%
classrooms, textbooks to
share the new discoveries.

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:16.963 align:middle line:84%
This would be
important at any time.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.532 align:middle line:84%
But it's especially
critical right now

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:21.635 align:middle line:84%
because we are at this moment of
crisis in our time in history.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely, and
it's to no fault of theirs.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.872 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
such new discoveries.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.341 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea of
doing a show like this

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:31.545 align:middle line:84%
is to get it into
the minds of people.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.346 align:middle line:84%
Because this is going
to shatter beliefs.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.083 align:middle line:84%
This is going to shatter
systems that we were taught

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.852 align:middle line:84%
in school about
history and evolution.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:39.986 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely, Lisa.

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.555 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be very
clear that this is not

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.656 align:middle line:90%
the teacher's fault.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.826 align:middle line:84%
There's a story, there's
a scientific story

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.627 align:middle line:84%
that has developed
and been embraced

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.496 align:middle line:84%
for over a century
and a half about who

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.465 align:middle line:84%
we are and our
relationship to the world.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.101 align:middle line:84%
And it takes time to
change that story.

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.868 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.269 align:middle line:84%
What the experts
are telling us is

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle line:84%
we don't have decades
to change the way

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.574 align:middle line:84%
we think of ourselves
so that we can

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.942 align:middle line:90%
solve the crises of our time.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.112 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think this
program is so important today.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.447 align:middle line:84%
So what I've done
for our viewers,

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.949 align:middle line:84%
I've put together
a few images that

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.451 align:middle line:84%
will kind of highlight
this conversation

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and share some of
the discoveries

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and some of the rare images
from ancient civilizations

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.524 align:middle line:84%
and things as we go
through our conversation.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.159 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK--

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.361 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --if we use these to--

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.229 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --take us
through where we are.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
your screen right now--

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.534 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is, by the way,
a very, very special treat.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.636 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of these
images-- Gregg owns them.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.805 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing them
for the first time here.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:32.439 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Some of them.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.807 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --good stuff.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.008 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: So then, if you're
looking at your screen

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:10%
right now, what
you're seeing, this

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.778 align:middle line:10%
is a special edition of
"Scientific American."

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.615 align:middle line:10%
It was released in
September of 2005.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:44.183 align:middle line:10%
And if you think back, we were
living a very different world

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.253 align:middle line:10%
from 2005 and where
we are right now.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.354 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Not so long ago.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:50.857 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But this was some of
the leading minds of our time.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.727 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, engineers, social
architects, political leaders,

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:56.129 align:middle line:84%
spiritual leaders, religious
leaders, philosophers,

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
they all came together.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.067 align:middle line:84%
And they were asked, what makes
our time in history so unique?

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.803 align:middle line:84%
What's different now about
any other time in history?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.906 align:middle line:84%
And the answers,
Lisa, were so profound

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.508 align:middle line:84%
that "Scientific American"
released a special edition

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to bring the rest
of the world up

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:84%
to speed with what the experts
were telling us was happening.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:16.149 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, we're
at this critical time,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.485 align:middle line:84%
this critical time in
the history of our world

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.454 align:middle line:84%
where the way that we
have lived is changing.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.191 align:middle line:84%
And to address the crises
that are being created,

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.193 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think
differently than we have ever

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.594 align:middle line:90%
thought of ourselves before.

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to change the
thinking very, very quickly.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.398 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why
this is important

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.066 align:middle line:84%
is because, at this
particular time,

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.569 align:middle line:84%
we hear all this information,
mixed information,

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.538 align:middle line:84%
about global warming and then
there's the economic meltdown

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.574 align:middle line:84%
and there's our entire
corporate crisis.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
There's so much going on that's
affecting each individual

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.546 align:middle line:84%
on an individual basis, in their
family's home life, whatever.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, it is.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.316 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they
were telling us about.

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:52.819 align:middle line:84%
They talked about how we
deal with climate change,

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.957 align:middle line:84%
our inability to grow food to
feed the seven plus billion

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.192 align:middle line:84%
people on the planet right
now, the disappearing

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.328 align:middle line:84%
of vital resources
like fresh water

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:04.698 align:middle line:84%
and food, the collapse,
the inevitable collapse,

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.599 align:middle line:90%
of the global economy.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.337 align:middle line:84%
2005, they knew it was coming
because the systems that

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:14.574 align:middle line:84%
were in place at that time
were unsustainable systems.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.009 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we're seeing.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.911 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
world and the things that

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:19.279 align:middle line:84%
are changing, for
many people it looks

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.114 align:middle line:84%
like everything's coming
apart at the seams.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:84%
If we look closely, what we see
is the only things coming apart

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.486 align:middle line:84%
are the unsustainable
ways of living

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.788 align:middle line:84%
based on unsustainable
ways of thinking.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.024 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries,
now, are telling us

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:33.659 align:middle line:84%
where we can shift and
giving us very good reasons

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.561 align:middle line:90%
to make those changes.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, in fact,
this is really no surprise.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.064 align:middle line:84%
And as you have
learned and you're

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.699 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us
about today, that this

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.868 align:middle line:90%
is a repeated cycle in history.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:42.534 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:44.471 align:middle line:84%
And I was trained as
a scientist, Lisa,

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:45.639 align:middle line:90%
and I think science is good.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.207 align:middle line:84%
Science doesn't have
all the answers.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:50.543 align:middle line:84%
But my scientific mind was
asking the question, why now?

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.712 align:middle line:84%
Why would all these changes
be happening right now?

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.214 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
beginning understand

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.283 align:middle line:84%
is that many of the
changes are actually

00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:59.185 align:middle line:84%
triggered by Earth's
location in space.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.154 align:middle line:84%
It's things like the
tilt and the wobble

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:90%
and the angle and the orbit.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.292 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a very dynamic
body in the heavens.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just rotate
to create night and day

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.329 align:middle line:90%
and tilt for the seasons.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.398 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
going on, but some

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.633 align:middle line:84%
of the cycles that
define these things cover

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:17.337 align:middle line:84%
such vast periods of
time, no one in our time

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:19.239 align:middle line:84%
remembers the last
time that it happened.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle line:84%
And this where-- this is where
our ancient and indigenous

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.877 align:middle line:90%
traditions are so valuable.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:26.146 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
carried, perpetuated

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:27.647 align:middle line:90%
the story of these changes.

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.082 align:middle line:84%
So our own science
now is, in fact,

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.584 align:middle line:84%
telling us that
changes are upon us.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
they parallel many

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions of our most
cherished ancient indigenous

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.258 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:39.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which we'd
love to learn about.

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.561 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
some of those-- I

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
think we've all heard of
native traditions that

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.265 align:middle line:90%
talk about changes.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And many of those are
from native cultures

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.768 align:middle line:90%
that are close to the earth.

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.437 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about
when a white buffalo

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.339 align:middle line:84%
is born in the plains
of North America,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.641 align:middle line:84%
or when the crops no longer
grow in their season.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.143 align:middle line:84%
And for a scientist,
that's not very scientific.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.446 align:middle line:84%
But we like the Maya
a lot because the Maya

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.114 align:middle line:90%
thought a lot the way we think.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:04.084 align:middle line:84%
The Maya talked
about cycles of time

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
based in astronomical
events and celestial cycles

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.923 align:middle line:84%
that we can confirm on
our computers today.

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:12.992 align:middle line:84%
So they are talking a
language of mathematics

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:90%
that we understand.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.262 align:middle line:84%
And what the Maya told us-- if
you're looking at your screen

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:19.766 align:middle line:84%
right now, the Maya told
us about cycles of time.

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.102 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
the image on the screen

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:23.336 align:middle line:90%
is the Mayan calendar.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:23.937 align:middle line:90%
And it is not.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.405 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very
clear about that.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:29.042 align:middle line:84%
This is the Aztec calendar
that is based on Mayan ideas.

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:31.077 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
single artifact that

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.912 align:middle line:84%
represents all
the different ways

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:35.181 align:middle line:84%
that the Maya were
able to track time.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.485 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing
on the Aztec calendar--

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:84%
the four boxes that you see
highlighted in your screen

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:84%
represent four cycles
of time in the past

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:48.661 align:middle line:84%
that parallel the cycles
that we're having now.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.498 align:middle line:84%
What they said is
every 5,125 years

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.665 align:middle line:90%
we go through a big change.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.969 align:middle line:90%
It is called a great world age.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:58.705 align:middle line:84%
And that we are nearing the
end of a great world age.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:08:59.939 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of the world.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.107 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of a world age.

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.443 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did they know that?

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:06.312 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: How did they know
without computers, GPS,

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:07.046 align:middle line:90%
and satellite?

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:07.614 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the great mysteries.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:08.915 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And archeological digs.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.116 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We could do a
whole program on that.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:10.417 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:10.683 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And there's
some very good theories

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.687 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk about
as we go through our program.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.123 align:middle line:84%
The fact is they did
understand cycles in their time

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.125 align:middle line:84%
that we're only beginning
to understand in ours.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And they told us in the language
of their time, a language

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that's only now
beginning to make sense.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.831 align:middle line:90%
[CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:27.534 align:middle line:84%
So they told us about
four cycles in the past,

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
5,125 years long.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.274 align:middle line:84%
And they told us that we are
living the fifth and final

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
in a series of five
of these cycles.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.779 align:middle line:84%
We're living this
cycle right now.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.915 align:middle line:84%
And that this cycle would
end in our lifetime.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.084 align:middle line:84%
That this cycle began with
a rare astronomical event,

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:47.454 align:middle line:90%
August 11, 3114 BC.

00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:49.055 align:middle line:90%
This is the biblical era.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:52.225 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it's when so
many of our spiritual traditions

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:84%
were created to help people
deal with the changes--

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.428 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.729 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --in their
lives then, very

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.398 align:middle line:84%
similar to what we're
living right now.

00:09:58.398 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So religion
in those types

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.803 align:middle line:84%
of contexts happened because
of the confusion that

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:04.938 align:middle line:90%
was happening at that time.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.673 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: At least, they
happened at the same time.

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:08.408 align:middle line:84%
What we can say is
in response to what

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:84%
was happening-- so the cycle
began August 11, 3114 BC.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:18.685 align:middle line:84%
They told us that this cycle
would end precisely 1,872,000

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:23.823 align:middle line:84%
days later-- that is
5,125 years later--

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:28.895 align:middle line:84%
with another rare astronomical
event that occurs on the winter

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.598 align:middle line:84%
solstice, December
21 of the year 2012.

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:32.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 2012, yeah.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.701 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So this is where
this date comes from.

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not a date that
just is made up or comes,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.339 align:middle line:84%
you know, we just
pulled out of the air--

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From movies, yeah.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It is linked
directly to astronomical cycles

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle line:90%
that we can confirm today.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.214 align:middle line:84%
And what they told us-- and
this is very, very important--

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.949 align:middle line:84%
they didn't say it's
the end of the world.

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.684 align:middle line:84%
They said that it's
the end of a world age

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.454 align:middle line:84%
and that anything that
was not sustainable,

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.823 align:middle line:84%
that our way of
life would change.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.858 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say that
the world would end.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:00.793 align:middle line:84%
And there's no scientific
evidence, in fact,

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:03.329 align:middle line:84%
to support the theories
that the world is ending

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:84%
and many people are
putting forward.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.398 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about this is this

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.538 align:middle line:84%
is evidence that has existed for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.806 align:middle line:84%
And just because--
it's so interesting

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:17.443 align:middle line:84%
that this time in history
has been predicted.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:20.213 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's been predicted,
prophesized, feared, embraced,

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:90%
depending on your perspective.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle line:84%
But the key is, in
our culture, we've

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.054 align:middle line:84%
been taught to think in
a linear perspective, led

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:30.623 align:middle line:84%
to believe that we live-- that
our civilization is linear.

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.592 align:middle line:84%
It happened once in the
primitive civilization,

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.628 align:middle line:84%
and now here we are at the
pinnacle of the sophistication

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle line:90%
that we have today and--

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.298 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, because
science is relatively young.

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It is
relatively young.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.267 align:middle line:84%
Science is only
about 300 years old.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is young
in this overall-

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.003 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Science is good.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.705 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, I was
trained as a scientist.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.274 align:middle line:84%
But we know that science
doesn't have all the answers.

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Science can only be as useful to
us as we allow it to be honest.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.815 align:middle line:84%
And to keep science
honest, we must

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.484 align:middle line:84%
allow the scientific
story of our lives

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.521 align:middle line:84%
and our world to be updated
with new discoveries

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:03.556 align:middle line:84%
when they are
proven to be facts.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're
running into problems today.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.395 align:middle line:84%
There's a scientific story
that is about 150 years old,

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.198 align:middle line:84%
about us, where we come from,
our relationship to the Earth,

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:15.335 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to our
bodies, our relationship

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:16.836 align:middle line:90%
to civilization.

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:20.473 align:middle line:84%
And that story, as we're going
to see in just a few minutes,

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.875 align:middle line:84%
is based on a number
of false assumptions.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.611 align:middle line:84%
Now that new discoveries
are overturning

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.646 align:middle line:84%
those false assumptions,
it gives us good reasons

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:27.547 align:middle line:90%
to think differently.

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:31.284 align:middle line:84%
But somehow our ancestors knew
that these cycles were coming.

00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:35.021 align:middle line:84%
Our own science now is
beginning to confirm these.

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:38.324 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places--
I wanted our viewers

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:41.294 align:middle line:84%
to see this-- the ice
caps of our planet

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.696 align:middle line:84%
are virtual libraries of
the history of our world.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:44.564 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm, amazing.

00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:46.232 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Every year,
a new layer of ice

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.301 align:middle line:84%
is deposited that has a
record of the climate,

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.803 align:middle line:84%
the dust, the pollen,
little bubbles

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.405 align:middle line:84%
of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:53.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For thousands of years.

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, in
1999, the scientist

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:84%
of the earth got
together and drilled

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.145 align:middle line:84%
through the thickest
part of the ice

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the
record that's there.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.482 align:middle line:90%
Because the ice is melting.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.084 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to preserve as much
as they could before it melts.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.453 align:middle line:84%
And to their amazement--
now, each layer

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.956 align:middle line:84%
represents one year of
the history of the Earth.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.991 align:middle line:84%
And even the scientists,
I think were amazed.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.493 align:middle line:84%
Because when these
cores came up,

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:19.699 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, 450,000 layers of ice.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.002 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 450,000 layers, years.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Each
layer is one year.

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.239 align:middle line:90%
450,000--

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:26.806 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Years.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.207 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --years of the
history of the Earth.

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.142 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, we have--

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:29.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --of evidence.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.511 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --to compare to where
we are right now, to find out,

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:32.278 align:middle line:90%
is Earth broken?

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.112 align:middle line:90%
Have we broken it?

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.081 align:middle line:84%
Are we living an
anomalous cycle?

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:37.583 align:middle line:84%
And the answers to that are
driving many or the discoveries

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.885 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about today.

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:40.953 align:middle line:84%
So if our viewers have
never seen ice cores,

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:42.622 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see what
an ice core looks like.

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:43.856 align:middle line:90%
It's on your screen right now.

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:44.991 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is fascinating.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:45.992 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes, go ahead.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:50.163 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this was
discovered in 1999.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.966 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that it hasn't
hit mass mainstream media.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.202 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at all of the
history that's right there.

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, from
these ice cores,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.205 align:middle line:84%
we can tell a lot about
the history of the Earth.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about temperature,
about ancient sea levels,

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:84%
the strength of the sun
reaching the earth--

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:04.444 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:06.245 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: --the magnetic field
of the Earth, all those things.

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.448 align:middle line:10%
So what I'd like for
our viewers to see,

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:11.084 align:middle line:10%
there's a screen-- an image
on your screen right now.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:12.351 align:middle line:10%
To the left is present day.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.587 align:middle line:10%
To the right is
450,000 years ago.

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.122 align:middle line:10%
All I'd like for
you to see from this

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.491 align:middle line:10%
is that there are obvious
cycles that are happening.

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:20.593 align:middle line:10%
And we can definitely
see these cycles.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:24.697 align:middle line:10%
And the cycles are about
100,000 years a piece.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.233 align:middle line:10%
The graph on top
is one ice core.

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.802 align:middle line:10%
The one in the middle, the
green, is a second ice core.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:10%
You can see they
parallel one another.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.473 align:middle line:10%
The one on the bottom is
the thickness of the ice.

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:34.674 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: We want to come back.

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:35.842 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:36.976 align:middle line:10%
When we come back,
we're going to talk

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.811 align:middle line:10%
about the significance
of all of this,

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.847 align:middle line:10%
what these cycles represent.

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:43.616 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, on the
graph, that there are cycles.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.218 align:middle line:84%
If you know patterns
at all, you see

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:84%
that there are cycles
that are happening.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.756 align:middle line:84%
Gregg is going to take us
through what those cycles mean,

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.658 align:middle line:84%
why this is relevant in
this conversation today,

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.393 align:middle line:90%
and what it means to us--

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:54.527 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:55.561 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in our everyday life.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.029 align:middle line:84%
And then, the best
thing about it

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.998 align:middle line:90%
is what we can do to affect it.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.133 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:01.934 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:02.502 align:middle line:90%

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.539 align:middle line:10%

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.113 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hi, welcome back.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:14.847 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Gaiam
Inspirations" here on Gaiam TV.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.252 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Gregg Braden.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
his book Deep Truth.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.756 align:middle line:10%
And what we've been talking
about before the break,

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.725 align:middle line:10%
the cycles that have been
predicted, that we're

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:27.727 align:middle line:10%
going through right now,
and some of the reasons

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:30.463 align:middle line:10%
why we're experiencing
some of the global crises

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:31.664 align:middle line:10%
we're experiencing right now.

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:32.165 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:32.899 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.534 align:middle line:10%
Well, just before
the break what we saw

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:10%
was that, from the ice
cores in Antarctica--

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.705 align:middle line:10%
and this is a very, very high
level we're looking at these--

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:43.776 align:middle line:10%
but the data shows us that
there are definite cycles

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.779 align:middle line:10%
and that we are precisely
where we would expect

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.515 align:middle line:10%
to be at the time in the
cycle that we're living now.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:10%
That the parameters
that are changing,

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:10%
the amount of sunlight reaching
the Earth, the climate change,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.456 align:middle line:10%
the temporary warming,
the melting of the ice,

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.025 align:middle line:10%
this is precisely
what we would expect

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.459 align:middle line:10%
to see at this
point in the cycle.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.961 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't last forever.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.298 align:middle line:84%
And then, it goes into the
next portion of the cycle.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So what this says
to me is that I'm

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.703 align:middle line:84%
less concerned about the
physical changes in our world

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:11.204 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:16:11.204 --> 00:16:12.438 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors
lived through them.

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:13.239 align:middle line:90%
They wrote to us.

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:15.608 align:middle line:84%
They told us in the
language of their time

00:16:15.608 --> 00:16:18.044 align:middle line:84%
what we would need to do to
work through these cycles.

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.412 align:middle line:84%
Now, our own
science is beginning

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.747 align:middle line:84%
to confirm what our
ancestors told us.

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:24.116 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about our
relationship to cooperation

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:26.252 align:middle line:84%
and competition and the
way deal with problems,

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:28.487 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve problems
in our lives today.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
very, very important.

00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:32.425 align:middle line:84%
Because we are-- this
cycle has been predicted.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:35.061 align:middle line:84%
It is-- We're in the
right time in the cycle

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:37.129 align:middle line:84%
if you know enough about
what we're talking about.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.465 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's why
this is so important.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we can really
do to affect it.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.903 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, it is actually--
rather than viewing the Earth

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:48.374 align:middle line:84%
as being broken, it's actually
a rare, precious, pivotal moment

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:51.344 align:middle line:84%
and opportunity to
change the things

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.446 align:middle line:90%
in the past that no longer work.

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:54.814 align:middle line:90%
It's a reality check, Lisa.

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:55.848 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, we're
seeing that everywhere.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The things
we've done that no longer

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:58.251 align:middle line:90%
work, let's stop doing them.

00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.553 align:middle line:84%
And the things that we've
done that work well, let's

00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:01.254 align:middle line:90%
do a lot of them.

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:02.321 align:middle line:90%
Are there systems broken?

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:02.822 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:04.857 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
beautiful things happening

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.895 align:middle line:84%
in the world and a very,
very beautiful opportunity

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:12.498 align:middle line:84%
to embrace and bring
those new systems forward,

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
healing of our bodies,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to our food,
the way we live our lives.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.671 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And with our families
and our work and everything.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.005 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what did
it all stem from?

00:17:20.138 --> 00:17:22.174 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, when I
wrote the book Deep Truth,

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:24.743 align:middle line:84%
one of the questions
that I wanted

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.811 align:middle line:84%
to answer for
myself is why do we

00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:28.881 align:middle line:84%
think about ourselves
the way we do?

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.616 align:middle line:84%
And how do we
solve these crises?

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:33.085 align:middle line:84%
And what became very
apparent is that the way

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:84%
that we answer a single
question determines

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.722 align:middle line:90%
how we solve our crises.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.925 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
simply this, who are we?

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:39.625 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm, yes.

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:42.595 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Or who am I? --when
we think about ourselves.

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:45.698 align:middle line:84%
That seemingly innocent,
very benign little question

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:47.733 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
filter through which

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.969 align:middle line:84%
we will create all
of the decisions

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.404 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
choices to address

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
every personal or
collective crisis.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.607 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:56.075 align:middle line:84%
And where does that
idea come from?

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.877 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And where are we
going into the future?

00:17:57.877 --> 00:17:58.644 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:17:59.512 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --personally, as well.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:00.379 align:middle line:90%
What are our goals?

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.213 align:middle line:90%
What are our dreams?

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:01.714 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:02.515 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:06.285 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based, however, on
the way we think of ourselves.

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:09.655 align:middle line:84%
And rarely do we have the
opportunity to really, really

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
embrace that and
think about that.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we do think
about that, what we find

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.429 align:middle line:84%
is that much of our
lives and our world today

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.364 align:middle line:84%
is based on scientific
assumptions, some

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:90%
of them 150 years old.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.667 align:middle line:90%
There are many of them.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.135 align:middle line:84%
I've identified
five in the book.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:25.871 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share them with
our viewers right now, quickly.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:26.038 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.039 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And then, zero
in on the one that's

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.674 align:middle line:84%
having, I believe, the
greatest impact today.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.242 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So think
about these as things

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:32.712 align:middle line:84%
that shape our societies,
that shape our belief

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:33.779 align:middle line:90%
systems, really.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.382 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So if you're looking
at your screen right now,

00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:37.683 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing--
when you were in school,

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:40.052 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, when I was in school,
young people in school today,

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:43.055 align:middle line:84%
we're being taught these
assumptions as facts.

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.858 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see
that they are not facts,

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:46.692 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:47.159 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:48.894 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The first
one is that evolution

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.196 align:middle line:90%
explains life in general.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.131 align:middle line:90%
It explains human life.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.167 align:middle line:84%
The second assumption is
that civilization itself,

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.536 align:middle line:84%
it's about 5,000
or 5,500 years old,

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.972 align:middle line:84%
that it's happened one time
and it's essentially linear--

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That that's it, OK.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:02.508 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --from primitive
to sophisticated.

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:04.477 align:middle line:10%
Number three is that
consciousness is somehow

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.712 align:middle line:10%
separate from our
physical world.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:10.182 align:middle line:84%
Number four is related, that the
space between physical things

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:90%
is empty.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.986 align:middle line:10%
And number five is a Darwinian,
another Darwinian assumption,

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.455 align:middle line:10%
that nature is based
on what he called

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:17.623 align:middle line:10%
"survival of the strongest."

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:19.392 align:middle line:10%
It later became
survival of the fittest.

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:21.227 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And that has
become a big buzz word.

00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And his own words.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.631 align:middle line:84%
All of these are taught
in our schools today.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.466 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
absolutely false.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.135 align:middle line:84%
They've been proven
scientifically

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:31.604 align:middle line:84%
in peer reviewed,
technical journals.

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:32.438 align:middle line:90%
These are false.

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:36.275 align:middle line:84%
The evolution explains
life, not human life.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.844 align:middle line:84%
And in longer programs, we can
get into that in more detail.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.545 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.913 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: But what I'd like
to do right now, if you're

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.982 align:middle line:10%
taking notes, write
false above all these.

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:10%
Put a circle and a big
line right through that.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.851 align:middle line:10%
And let's zero in
on the one that's

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.685 align:middle line:10%
having the greatest impact--

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.953 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Kids at home,
tell your teachers, false.

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:48.888 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --on our lives today.

00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:50.589 align:middle line:84%
If you wonder, if
you're saying, well why

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.857 align:middle line:90%
are these things important?

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.126 align:middle line:84%
These are assumptions that
we now know are false.

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:56.162 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to know
what the consequences

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of these false
assumptions are, we

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.832 align:middle line:84%
need look no further
than the world around us,

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.368 align:middle line:84%
how we deal with climate
change and the failing

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:84%
economic system, how we deal
with the food and the water

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.106 align:middle line:84%
shortages and
disease, how we deal

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:09.175 align:middle line:90%
with the crises of our time.

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:12.344 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look at these
false assumptions, the idea

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.814 align:middle line:84%
that nature is based upon
survival of the strongest,

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.849 align:middle line:84%
this I think is so
deeply entrenched, Lisa--

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:17.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.985 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --in ways that either
consciously or unconsciously,

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:90%
you may not even be aware of.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.689 align:middle line:84%
I'd like for our viewers to
know where this came from.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:26.025 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pulling this right
out of Darwin's book.

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:10%
This is from his book On
the Origin of Species,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:10%
published in 1859.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:33.833 align:middle line:84%
What Darwin said, he looked
in the world around him.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.269 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw examples in
nature of certain insects

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.538 align:middle line:84%
or animals and the way
they behaved there,

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.173 align:middle line:84%
he extrapolated
that and said, that

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:44.777 align:middle line:84%
must be the law for all nature
everywhere, including humans.

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.112 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to share his quote.

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:47.179 align:middle line:90%
This is a direct quote.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.081 align:middle line:84%
He begins by telling
us it may not

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:84%
be logical, what
he's about to say.

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:54.687 align:middle line:84%
So this is what he says, "It
may not be a logical deduction,

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:58.724 align:middle line:84%
but to my imagination it is
far more satisfactory to look

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
at instincts, such as" birds
that the other birds out

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.162 align:middle line:84%
of the nest because
they're different--

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:03.863 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So he was hypothesizing.

00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:06.098 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: He was-- or
ants making slaves out

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:06.799 align:middle line:90%
of other ants.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Because they can do that.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.568 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
bigger and stronger.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.437 align:middle line:84%
He said that it
makes sense to him

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:15.941 align:middle line:84%
to see those as small examples
of a general rule, a law that

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.942 align:middle line:90%
applies to all life.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And here's his law.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.548 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The law is multiply,
vary, let the strongest live,

00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:23.949 align:middle line:90%
and the weakest die."

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:84%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:84%
This is such a dangerous
way of thinking.

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:84%
Our corporations
today that are failing

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:32.925 align:middle line:90%
are based upon this concept.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:35.594 align:middle line:84%
Our global economic system
is based upon this concept.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:38.764 align:middle line:84%
The way that we share
the diminishing resources

00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:41.634 align:middle line:84%
on our planet as we go
through the cyclic shifts

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.869 align:middle line:84%
that we've just identified
in the last segment

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:46.438 align:middle line:84%
are based on this
way of thinking.

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.407 align:middle line:84%
Our young people
in school are being

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:51.076 align:middle line:84%
taught that it's more important
to be right and succeed than it

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
is to develop the
excellence of--

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.714 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Their personal
excellence, yes.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:57.183 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:21:57.183 --> 00:21:59.919 align:middle line:84%
This idea, survival
of the strongest,

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.922 align:middle line:84%
if we want to know the
consequences of this thinking,

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:05.691 align:middle line:84%
we need look no further
than the 20th century.

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:08.427 align:middle line:84%
Some of the greatest atrocities
of human against human

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest
human suffering were

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.665 align:middle line:84%
justified in this
way of thinking.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And many of the crises that
we identified earlier--

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.634 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The famine--

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:16.735 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --the
disease, everything.

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They're all the
result of this way of thinking.

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:22.208 align:middle line:84%
Now, the flip side-- and I
want to get to the good news.

00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that new
discoveries are telling us

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.646 align:middle line:84%
that nature is not based upon
survival of the strongest.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:31.283 align:middle line:84%
Over 400 peer-reviewed studies
were conduct in the late '90s,

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.752 align:middle line:84%
in the early 2000s,
asking a single question:

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:37.356 align:middle line:84%
what is the optimum amount of
competition in any environment?

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
The classroom?

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.724 align:middle line:90%
The workplace?

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:90%
The playing field?

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is violent competition.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.561 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a friendly
game of chess.

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:46.031 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And all 400 studies
came back with exactly the same

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:90%
answer--

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.566 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When was this?

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.735 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --the answer
was zero competition.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:52.171 align:middle line:84%
This was in the late
'90s, early 2000s.

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:54.473 align:middle line:84%
Alfie Kohn, in his
book, No Contest:

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:58.077 align:middle line:84%
The Case Against
Competition, really,

00:22:58.077 --> 00:22:59.311 align:middle line:90%
really brought this to light.

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.747 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want to share
a quote. "The ideal amount

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.949 align:middle line:84%
of competition," he said,
"in any environment,

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:06.452 align:middle line:84%
the classroom, the workplace,
the family, the playing field,

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:90%
is none.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:10.656 align:middle line:84%
Competition always, always,
always is destructive."

00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:13.792 align:middle line:10%
That is followed by
another discovery

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:16.428 align:middle line:10%
in the very prestigious
journal "New Scientist."

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.097 align:middle line:10%
I'm speaking quickly
because I want this

00:23:18.097 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:10%
all in before the break.

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:19.965 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, this
is very important.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:22.234 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: "New Scientist,"
this is April, 2008.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:10%
This is a direct quote
from Michael Le Page.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:10%
What he says is, "What
we see in the wild is not

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.408 align:middle line:10%
every animal for itself.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:33.712 align:middle line:10%
Cooperation," he said, "is an
incredibly successful survival

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:34.647 align:middle line:10%
strategy."

00:23:34.647 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
He goes on to say that when
cooperation breaks down,

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:10%
the results can be disastrous.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.955 align:middle line:84%
And just to give our listeners
and our viewers an idea,

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:45.958 align:middle line:84%
if you want to see a beautiful
example of cooperation,

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you need look no further
than the body that

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.763 align:middle line:84%
houses the soul that is
seeing this broadcast.

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:53.832 align:middle line:84%
Because your one body
is actually a community,

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:57.703 align:middle line:84%
as my dear friend and colleague
Dr. Bruce Lipton reminds us,

00:23:57.703 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion cells that must
cooperate and work together

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.008 align:middle line:84%
to give us the
bodies that function

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.843 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be
in this world--

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:05.577 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, and--

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --if that breaks
down, that is disastrous.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.314 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one example.

00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:10.482 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If that breaks down,
that's what disease is.

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:13.852 align:middle line:84%
And the body is constantly
achieving its highest state.

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:15.888 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
repairing, constantly

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:19.358 align:middle line:84%
trying to regain
that optimal state.

00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:20.526 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, it is.

00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:22.761 align:middle line:84%
And this would be important
at any time, Lisa.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:25.664 align:middle line:84%
But now, within the
context of where we are,

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:28.934 align:middle line:84%
we are the generation
living the close

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:33.439 align:middle line:84%
of a 5,125 year long cycle
and the birth of the next

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:36.075 align:middle line:84%
that happens to coincide
with some of the greatest

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:40.179 align:middle line:84%
physical changes on this
planet, wreaking havoc

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.748 align:middle line:90%
upon unsustainable ways of life.

00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:44.049 align:middle line:90%
We've got to think differently.

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:84%
If we attempt to solve those
crises through the old ways

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.388 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that
led to the crises,

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:50.856 align:middle line:84%
we know where that's
going to lead.

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.958 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's happening
with disease and the increase

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:53.425 align:middle line:90%
in disease.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:53.792 align:middle line:90%
It's happening--

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:54.393 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When we think
about our bodies, sure.

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:55.861 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --with the
economic system.

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.363 align:middle line:84%
It's happening
everywhere around us.

00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:58.197 align:middle line:90%
It's happening everywhere.

00:24:58.197 --> 00:25:00.199 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This idea of
survival of the strongest

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:02.434 align:middle line:84%
and that competition,
violent competition, is good,

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:05.371 align:middle line:84%
it's so deeply entrenched
into our psyche,

00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:08.006 align:middle line:84%
consciously and in many
cases unconsciously,

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
and it has been since 1859,
since Darwin introduced this.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:13.045 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's about to take
on a new dimension.

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:90%
Can I go to the next level?

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:14.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's why you're here.

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:15.414 align:middle line:90%
Yes, please.

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:15.848 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: All right.

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.783 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
civilization and, then,

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:20.119 align:middle line:84%
the role of competition
in civilization.

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school,
you were in school,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:27.059 align:middle line:84%
our young people in school
today are being shown a graph,

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:29.428 align:middle line:84%
a shot very similar to what
you're seeing on the screen

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:29.928 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.497 align:middle line:84%
If you look to your
screen, you see

00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:84%
that civilization,
we're being told,

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:37.035 align:middle line:84%
began around 5,000, 5,500
years ago, ancient Sumeria.

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.004 align:middle line:84%
And then, Egypt came
later and the Indus valley

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:40.372 align:middle line:90%
and India and Greece and Rome.

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember
this from school

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.243 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is the history
of the whole world forever.

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:46.712 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem
is new discoveries

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:47.579 align:middle line:90%
have overturned this.

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But they're not being shared in
the media and in the classroom.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.719 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the
opportunity personally

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:55.421 align:middle line:90%
to explore some of these sites.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:56.588 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:58.023 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: These
are peer-reviewed,

00:25:58.023 --> 00:25:59.291 align:middle line:90%
scientifically accepted.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.093 align:middle line:84%
These isn't a
hypothesis or a theory

00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:02.327 align:middle line:90%
about Atlantis or Lemuria.

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:05.264 align:middle line:84%
These are sites that are
scientifically documented

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:06.031 align:middle line:90%
to be much older.

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.433 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
give two examples.

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:08.967 align:middle line:90%
One, I personally have explored.

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:10.602 align:middle line:90%
This is northern Peru.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
This site now is older than
any other advanced civilization

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.141 align:middle line:90%
in all of the Americas.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:19.144 align:middle line:84%
Older than the Maya, than
the Aztec, than the Inca,

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:19.978 align:middle line:90%
than the Olmec.

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:22.981 align:middle line:84%
This is an area that
is called Caral, Peru.

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:27.319 align:middle line:84%
Five pyramids, two massive,
massive central plazas

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.588 align:middle line:84%
like the one you're seeing
on your screen right now--

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.823 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those have
all been discovered?

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:31.523 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.292 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is an
ongoing archaeological site.

00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:33.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --archaeological--

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.194 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's an
active site right now.

00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:84%
I was there the day that
the labs returned the dates

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:42.334 align:middle line:84%
for the dating for this,
the independent labs.

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
this site collapsed

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.438 align:middle line:84%
when we're told that
civilization began.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:49.208 align:middle line:84%
This site is dated between
5,000 and 7,000 years--

00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:50.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it existed--

>>BRADEN: This is just--
this is one example.

00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:57.249 align:middle line:90%
Let's cut to the chase.

00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:00.219 align:middle line:84%
The oldest civilization now
scientifically documented

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:02.788 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the
world right now is

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
a site that's
called Gobekli Tepe.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It's in Turkey.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.592 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
went there for us.

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:07.092 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
an amazing site.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.628 align:middle line:90%
It's an active site.

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.763 align:middle line:84%
Only four of the temples
have been excavated.

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.332 align:middle line:90%
15 to 20 are still underground.

00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can see through
earth-imaging radar,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.702 align:middle line:84%
is how they know
that they're there.

00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:18.871 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's

>>BRADEN: But we haven't
gotten to that part.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.544 align:middle line:90%
You're giving it away.

>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:27:26.345 --> 00:27:27.779 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So this
site right here,

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:31.116 align:middle line:84%
this site was intentionally
buried 8,000 years ago

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.085 align:middle line:84%
for some mysterious
reason, which

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:35.387 align:middle line:84%
means that everything

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:37.089 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:39.758 align:middle line:84%
Look at the glyphs that

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:42.461 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: 8,000 years

00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:44.463 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the
site is being dated

00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
between 11,300 and
11,500 years ago.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.803 align:middle line:84%
Twice as old as what we're
being told that civilization

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.105 align:middle line:90%
has been in the past.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:56.174 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
our graph of history

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and we plug-in
these dates, there's

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.077 align:middle line:90%
a new story that develops.

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.613 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But why isn't
this more talked about?

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.448 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't this discovery--

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:04.816 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You
know, Lisa, I think

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:07.619 align:middle line:84%
it takes time for
new discoveries

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.523 align:middle line:90%
to trickle down into mainstream.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.824 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of money involved.

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:17.462 align:middle line:84%
For 150 years there's a
scientific story of us,

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to
the Earth, and our past

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.032 align:middle line:90%
that's been taught.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.366 align:middle line:90%
It takes time to change that.

00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:42.421 align:middle line:84%
of course that 5,000 year
old civilization doesn't

00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:43.622 align:middle line:90%
make any sense whatsoever.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:45.023 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, if we go
back and plug in the new

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.359 align:middle line:84%
dates into-- and other
dates we haven't even

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:51.196 align:middle line:84%
talked about-- Egypt, the Giza
Plateau, other sites in India

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.732 align:middle line:84%
and places like
that-- what we find

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.168 align:middle line:84%
is that civilization
reaches back much further.

00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:57.703 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets interesting.

00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
On your screen, if you're
seeing right now on your screen,

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:02.774 align:middle line:84%
the blue area marks the
end of the last ice age,

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
about 12,000 years ago.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.712 align:middle line:84%
After that, 4,000
years, there was

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:10.315 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rain, big
storms, climate change.

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:14.519 align:middle line:84%
And when we put in the lines
that delineate the 5,000 year

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:17.089 align:middle line:84%
cycles-- the dark lines you're
seeing on your screen now-- all

00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:18.857 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, Lisa--
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:22.194 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me. --what we find is
the 5,000 years that we've

00:29:22.194 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
been taught are the history
of the world forever

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.431 align:middle line:90%
are only the most recent cycle.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.867 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries are
now telling us about the cycle

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:31.303 align:middle line:84%
before this right at the
end of the last ice age.

00:29:31.303 --> 00:29:32.037 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, I see.

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:32.904 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Here's why
that's important.

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:33.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:35.073 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It means they
lived, in their time,

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.209 align:middle line:84%
through very similar
conditions to what we're

00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:90%
living through now.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:90%
We can learn from our past.

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:41.647 align:middle line:84%
We can learn what
they did to help

00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:42.881 align:middle line:90%
them get through the changes.

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.517 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based in
this idea of cooperation

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:90%
versus competition.

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:47.119 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is the main point.

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.887 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The last piece of
this, it's so fascinating.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:49.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, wow.

00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Archaeologists have
found that large scale war does

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.398 align:middle line:84%
not appear anywhere before
the 5,000 year cycle

00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:00.465 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.235 align:middle line:84%
When we go back into
these older civilizations,

00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:04.236 align:middle line:90%
they're advanced.

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:05.137 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:06.905 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of any weapons.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:09.374 align:middle line:84%
No evidence of any
protection around the cities,

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:12.878 align:middle line:84%
no walls, no moats, no mass
graves, no mutilated bodies.

00:30:12.878 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's possible they
haven't been found yet.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.582 align:middle line:84%
But so many of these sites
have been excavated now, you

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.651 align:middle line:84%
would think you would
see some somewhere.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.086 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists and
anthropologists

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:23.255 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
suspect that war

00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:26.558 align:middle line:84%
is a habit that was developed
in our cycle early on.

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, we can unlearn it

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.494 align:middle line:90%
as we go into the next.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.296 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to do in this hour

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:35.467 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a key in helping
us to move toward implementing

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:37.936 align:middle line:84%
tipping the scales of peace
and balance in our favor.

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.705 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, now
that's fascinating.

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:43.175 align:middle line:84%
Because it explains
that we didn't live

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.977 align:middle line:84%
in this world of war prior
to this, as a society.

00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:48.246 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
one of our Facebook listeners

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:51.116 align:middle line:84%
is saying, he wants to be
at the top of his class.

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:54.553 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to still get his
graduate degree and so forth.

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:58.557 align:middle line:84%
So he's in that place of wanting
to move up, up, up but yet

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.425 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to
be in competition

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.928 align:middle line:84%
and excluding others,
which is a great point.

00:31:02.928 --> 00:31:03.628 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.864 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: OK, so what
he's actually saying,

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.933 align:middle line:90%
it's not about excluding others.

00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:09.568 align:middle line:84%
It's about becoming
all that he can be.

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:10.535 align:middle line:90%
It's about his own excellence.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:10.936 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm.

00:31:10.936 --> 00:31:12.471 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: If we stay
to the positive,

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:14.206 align:middle line:90%
you don't tear down what is.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:18.009 align:middle line:84%
You show the possibilities
of what has been discovered.

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:19.778 align:middle line:84%
And then, once the
facts are clear,

00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:21.847 align:middle line:84%
I think the choices
become obvious.

00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:23.315 align:middle line:84%
Once the facts are
clear-- teachers

00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:24.983 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
world are coming to me

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:27.185 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying, "How can
we teach this in our classrooms

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:27.352 align:middle line:90%
now?"

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.788 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
peer-reviewed science.

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:30.989 align:middle line:90%
So it should be accepted.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:33.725 align:middle line:84%
This is where we go back
to this idea of science

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.927 align:middle line:84%
is only as good as we
allow it to be honest.

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.362 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
science must be

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:40.365 align:middle line:84%
updated with new discoveries
that are, in fact,

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:43.235 align:middle line:84%
peer-reviewed and accepted--
not just any hypothesis,

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:44.836 align:middle line:90%
but peer-reviewed science.

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.338 align:middle line:90%
This is based on facts.

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:48.306 align:middle line:84%
We're just barely
skimming the surface

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:51.109 align:middle line:84%
in this brief time that
we have together here.

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:54.012 align:middle line:84%
But you get the idea,
certainly, of where we're going.

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:57.649 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that war is as
natural as night and day--

00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.383 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:58.383 --> 00:31:59.384 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --that war
is something humans

00:31:59.384 --> 00:31:59.651 align:middle line:90%
have always done.

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:00.986 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's always
existed, yes, right.

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.054 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And what the new
studies now are showing

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:06.358 align:middle line:84%
is that, while it has existed
in this 5,000 year cycle,

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:08.226 align:middle line:84%
that it may not be
our truest nature.

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:10.562 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, in fact, a
habit that has been learned,

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
then it's a habit
that can be unlearned.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.699 align:middle line:84%
I believe that war
will become obsolete

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:15.634 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetimes, Lisa.

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:16.434 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:18.003 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I'm encouraged
by what I'm seeing.

00:32:18.003 --> 00:32:18.136 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:20.038 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think this
is the generation where

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:84%
we turn our backs and
we walk away from war

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.608 align:middle line:90%
as a way to solve our problems.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.377 align:middle line:90%
Because it is obsolete.

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:27.913 align:middle line:84%
It no longer serves the
purpose it has in the past.

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:29.581 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is the
main point here.

00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:30.549 align:middle line:90%
That is the main point.

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:33.985 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about how
to get to that place of cohesion

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.121 align:middle line:84%
and how to get to that
place of coherence.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.989 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
we're going to continue

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:40.425 align:middle line:84%
to take your questions
and comments from Facebook

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:40.926 align:middle line:90%

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.594 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

I'm Lisa Garr.

My guest is Gregg Braden.

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:56.141 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about the deep truths.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.709 align:middle line:84%
In the past segment,
we just talked

00:32:57.709 --> 00:33:01.112 align:middle line:84%
about debunking some of the
false assumptions, specifically

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:03.982 align:middle line:84%
the Darwinian theory of
survival of the strongest.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:07.352 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about the
importance of coherence--

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.019 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:12.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --about the importance
of communication and about some

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.894 align:middle line:84%
of the solutions around
living in a time of war

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:18.063 align:middle line:84%
and, especially, what we're
going through right now.

00:33:18.063 --> 00:33:21.066 align:middle line:84%
Which is reported-- mostly
what we see that's reported on

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:25.503 align:middle line:84%
is about struggle
and about crises

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.172 align:middle line:90%
and the economic meltdown.

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:28.506 align:middle line:90%
And we hear so much about this.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:29.374 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.743 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're offering,
today, a solution to some

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
of that, an opportunity to get
to another place right now.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.683 align:middle line:84%
This is an oasis,
this conversation.

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.584 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, it is.

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.653 align:middle line:90%
And it's not our imagination.

00:33:41.653 --> 00:33:43.755 align:middle line:90%
This is a unique time.

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:47.025 align:middle line:84%
The Harvard biologist EO
Wilson was very clear.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.828 align:middle line:84%
He said we're entering what he
called a bottleneck in time.

00:33:49.828 --> 00:33:51.596 align:middle line:90%
I love the visual from that.

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.431 align:middle line:10%
He said when our
resources and our ability

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:10%
to solve our problems,
we push to the limits--

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.234 align:middle line:10%
and he said that in 2005.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:56.968 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.703 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: I can't
help but think we're

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.439 align:middle line:10%
very near if not at
those limits right now.

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:04.476 align:middle line:10%
So we are being asked to think
very differently than we've

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:05.644 align:middle line:10%
ever thought before.

00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:08.346 align:middle line:10%
And the consequences of
not thinking differently

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:10.748 align:middle line:10%
are the collapse of the
systems in the world around us.

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.217 align:middle line:84%
If we want to know where
false assumptions have led,

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.753 align:middle line:84%
we just look at the
world that we're

00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:16.054 align:middle line:90%
having problems with right now.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.422 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We look
at the news, yes.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:21.525 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So the images that
we're looking at right now

00:34:21.525 --> 00:34:23.561 align:middle line:84%
on our computer, I
think everyone knows

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.664 align:middle line:84%
that we are
influenced by fields,

00:34:25.664 --> 00:34:27.165 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic fields
of the Earth,

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:90%
the solar fields of the Earth.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.635 align:middle line:84%
It's very well
documented in science.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.536 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're
influenced by those fields.

00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:33.737 align:middle line:84%
But if there's any
doubt, I've got

00:34:33.737 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:90%
something I want to show you.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
If you look on your screen right
now, between 1750 and 1920--

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.879 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing on
your screen in the red,

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:44.282 align:middle line:84%
these are showing the
ebb-- this image is showing

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:50.054 align:middle line:84%
the ebb and the flow of solar
cycles on the sun and the way

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:53.224 align:middle line:84%
that they are ebbing and flowing
over this period of time.

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:56.293 align:middle line:84%
The next image you
see, in the blue,

00:34:56.293 --> 00:34:59.264 align:middle line:84%
is the ebb and flow
of human activity

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:03.268 align:middle line:84%
during that time, measured
by cycles of war and peace,

00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:06.871 align:middle line:84%
innovation, new discoveries,
new innovations in science

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.505 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.107 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're very
affected by our environment.

00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:10.542 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So obviously,
there's a correlation.

00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
We could spend a lot of
time looking at this.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.044 align:middle line:84%
But there's obviously
a correlation.

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:14.479 align:middle line:90%
We're influenced by the cycles.

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important now?

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.317 align:middle line:84%
Here's why, because of where
we are in the solar cycles.

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.186 align:middle line:84%
If you look on your
screen right now,

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:24.322 align:middle line:84%
solar cycle 22,
at the very peak,

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:27.258 align:middle line:84%
where we were influenced
by this influx of energy

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:30.195 align:middle line:84%
is where Gulf War
one actually began,

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:31.329 align:middle line:90%
when Iraq invaded Kuwait.

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:32.163 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:33.631 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
when it happened.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:37.502 align:middle line:84%
Solar cycle 23 right in the
middle was September 11, 2001.

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.069 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.238 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So obviously a
lot of chaos coming around.

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:42.173 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it
must happen that way.

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:42.874 align:middle line:90%
But look at this.

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
The very beginning
of solar cycle 24

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:84%
began in January
of this year 2011.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:49.714 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that
cycle kicked in,

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:54.919 align:middle line:84%
what was called the Arab Spring
began with new innovation

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:59.491 align:middle line:84%
happening on a
large scale socially

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.359 align:middle line:84%
in parts of the world
that haven't actually

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.227 align:middle line:90%
had this in the past.

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:04.195 align:middle line:84%
So what it says is that
we are on the leading

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.831 align:middle line:84%
edge of an influx,
powerful influx, of energy.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:07.866 align:middle line:90%
It's not good or bad.

00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:08.233 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not?

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:08.366 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:10.101 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's how
we apply that energy.

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:12.837 align:middle line:84%
We can take the energy of
this new solar cycle and we

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.072 align:middle line:90%
can use that to bump up--

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the past
has not been so great.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.675 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because we
weren't, maybe, aware

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.711 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities and
how it could be used.

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:21.046 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do we know how
long it's going to last?

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:22.847 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They last--
they're 11 years cycles,

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:23.915 align:middle line:90%
is what we're talking about.

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:24.516 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.751 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So we know that
the fields influence us.

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.354 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds of
images tell us that.

00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the new discoveries
are that it's

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.192 align:middle line:90%
a two-way conversation.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.061 align:middle line:90%
We influence the field.

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:37.929 align:middle line:90%
We communicate with the field.

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.398 align:middle line:84%
September 11 helped us to
understand that as well.

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:42.567 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking on your
screen, what you're seeing

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.203 align:middle line:84%
is the data from two
satellites telling us

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:48.173 align:middle line:84%
about the strength of
Earth's magnetic field.

00:36:48.173 --> 00:36:50.875 align:middle line:84%
Each 24 hour day-- you see
the ebb and the flow-- one

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:51.643 align:middle line:90%
satellite's red.

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:53.111 align:middle line:90%
One satellite's blue.

00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:54.012 align:middle line:90%
There's a big spike.

00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:57.248 align:middle line:84%
That spike is
September 11, 2001.

00:36:57.248 --> 00:37:00.218 align:middle line:84%
This is the spike that gave
the scientists the heads up.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
It begins at 9:00 AM
Eastern Standard Time,

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:06.624 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes after the first
plane hit the first tower.

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:10.762 align:middle line:84%
Scientists believe it took
about 15 minutes for the images

00:37:10.762 --> 00:37:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to circulate the world
through the media.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.933 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing on the graph

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:19.971 align:middle line:84%
is the mass outpouring of human
emotion, heart-based emotion

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.606 align:middle line:84%
in response to what
people were seeing.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.774 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was measurable?

00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:23.475 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That was measurable.

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:24.976 align:middle line:84%
This gave scientists
the heads up.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:28.113 align:middle line:84%
This gives new meaning
to the Gaia theory

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:31.916 align:middle line:84%
that we are so deeply connected
to the fields of the Earth.

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.119 align:middle line:84%
This gave scientists the
heads up that, my god,

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:37.388 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to
influence the very field

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:39.424 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth that
connects and sustains

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.359 align:middle line:90%
all life on this planet.

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.295 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it through
heart-based emotion.

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:47.165 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is in
response to a tragedy.

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The question is, can
it happen because we

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.069 align:middle line:90%
choose to create the experience?

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.402 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're going.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.704 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And how is it measured?

00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:54.439 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
this a little bit.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:56.107 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
what scientists now

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.909 align:middle line:84%
know is that this
field-- what's happening

00:37:57.909 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:84%
is every moment of
every day there's

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.713 align:middle line:84%
a conversation between
our heart and our brain.

00:38:01.713 --> 00:38:04.849 align:middle line:84%
The quality of that conversation
is called coherence.

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:09.888 align:middle line:84%
Optimum coherence is measured
as an electrical signal 0.10

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:10.655 align:middle line:90%
Hertz.

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:90%
It's a very low frequency.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:15.226 align:middle line:84%
This is the low frequency
that whales communicate with,

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:15.727 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:17.295 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very low frequency.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.363 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:20.832 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: When we feel
the feeling in our heart

00:38:20.832 --> 00:38:23.034 align:middle line:10%
that creates this
optimum frequency,

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.702 align:middle line:10%
we are in high coherence.

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:27.005 align:middle line:84%
This is where we couple with
the fields of the Earth.

00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
This is where we communicate
with the fields of the Earth--

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At that level.

00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:31.976 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --with the
very organ in our body

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.579 align:middle line:84%
that was designed to
communicate with these fields.

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:37.715 align:middle line:84%
Our brain creates a
relatively weak electrical

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:90%
and magnetic signal.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.384 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:41.553 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But it's our
heart-- we were born, Lisa,

00:38:41.553 --> 00:38:44.522 align:middle line:84%
with the organ in our body
that creates the strongest

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:46.791 align:middle line:84%
electrical and magnetic
field to communicate

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.092 align:middle line:90%
with these fields of the Earth.

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:50.061 align:middle line:84%
This is where healing
begins in our bodies.

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:53.498 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we begin
to tip the scales of balance

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:90%
and peace beyond our bodies.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.668 align:middle line:90%
Let me just share a story.

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:57.168 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It makes sense,
because the heart's

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.069 align:middle line:90%
an electrical system.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.937 align:middle line:90%
But yes, go ahead.

00:38:58.937 --> 00:38:59.404 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, it does.

00:38:59.404 --> 00:39:00.271 align:middle line:90%
--a very quick story.

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:04.609 align:middle line:84%
2001, right after
9/11, I was in France.

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
[CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.712 align:middle line:84%
I was with a large
group, 3,500 people.

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.348 align:middle line:84%
An angry man in the
audience became disruptive.

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.784 align:middle line:84%
The French security people
took him out of the room.

00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:14.552 align:middle line:84%
I asked them to hold
him just for a minute

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:19.123 align:middle line:84%
while we led that group of 3,500
people in an exercise, very

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.793 align:middle line:84%
simple exercise of
coherence for three minutes.

00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:23.561 align:middle line:90%
We brought the man back in.

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when he came in we give
the microphone and said,

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.999 align:middle line:84%
explain, what is
your experience?

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:31.035 align:middle line:84%
He looked at us and he
said, this is so strange.

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.104 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can think
the reason I'm angry.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.639 align:middle line:90%
I cannot feel the anger.

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:37.475 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't access
the emotion of anger

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.677 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
that coherent field.

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.813 align:middle line:84%
What happened in that
room for that man

00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:43.248 align:middle line:90%
is possible for a planet.

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So 3,500 people were
feeling from their heart space

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.285 align:middle line:90%
and it healed this person.

00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:48.453 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't even know why.

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:49.954 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: He didn't know why.

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.556 align:middle line:90%
He knew why he had been angry.

00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.992 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand why
he couldn't feel the anger

00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and access it any longer.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.262 align:middle line:90%
That's possible for a planet.

00:39:57.262 --> 00:39:59.831 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard to
declare war on your neighbor

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:01.299 align:middle line:90%
when you're not feeling that--

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:02.033 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:02.934 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --in your heart.

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.302 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to the
electrical-- I'm sorry,

00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:06.738 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field of the
Earth, there is no them and us.

00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:08.873 align:middle line:84%
Every CEO of every
corporation, every leader

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.808 align:middle line:84%
of every nation,
every blade of grass,

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:90%
every hamster, every goldfish--

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all the same.

00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:16.147 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Every human is all
connected through this field.

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:16.714 align:middle line:90%
We have--

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every family,
yes, every relative.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.853 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We have the ability
to feed and nurture this field

00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:84%
and nourish the field
through our hearts

00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:25.423 align:middle line:90%
if we understand that language.

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.592 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
coherence, which

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:30.428 align:middle line:84%
parallels our most cherished
and ancient spiritual

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.529 align:middle line:90%
and indigenous traditions.

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.167 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is what they knew
5,000 years ago-- 5,125 years

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.103 align:middle line:84%
ago and we're getting back to
in order to bridge that gap.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.371 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Apparently, they did.

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:44.108 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is led, now,
scientists to the hypothesis--

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.678 align:middle line:84%
and specifically scientists of
the Institute of Heart Math who

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:48.846 align:middle line:84%
will be future guests
on this program--

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:49.947 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, Howard Martin.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:52.183 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --pioneers
in researching

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.852 align:middle line:84%
the power of the human heart
to do much more than pump blood

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:56.054 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:40:56.054 --> 00:40:59.023 align:middle line:84%
This led to the hypothesis
that strong, collective emotion

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:02.794 align:middle line:84%
can in fact impact the very
fields that connect all life.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:06.097 align:middle line:84%
That has led to-- the
first of its kind, Lisa,

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:09.667 align:middle line:84%
this is the first of its
kind-- science-based initiative

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:12.236 align:middle line:84%
designed specifically
to make use

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.272 align:middle line:84%
of this connection between
us and the fields that

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:90%
connect the Earth.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.241 align:middle line:90%
Personal coherence is good.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.344 align:middle line:84%
It's good for our bodies,
our immune system,

00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:21.045 align:middle line:90%
anti-aging hormones.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.413 align:middle line:90%
It extends beyond our bodies.

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.049 align:middle line:84%
Global coherence is really
good, the Global Coherence

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.017 align:middle line:90%
Initiative.

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:29.654 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with our
listeners and with our viewers.

00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:31.723 align:middle line:84%
This is the mission
statement for this project.

00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:34.992 align:middle line:10%
The goal of this project is
"to unite millions of people

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:39.797 align:middle line:10%
from varied beliefs and
cultures to shift consciousness

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:42.834 align:middle line:10%
from instability and chaos
to balance and cooperation."

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:10%
That is the purpose of this
first-of-its-kind science-based

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.571 align:middle line:10%
initiative.

00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:48.206 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Not a lot of
companies with that mission.

00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Never has
anything like this

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.541 align:middle line:90%
been attempted before.

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:50.842 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So nice.

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:50.942 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:52.443 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's a
two-phase project.

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:84%
The first phase is
building the sensors

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.648 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about our
relationship to the Earth

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.817 align:middle line:84%
and when we're
impacting these fields.

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.686 align:middle line:84%
On your screen, I would
like you to see this.

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:02.286 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.588 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
a very technical

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:05.289 align:middle line:84%
looking blueprint of
one of the sensors.

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.291 align:middle line:84%
This is what it looks
like on the drawing board.

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.327 align:middle line:84%
But when they're implemented,
look how beautiful

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:10.628 align:middle line:90%
they are in the ground.

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.797 align:middle line:10%
This is the first
sensor installed

00:42:12.797 --> 00:42:13.998 align:middle line:10%
in Boulder Creek, California.

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:16.534 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And that's what measures
the human resonance field?

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:17.935 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: This is one sensor.

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:21.239 align:middle line:10%
Now we have a network of
these sensors on your screen.

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.108 align:middle line:10%
There's one in California, one
in New York, one in the UK,

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:26.677 align:middle line:10%
one in Saudi Arabia, and one in
New Zealand that are presently

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.612 align:middle line:10%
installed.

00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:29.680 align:middle line:10%
When the network
is completed, we

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.382 align:middle line:10%
hope to have this
number that you're now

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.384 align:middle line:10%
seeing on the screen,
an additional-- number

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.052 align:middle line:10%
of additional sensors.

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.921 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to
emphasize is the system

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.823 align:middle line:90%
is up and running right now.

00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:40.825 align:middle line:84%
Every day, it's
sending back data

00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:43.628 align:middle line:84%
that helps us to understand
our relationship to the Earth.

00:42:43.628 --> 00:42:44.829 align:middle line:90%
And what I'd like to do--

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.964 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --if we
have time today,

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.999 align:middle line:84%
let's go through a little
exercise of coherence.

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.668 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to do
that together here?

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:51.702 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely, yeah.

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.971 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: OK, so
what I'd like to do,

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:57.508 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the site
GLcoherence.org--

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and we'll bring
this up in a minute.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.877 align:middle line:90%
You could learn all about--

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.012 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can see
that here for right now.

00:43:01.012 --> 00:43:02.079 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to the
site in later on.

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:02.914 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You can
learn all about that.

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:04.949 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that we
have the opportunity to do--

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:07.018 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's on
your screen right now.

00:43:07.018 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:10%
It's an image, a real-time
image of the Earth.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.256 align:middle line:10%
And everyone-- right
now there are 21 people

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:15.359 align:middle line:10%
in different places on the
Earth who are logged on

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:20.364 align:middle line:10%
to this global coherence site,
feeding, nurturing, nourishing

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.166 align:middle line:10%
this field with coherence.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.835 align:middle line:10%
Each site could be
hundreds of people.

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:25.169 align:middle line:10%
It could be a room with
hundreds of people.

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:10%
Or it could be one person.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.671 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:27.171 align:middle line:10%
Nice.

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:30.808 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: So this creates this
sense of community and family

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.409 align:middle line:10%
that we have.

00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:33.044 align:middle line:10%
It's very, very simple
to learn coherence.

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:34.178 align:middle line:10%
So what I'd like for
you to do-- we've

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.546 align:middle line:10%
done a lot of
left-brained stuff.

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:36.914 align:middle line:10%
Let's just do this right now.

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:40.184 align:middle line:10%
If you would please
uncross your legs.

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:40.751 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:41.185 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do an experience.

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.653 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: I'm going
to do the same.

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:44.856 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:44.856 --> 00:43:47.959 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: The key is to move
our awareness from our mind

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:48.693 align:middle line:10%
into our heart.

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:51.462 align:middle line:10%
And the way our indigenous
ancestors taught us to do this

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.798 align:middle line:10%
is to simply touch
our heart center.

00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:56.067 align:middle line:10%
That sensation automatically
draws our awareness

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:57.768 align:middle line:10%
to the place where we
feel the sensation.

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.136 align:middle line:10%
That's why we
uncrossed our legs.

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.271 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK, so--

00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: So we move our
awareness into our heart.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.746 align:middle line:10%
And as we begin to focus
our awareness in our heart

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:12.116 align:middle line:10%
to the best of our ability,
we feel the feelings

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:17.688 align:middle line:10%
of care, appreciation,
gratitude, compassion.

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:21.893 align:middle line:10%
And breathe as if
those emotions are

00:44:21.893 --> 00:44:24.228 align:middle line:10%
coming from our heart center.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.863 align:middle line:10%
And the music that
you're hearing now

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.299 align:middle line:10%
will help you do
this a little bit.

00:44:28.299 --> 00:44:29.734 align:middle line:10%
Now just take a
couple of seconds,

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:31.602 align:middle line:10%
just a little
experience of coherence.

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:34.171 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Take a break, yes.

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.373 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Take a deep breath.

00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:40.444 align:middle line:10%
To the best of your ability,
feel the feeling of gratitude,

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.446 align:middle line:10%
appreciation, care,
and compassion.

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:46.517 align:middle line:10%
And know that you are
joining your family,

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.818 align:middle line:10%
our brothers and sisters--

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:48.986 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: --around the world--

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:51.822 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: --around the
world in real-time,

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:54.425 align:middle line:10%
this very instant
this is happening.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:57.495 align:middle line:10%
We are nourishing
the very fields

00:44:57.495 --> 00:45:00.331 align:middle line:10%
that connect and
sustain all of us.

00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:05.002 align:middle line:10%
And just like it was hard
for that man in that room

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:08.205 align:middle line:10%
to feel anger when he came
into the field of coherence,

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:11.409 align:middle line:10%
this is the kind of nourishment
in the fields of the Earth that

00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:15.947 align:middle line:10%
will allow us to tip those
scales of peace, cooperation

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:18.282 align:middle line:10%
in our favor as we solve
the economic problems

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:20.284 align:middle line:10%
and the problems
of war and peace.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.386 align:middle line:10%
And you can do this
from your living room.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.522 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You can do this
at any moment of your day.

00:45:24.522 --> 00:45:27.758 align:middle line:10%
You can do this in the
middle of a chaotic day.

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.895 align:middle line:10%
You could do this, maybe,
driving in your car.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:10%
But you'd have to
have your eyes open.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.532 align:middle line:10%
You can do it if you're in
the middle of an argument--

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:34.665 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.534 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: --or you're
in a work environment

00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:37.568 align:middle line:10%
that you don't love.

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:41.072 align:middle line:84%
It could be done to bring
yourself back to coherence,

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:42.573 align:middle line:90%
to a grounded space.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:45.576 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening all over
the world, which is amazing.

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.845 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It is happening
all over the world right now.

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.046 align:middle line:84%
If you'll take one
more deep breath,

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.781 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't opened
your eyes, if you'd

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.984 align:middle line:84%
like to come back with
us-- I know that was fast.

00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:53.718 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to give you just a--

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:54.318 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Experience.

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:55.219 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --sense.

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.588 align:middle line:84%
This is designed to be a
high-level program this evening

00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:01.292 align:middle line:84%
to inform and to share
these new discoveries.

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:04.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, I just want to tell
you, Facebook and Twitter fans,

00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.664 align:middle line:84%
let us know what that
experience was like for you, how

00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:07.965 align:middle line:90%
you could use that in your life.

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:09.433 align:middle line:84%
I want to definitely
hear from you.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.769 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely, well,
as our time is ticking down,

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:14.171 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank Lisa
for the opportunity

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.606 align:middle line:84%
to create this
kind of programming

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.808 align:middle line:84%
and Gaiam for making
this possible.

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:19.777 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful
set, this bandwidth

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.746 align:middle line:84%
that we're broadcasting
on, we couldn't do this

00:46:21.746 --> 00:46:23.648 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't share it with
you if you didn't support Gaiam

00:46:23.648 --> 00:46:25.216 align:middle line:84%
and Gaiam hadn't
created this for us.

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:25.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.785 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So in this way, we
cooperate and work together.

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:28.953 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very, very important.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.821 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And thank
you so much, Gregg,

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.823 align:middle line:84%
because your
information is vast.

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.058 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:37.161 align:middle line:84%
You can see a full 90 minute
presentation with Gregg

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.329 align:middle line:90%

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:40.097 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
thank you, the listener,

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.332 align:middle line:90%
for participating in this.

00:46:41.332 --> 00:46:42.933 align:middle line:84%
Because it's your
energy that makes

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.669 align:middle line:84%
this happen and
your feedback that

00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:46.103 align:middle line:90%
keeps this conversation going.

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:47.405 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so, so much.

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:48.005 align:middle line:90%

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:84%
