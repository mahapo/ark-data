00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:10%
For those of you who have
been studying and living

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:10%
in the consciousness
movement for a long time,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:10%
but you still feel that there's
maybe something missing,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
or another level that
you'd like to reach,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:10%
well then pay close
attention to today's guest.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
This could be the information
that you are waiting for.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
At least, that is what people
say who become familiar

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
with access consciousness.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is Doctor
Dain here the co-creator

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
of Access Consciousness.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's been taught around
the world in over 40 countries

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
for the past 15 years.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's just beginning to
have a huge presence in the US.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.485 align:middle line:84%
So welcome, welcome
to the show, Dr. Dain.

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, Lisa, great
pleasure to be with you.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a great pleasure
to have you with me.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So tell us, what is
access consciousness?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:10%
In short, it's
just a way-- it's

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:10%
a set of tools,
techniques, and information

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:10%
that give you capacities to
change anything in your life

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
you want to change.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
tools out there.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
different things.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:90%
What makes this different?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And what exactly is it?

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd say one of the
biggest things that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
makes it different
is we don't say

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:90%
we have the answer to anything.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:90%
We just have a lot of questions.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.067 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, we
acknowledge that you actually

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:90%
know what's true for you.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're the
only one who does.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
If I can give you
the right question

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
or ask you the right
question, then you

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
can access that
knowing, and thereby

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%
heal and change yourself.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So I come up with
my own answers

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and unlock my own
healing potential.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
come across Access?

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:90%
How did you learn about it?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Oh, boy, 12 years ago-- or I
guess it's 13 years ago now.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:90%
We survived 2012.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So 13 years ago, I
was a chiropractor.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I was starting my
second practice.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had tried every technique
known to man, woman, and child.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And my life still sucked.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And, basically, I just got
tired of waking up unhappy

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like there was no
way I was ever going to create

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:90%
the life that I desired.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, universe,
you've got six months.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.994 align:middle line:84%
Either my life changes
or I'm killing myself.

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care which it is.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And I meant it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.876 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It got
that bad for you.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:90%
It was that bad.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember driving
to work looking left

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and looking right,
thinking, why am I

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the only unhappy person
here on this planet?

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%
It was that bad.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so literally a
week later, I saw

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:90%
an ad for Access Consciousness.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Well-- and the ad
said, all of life

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.591 align:middle line:84%
comes to me with ease,
and joy, and glory.

00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that
made me happy, right?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.588 align:middle line:84%
No, I wanted to kill the person
that put the ad in the paper.

00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I was like, my life is
not ease, joy, and glory.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:90%
It's pain, suffering, and gory.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And so because I was
in such resistance,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I called to have a
session, because if you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
love it or hate it there's
something there for you.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I had one session.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And it literally in
an hour and 15 minutes

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
changed the entire energy
of what I knew was possible.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I had a sense of space again.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk a little
bit about where you came from,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
because you obviously
were sitting

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.351 align:middle line:84%
at that light angry at
the world for a reason.

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about where you were raised

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and your past.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh, boy, well, yeah
it's-- I was actually--

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in the ghetto.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
kid, I was literally

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.121 align:middle line:84%
the only white kid in the
ghetto for eight square miles.

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: In LA?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was
actually in Carson.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.084 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because Carson is going

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:90%
through a Renaissance now.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.983 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, couldn't you have
gone through that Renaissance

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago, you know, when
I needed it, or 35 years ago?

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was growing up there,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I experienced every kind of
abuse imaginable-- you know,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
sexual abuse, emotional
abuse, physical abuse,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:90%
fearing for my life.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
as I look back on it,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that
it wasn't until I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
was about eight years
old that I realized

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I was a different color
than all of my friends.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%
We were just friends.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
At eight years old was the first
time I'd actually got beaten

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:90%
up for being a different color.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And I went home to my
mom, because the person

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
came up to me hit
me and said, what

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
are you doing here, whitey?

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And I went home and
I'm like bleeding.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, mom,
what's a whitey?

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've had this
experience in life

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing sort of
the most horrendous abuse

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
that you can experience.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: And judgment.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And all the judgments,
and all the wrongness

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
that I think a lot of us carry.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was weighing
so heavily on me.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tried so many
things to change it.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't work.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They worked for
about three days.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You know how you'll do
a seminar or something,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and your feeling like,
oh, maybe this is it?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And then for me by Wednesday, I
was back in the doldrums again.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
What I required was
the tools to change it,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and looking from a different
place, which Access

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:90%
actually created.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, based on your past
and based on the fact

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that you went through so
many different tragedies,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.451 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I doubt it ended
at eight years old.

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you get--
DAIN HEER: So true, no.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It kept going.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it kept going
in a number of ways.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was this thing of
just knowing that there

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
should be something greater.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.257 align:middle line:84%
I always had in
here, I knew there

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:90%
should be something greater.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I should
be able to find it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the next
seminar would give it to me,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and the next seminar
would give it to me.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The difference that
occurred for me with Access

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
was I got the sense
of space of what

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
it was like to be alive again.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And I actually didn't lose it.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
From the first
session, it's like I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
was in this
contracted place where

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I was really ready to die.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And I got some space.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
had that where you're

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
going through a tragedy
or a trauma, and something

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
gives you some breathing
room, it's like, oh.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Right, because when you
hit that level of tragedy,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're young
as you were, and you were

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.965 align:middle line:84%
imprintable at that
time, and you had-- you

00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
tend to re-create
that over, and over,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.919 align:middle line:84%
and over again in your life.
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It goes on 16
years old, 20 years

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
old, 26 years old,
until you really,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
really break the pattern.
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Most people never
break the pattern even

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
though they've tried and tried.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And I've been in the same space.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:90%
And tried.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You need something
outside yourself

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to break the pattern
and crack your awareness open.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, something outside
yourself and something that

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
actually looks from
a different place.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite things
about Access Consciousness

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is it looks from a totally
different place than most

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:90%
of what's available currently.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it has
tools that can unlock things

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that, for me at least,
I wasn't able to unlock

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:90%
in any other way.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of great
stuff out there, as you know.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
If I'm talking to anybody
who knows, you know.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah,
I've interviewed

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.745 align:middle line:90%
most of them, right, right.

00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, absolutely,
and a lot of people

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:90%
doing great stuff in the world.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:10%
This is-- it's different
on the one hand.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, anything
that's true-- you know,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:10%
there's an element of truth in
everything that's out there.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:10%
And one of the tools
of Access Consciousness

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:10%
is what's true makes
you feel lighter.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%
A lie makes you feel heavier.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we do in the
creation of Access

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is we actually endeavor
to only do that

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%
which makes us feel lighter.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in the tools
if it doesn't create more

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
lightness, we don't
use it because that's

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
getting us into stuff that's
not actually true for us.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:90%
So the tools are fairly simple.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Fairly simple, yes.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be in order to
not add a bunch of heaviness

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:90%
on to it.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.861 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to ask anyone
listening right now to say,

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
this is it.
This is the end all.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I want you to teach us, if you
can, some of those tools, some

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of the ways that people can
experience this-- in the hour

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have together, ways
that people can understand.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
What types of questions can
we start to ask ourselves?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, one great
question-- and you

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
want to ask this when
something bad happens

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
or when something good
happens-- how does

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.167 align:middle line:90%
it get any better than this?

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: What do you mean?

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
is what most people

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
do is when something, quote
unquote, bad happens, they go,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:90%
oh no.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
left with a problem

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because your point of
view creates a reality.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So whatever point
of view you take

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.107 align:middle line:84%
about what occurs that's the
reality that gets created.

00:07:23.107 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Your point of view
creates your reality.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't create
your point of view.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you-- for
example, there was a guy

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:90%
when Hurricane Andrew occurred.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was standing there.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He was being
interviewed on the news.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was like-- and the guy
said, hey, how are you doing?

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And he went, oh my
gosh, moved down here,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
sunk all my savings into that.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was just a concrete
slab where his house had been.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I sunk all my savings into
that house thinking it

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
was going to be there forever.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Now it's gone.
But I'm doing OK.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I found a pair of
underwear so I'm not naked.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
His point of view
created-- that's going

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
to create a lightness and
a different possibility.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.964 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of this is
about is the ability

00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to change your point of view.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.431 align:middle line:84%
So it's the meaning
that we give things.

00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yeah.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.431 align:middle line:84%
It's our perception
of these things.

00:07:58.431 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.671 align:middle line:84%
And that's what locks us
into that particular feeling?

00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.305 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes.
-And that gets into ourselves?

00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It gets into ourselves.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It gets into the creation
of our entire life.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It gets into the energy that
we carry with us and around us.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is from
the time we were little,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
we perceived what everybody
else was doing, and went,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is how I'm supposed
to be, rather than how would

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
I like to be?

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
How would I like to
be in the situation?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
let's say you grew up

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
with some abusive
people, well, you

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
tend to try to mimic
that because you think

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:90%
that's the way reality is.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Unconciously, yes.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about, how does
it get any better than this?

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
If you ask it in
a bad situation,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
it allows a situation
to get better.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
If you ask it in
a good situation,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
it allows a situation
to get even better.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:90%
That's one.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Another really cool piece
of information that's

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
really helpful is that
98% of your thoughts,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
your feelings, and your emotions
actually don't belong to you.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.991 align:middle line:84%
You're like a big
psychic radio receiver.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like have you
ever known what your mate was

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
thinking before you
even talked to them

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
when you walk in the door?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.926 align:middle line:84%
Or do you ever call
them because you

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
know they need you to
call them except they

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
haven't talked to you?
LISA GARR: Right.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because
you're able to pick up

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:90%
on those energies.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But literally 98%
of your thoughts,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
your feelings, and your
emotions don't belong to you.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
If you were just to go,
who does this belong to?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
To the heaviness, the
judgment, the thoughts,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
the feelings, and the emotions,
if it lightens up at all,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
it's not yours.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask, who does
this belong to every judgment,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
every thought, every
feeling, and every emotion

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
for three days, at
the end of three days

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
you'd walk around like you're
a walking, talking meditation.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.701 align:middle line:84%
So you would assign these
different feelings of heaviness

00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:90%
to other people?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't
necessarily be ours?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, which is interesting
because a lot of times if we

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
feel something we assume
it's ours because nobody

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:90%
ever told us it isn't.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.081 align:middle line:84%
Well, for very
empathetic people.

00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.101 align:middle line:84%
And for people that tend
to be very highly sensitive.

00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.341 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I do tend to
take on the world.

00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing is when you do

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that you're burdening yourself.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.451 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:09:55.451 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And you also want to
help heal the world.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to make it a
better place, of course.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So you think, wow, if
I can take on more pain

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and suffering because
I know I can handle it,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
maybe the world will
become a better place.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, when you let
go of the pain and suffering,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
then you become the
inspiration to the people

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for joy, and who
are looking for possibilities,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and who see no place
else to find it.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want you guys
to take a look at this

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:90%
and determine this for your own.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this video
of Dr. Dain here in action.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I created this class for
the seekers of the world,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
the people in this
world that know

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%
there is something different.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But don't just know
it's different,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
but that know that they should
be able to have it, that know

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing standing
between them and something

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
different is actually the
inspiration and the tools

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of aspects to it.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of stuff that
goes on in the class that's

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
designed to give you not only
the tools to change your life

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
but the inspiration to know it's
possible because you actually

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:90%
see other people change.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, the reason
they're so darn unhappy

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is because they're
trying to live lives that

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.271 align:middle line:90%
have so little to do with them.

00:10:58.271 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
live the life that

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.521 align:middle line:90%
would make their parents happy.

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
live the life that

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:90%
would make their mate happy.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
live their life

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that would make their
dogs and cats happy

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than what
would make them happy.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
When you get to be you,
you get to actually

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:90%
have a life that involves you.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I give
you in this class

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually the tools, because
what it requires is tools.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the things
that we're missing so much,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
is the actual tools.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the trenches and
you just want to kill people--

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
can I say that?-- or when you're
in the trenches and you just

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
want to cry, or you don't know
what to do with your kids,

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like these are the tools
to actually change those

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
situations that we have in
everyday life so that more

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
of our lives can be the space
that we'd like it to be,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.354 align:middle line:84%
the space that we have when
we're playing with kids,

00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the space we have that
we're playing with animals,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
the space that we have
when we're out in nature.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's like to be you.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what it should be
like to be you in every one

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:90%
of the situations in your life.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Imagine living in a world
with complete allowance,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
with gentleness and
caring, and no judgement.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what we got
a taste of here.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
want people to do

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is I'd like them to look
from the perspective of,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
truly, if I could have anything,
if I could have anything

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:90%
in the world, what would it be?

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You know how we preserve
pickles in a pickle jar?

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
When I really got that we
preserve our life like that,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and we wait for some
day when I'll be rich,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
or when I have xyz,
whatever, fill in the blanks,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that I'm really
going to live, wow, I

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
really broke the pickle
jar like, it's outta here.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
We are going to do a
section on relationships.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a
section on bodies.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a section on money.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a
section on future,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and how to actually create your
future from a totally different

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
place than anybody
else on this planet

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:90%
knows or is talking about.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
That, I got to say, is one of my
favorites, because a lot of us

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
spend a lot of time trying
to handle our problems.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I get that, because I
was there 12 years ago too.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.754 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:13:01.754 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Before I came to Access,
that's what I was trying to do,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
was handle all my problems.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But once you start
to create your future

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and you start to head in
that direction of the space

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that future actually
is, the problems

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that are back here
holding you back

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
cease to be able to
hold on to you anymore

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:90%
because you're moving too fast.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And you're too much space.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The other tool that I use-- and
I don't know if you could even

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
call it a tool it's more
of a universe of its own--

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
is something called the
energetic synthesis of being.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy that I stepped
into being several years ago

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
when I first came to
Access Consciousness.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen is I'd
lay a person down on a table.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start working
on their body.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
their body would twitch.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Or it would move.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Or it would flow.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And they would get up and
say, wow, I feel so different.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just that
they felt different.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to
them months later.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
that changed everything

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:90%
that I knew was possible.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I use this energy.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:84%
During the being you class,
I've got a table up there.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be working on
people most of the class.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's the interesting part
is while I'm working on them

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
you can actually get the change
in your body and your life.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like using this person
to facilitate the entire room

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and create change
in the entire room.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You really yet you-- like, not
the preserved version of you,

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%
but the genie out of the
bottle version of you.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
If you're still seeking,
still hoping, still dreaming,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:84%
consider this my
invitation to you

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to actually creating it
in your life as a reality.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I just attended the being
you changing the world course.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm totally new to
Access Consciousness,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what to expect.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is absolutely
the best thing

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.174 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done for myself.

00:14:46.174 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting emotional.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's just been an
amazing experience.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone
should have the opportunity

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to choose this
type of possibility

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
for themselves and their lives.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, thank you,
thank you so, so much.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like it's like a
fixed you now, now you've got

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's a conclusion.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's a complete expansion.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps expanding further,
and further, and further.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Like in the next 10 seconds, I
don't know who I'm going to be.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.578 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really excited about it.

00:15:18.578 --> 00:15:20.514 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:20.514 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So the people that we saw
in the video, when they come

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to you in the beginning,
what do they usually

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.074 align:middle line:90%
say when they're coming to you?

00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, what's interesting
is most of the people

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:10%
that come to Access are
the seekers of the world.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:10%
What most of them
say, even though they

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.990 align:middle line:10%
may want to handle their
money, or their relationships,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:10%
or their body--
you know, the stuff

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.100 align:middle line:10%
that everybody wants to
handle-- they go, you know what?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking my whole
life because I know there's

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:90%
something greater than this.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: I've tried this.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
I've tried that.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I've been to the mountain.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, exactly, I've
been to the mountain.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I've seen Mohamed.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:90%
He didn't help either.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Can you hook a brother up is
kind of their point of view.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And what they find
is this awareness

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:90%
that they're not wrong.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%
They never have been wrong.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
They've been different
their whole lives

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and nobody was able to
acknowledge that different.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.187 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions
I like to ask people

00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
is, what if
everything you thought

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:84%
was wrong about you is a
greatness that you just haven't

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:90%
yet been able to acknowledge?

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Like give me an example.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, there was
a little girl who had OCD.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was washing
her hands all the time.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
within-- my business partner

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Gary Douglas the
founder of Access

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
actually worked with
her for 45 minutes.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And he got her over 80%
of her OCD symptoms.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.257 align:middle line:84%
Well, what he did was he
got her to acknowledge--

00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
remember this who does
this belong to thing

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
we just talked about?

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:84%
He got her to acknowledge
that she was picking up

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts, feelings, and
emotions that she was having,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
or that she thought
she was having.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And she was picking up things
in other people's heads.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And so she was
washing her hands all

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.434 align:middle line:84%
the time to try
to get rid of all

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that stuff that was going on.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
You pick up things
when you're a child.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Most things are
behavior related.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you expand on those.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And you give meaning
to them so they

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
become habits,
patterns, diseases,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:84%
illnesses, all sorts of things.
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So, all right, so then
someone comes to you and says,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
I have a challenge
with pain in my body.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things is
I found when I was using this

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
in my chiropractor practice that
somewhere between 50% and 100%

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
of the pain in people's bodies
actually was not theirs.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And I know that sounds weird.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.074 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if you're
out there listening,

00:17:29.074 --> 00:17:30.839 align:middle line:84%
and you're going, wait a minute.
That's crazy.

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I thought so too.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I had a guy come to me.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd been working on him for
three months as a chiropractor.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
He was in an 8 out of 10 scale
of pain every time he came in.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it would go down
to a three or four

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:90%
until the next time he came in.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
at an eight again.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I got this tool of, who
does this belong to?

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
else to do with him.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, go
to somebody else.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, doc,
you're the only one who's

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:90%
been helping me this much.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And I went, OK.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And as he went to lie down--
and it took him five minutes

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to relax his body enough
to lie down-- I said,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I just went and took
this seminar where I

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:90%
got this piece of information.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a question.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Who does that back
pain belong to?

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And he pushed himself up, and
looks at me, and says my wife.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, within
that moment 80% of his pain

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what was going on.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I just used this tool.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember you saying
to me-- I called

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
you when my husband was sick.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And your said, ask him the
question, what is he sick of?

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's another
great question.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge question.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody is sick,
you literally ask them,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
what are you sick of?

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And they'll tell you.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
He told me.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:90%
He was sick of stress.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Right, yeah.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
we know what we're sick of.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing is
you know something.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I
love about access

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:90%
is that you know something.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:90%
You know your own answers.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And you also know
something else.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
You have this secret that
you've been holding on to.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.407 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually
give it up it

00:18:52.407 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
creates a contribution
of the world that

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
changes the face of Access,
but also changes your life

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
and changes the world.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when ask this,
what are you sick of?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And then ask them, OK, are
you willing to let this go?

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's the follow
up question I didn't--

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: That's the
important one, yeah.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
I missed that piece.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, darn it, I missed
the important part.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
-So what did you say?

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing
to let go of this?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, are you willing
to let this go?

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Or are you willing to destroy
it-- destroy that limitation

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and uncreate it?

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
creating and destroying.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:90%
You talk a lot about this.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of your information
from what I've learned

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is about truth.
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So how do we create and
destroy to get ourselves

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:90%
back to that place of truth?

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you do is you
take-- Im' trying to think

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%
of a real easy example.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So you could ask yourself--
OK, so let's say you're

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:90%
having a relationship problem.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You can go, OK, so
how many judgments

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
do I have of this person I'm
in a relationship with that

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:90%
are killing my relationship?

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And am I willing now to
destroy, and uncreate

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:90%
them, and let them go?

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.027 align:middle line:84%
And if you are, well,
we have this magic wand

00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
called a clearing
statement, which

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is sort of beyond the scope
of today's discussion.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But you just asked to
destroy and uncreate it.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And the universe goes,
oh, cool, no problem.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And you're starting fresh.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
If you were to wake
up every morning

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and destroy and uncreate
the relationship you have,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.057 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean
you get divorced.

00:20:09.057 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
What it means is you're
destroying and uncreating

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
the judgments from the past,
starting and creating anew

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:90%
starting today.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that brings up a
good point, because the clearing

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
statements that you talk
about throughout Access

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness-- and I've had
a little bit of experience

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
with this-- have a
frequency, have an energy

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to them that really
break up current states

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
of reality and energy.
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Do those come from
another dimension?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where do you--
does it come from what?

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, I'd say, yes.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
I'd say, if we went even

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
beyond the
dimensional construct,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and we dissolved the
walls between dimensions,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.877 align:middle line:84%
and got that we are
infinite beings--

00:20:48.877 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
because wouldn't an
infinite being have access

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.694 align:middle line:90%
to all dimensions right now?

00:20:52.694 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: One would hope.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but notice that energy?

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Notice how when I say
that there's a lightness

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and an expansiveness to it?
LISA GARR: Space.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Space, and that is literally
how we can live and be here--

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and not from some weird,
I've got to go live in a cave

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to do this, or I've got to
meditate only and not live

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%
my life, or anything like that.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, how can
you be that right now?

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
How can you be that
with your family?

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:90%
How can you be it at work?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
How can you be it while
walking down the street?

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
willing to, would you

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
be an inspiration
for other people

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
to know that they can be it to?

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.891 align:middle line:84%
You talk also a lot about
inclusion versus competition.

00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important point.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
That's something that's stayed
with me for a while now,

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.405 align:middle line:84%
is what you're
talking about here

00:21:36.405 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes I
would think, well, I

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
have to go on a retreat,
or be on a vacation,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.381 align:middle line:84%
or something, in order to
experience the full relaxation

00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that I need to.
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And you say that
you can actually

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
have that relaxation here and
now and not make it separate?

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
This applies to many different
areas, but explain that.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's who we
actually are as beings.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, when
little kids come in.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't go, oh,
no, life sucks.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:90%
We learn that.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:90%
We learn that life sucks.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And we can also unlearn it.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you could imagine that
little kids have something

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.734 align:middle line:90%
that we love about them.

00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the reason
we love being around them.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the reason we feel
lighter when we're around them,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because what they don't
do is they don't judge.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is one of the
biggest killers there is.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And we've bought that we have
to do it in order to create,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.554 align:middle line:84%
in order to do what's right, in
order not to do what's wrong.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
No, it's actually
when you come out

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of judgement that you create.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't worry about
right and wrong.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You just choose what's going
to contribute more to you

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and the people around you.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And you come out of the
heaviness you often pile

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
on yourself for
thinking that you're

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:90%
somehow wrong in your life.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
question you can ask.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, what judgment
do I have of me

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that if I didn't have it would
allow me to be totally free?

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
What judgment do I have of
me that if I didn't have it

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.495 align:middle line:84%
would allow me to
be totally free?

00:22:55.495 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yeah.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:90%
There's about 90.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.601 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly, and
there's layer, after layer,

00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
after layer.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you use that, if you
ask that question, then you go,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll let that go.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll destroy and uncreate it.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And then just add this
to it, pod and pok.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Pok is the point of
creation of the thoughts,

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
feelings, and emotions where
you lock that thing in place.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you could-- and pod
is the point of destruction.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So you create a limitation
or you destroy your awareness

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that there doesn't have
to be a limitation there

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:90%
in order to hold it in place.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, that can sound
kind of weird.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
go, what judgment

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
do I have of me that if
I didn't have it would

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:90%
allow me to be totally free?

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Will I destroy it and
uncreate it, pod and pok it?

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, what you have
is with the questions-- see,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
a question always opens up
other doorways of possibility.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
What most people do is
they come to a conclusion.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And their conclusion
is all they can see.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.211 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have these walls
to the right and the left.

00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:50.143 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see over them.

00:23:50.143 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
You can't see around him.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have to head
in that direction.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask a question,
it's like doors open

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
to the right and to the left.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have light, and space,
and possibilities behind them.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Those walls got there
because of the decisions

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:90%
that we made in the first place.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And they stay there.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.381 align:middle line:84%
So they can be
unlocked just as easily.

00:24:05.381 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes.
-Just as easily.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But it just seems to me that
just asking a simple question

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to unlock
the walls that I've

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:90%
built up over 20, 30 years.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.397 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Why not?

00:24:16.397 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Because I
made that decision.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Good point.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
interesting thing

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
when people come to Access.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They start sort of
timidly going, OK,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:90%
well let me try to change this.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:90%
And then it actually changes.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel
it in their life.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And that thing is never
a problem for them again.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
more courageous.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, OK, I asked
for this and it changed.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
ask for this now.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:10%
And then you start to
realize that change

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:10%
is actually possible.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:10%
And then life starts
getting excited.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
-And then change becomes easy?
-Yes.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, oh there are so many
more levels and layers to this.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take more time and
talk to Dain a little bit more

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:90%
about the bars.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.737 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to watch
some more video that talks

00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
about this clearing statement,
and some of the clearing

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.757 align:middle line:90%
statements as well.

00:24:55.757 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take a quick break.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back with
Dr. Dain here talking

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:90%
about Access Consciousness.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER): What if
there was an online channel

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
where you could find
thousands of videos devoted

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to really changing your world?

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:84%
What if this channel
offered programming that

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
cared about the things
that mattered most

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to you-- your well-being,
your community, and the world

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:90%
beyond?

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:10%
Most people really are
thinking the same way every day,

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:10%
acting the same way, and
feeling the same way,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:10%
but really hoping
something will show

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:10%
up differently in their life.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.157 align:middle line:10%
And it never does.

00:25:27.157 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:10%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER):
And what if it was also

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to yoga,
fitness, and alternative

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:10%
approaches to health?

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:10%
You don't focus on
what holds you back.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:10%
You focus on what's
already their.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:10%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER):
History and spirituality.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:10%
Ego is the belief that
you are separated from God,

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:10%
which is the most
terrifying thought

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.784 align:middle line:10%
that could ever happen to us.

00:25:44.784 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER): What if
it offered solutions to many

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of the problems we face today?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that there
is something I don't fully

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:10%
understand about life,
the understanding of which

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:10%
would change everything?

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER): What if it
went that extra mile to help

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
you find passion and purpose?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing what you're
supposed to do, doors open.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER): What if this
channel didn't have any ads,

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and instead used its
valuable air time to engage?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE: You will accomplish
so much more if you're happy.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER):
Entertain and enlighten?

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:10%
We are spiritual
beings immersed

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.287 align:middle line:10%
in the human experience.

00:26:17.287 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:10%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER): With
many of the top thinkers

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:10%
and visionaries from
around the world?

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
MALE: We started
this film by asking

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with the world.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up discovering
what's right with it.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE (VOICEOVER):
Well, guess what?

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Inspirational films, original
interviews, engaging series,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:10%
welcome to Gaiam TV--
thousands of streaming videos

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:10%
to fuel your life's journey.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.738 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:45.738 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And joining me is Dr. Dain
Heer from Access Consciousness.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:10%
And we've been talking
about the different tools,

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:10%
and techniques, and
questions, basically,

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:10%
that this level of teaching
offers us, and expands for us,

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:10%
and opens for us.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And most of what
I've been feeling

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
as I've been speaking with
you has been a level of space.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a rainbow has
opened up around me of space.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right, right.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's light.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's enjoyable.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And it often leads to a lot
of giggling and laughter.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: It does.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.293 align:middle line:84%
It leads to giggling
and laughter.

00:27:34.293 --> 00:27:36.101 align:middle line:84%
And people go, you can't
be doing serious work

00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:90%
if you're giggling.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, actually
it's very serious

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
right until we giggle and
then right afterwards too.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's like laughter
creates more change than tears.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Why do we insist,
especially in people

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
who are going for a, quote
unquote, enlightenment, why

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:90%
do we insist on being so heavy?

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Look
that the Dalai Lama.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:90%
He just laughs most of the time.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I know, exactly,
it's got light right

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the word.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:90%
How can-- so--

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Enlightenment, thank you.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so the clearing statement
we were talking a little bit

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:90%
about before the break.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the energy that it has?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And when do you say it?

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say it?

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, what you would
do is you would just

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:10%
think of any limitation
that you want to undo,

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:10%
or any point of
view, any heaviness.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, you could
wake up in the morning

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:10%
and you could say to
yourself, hm, everything

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't allow today to be
the best day so far, I'm now

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:10%
going to destroy
and uncreate it,

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:10%
which is the beauty
of this, is where

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:10%
you put your power to choose
into motion on your behalf.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And then in that destroying and
uncreating, what you're saying

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
is universe, you know what?

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know it would be
that's keeping me from this.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to let it go now.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you go pod and pok it.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do the long form of
the clearing statement, which

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
is right and wrong, good and
bad, pod and pok, all nine,

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
shorts, boys, and beyond, which
is a big mouthful for people.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes their eyes
glaze over when you say it.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But you can just do that short
form pod and pud and pok.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:84%
When I hear you say that to
me, it's when a truth comes in.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's when you are
saying hello to the fact

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that truth happened.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And you expand the
moment of the truth.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Beautifully put.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:90%
When you say that statement.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like-- it
is, it like a magic wand

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:90%
and a statement, that's great.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
you're saying is,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
yes, you've said truth,
create and destroy

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
anything that doesn't allow
you to have the fullness.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about money.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.247 align:middle line:90%
So I saw that--

00:29:27.247 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: A very
popular subject.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, exactly and I saw
you had a whole class

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:84%
on clearing money.
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So you bring these clearing
statements in when-- what do

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
most people have around money?

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:90%
What are the limitations?

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing about
money is it's actually

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
an unwillingness
to receive, which

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is really interesting
because you think,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:90%
no, it's about money.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
No, it's actually about what
you're unwilling to receive.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as a money issue.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:84%
There's only what you're
unwilling to receive,

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
which is why you look at some
people who are mean and unkind

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.104 align:middle line:84%
but they're really
good with money,

00:29:55.104 --> 00:29:56.870 align:middle line:84%
because they're willing to
receive money because they

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:90%
don't have a judgment of it.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
For most of us who are looking
to create change in the world,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
somewhere we got this
idea that money is bad,

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and money is wrong.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And money shouldn't be
part of the equation.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So we literally eliminate
it from our lives.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.557 align:middle line:90%
We're not willing to receive it.

00:30:10.557 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you could do.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So-- well, we might
get [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But here's what you can do
is, OK, so everything that I

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
decided that money is bad for
money is wrong, everything that

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.780 align:middle line:84%
makes me refuse to receive it,
we now destroy and uncreate it,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
right and wrong, good and
bad, pod and pok, all nine

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:90%
shorts, boys and beyonds.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm starting
to think of things where

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
past, childhood, all these
memories start to flood

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:84%
in where I wouldn't be
willing to receive it,

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.320 align:middle line:84%
don't feel worthy,
all that stuff.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.884 align:middle line:84%
Then I just start to clear
it, and you start to clear it.

00:30:38.884 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you start to clear it.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.861 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to take a
lot more than one of these.

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
-Of course.
-Clear it.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And then run the same exact
thing again because it'll

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.240 align:middle line:90%
clear the next layer.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And then run it again.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.837 align:middle line:84%
And it'll clear the next layer.
And run it again.

00:30:48.837 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:90%
And it'll clear the next layer.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:84%
In about 20 or 30 times, I'll
ask you to think about money.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.354 align:middle line:84%
And you go, wow, it feels good
like that rainbow you were

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about with the space?

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah, right.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Imagine being able to have
that even around money.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
not necessarily

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
a problem in your world, but
for a lot of people out there--

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can see that, absolutely.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.187 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
start changing it.

00:31:09.187 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how you start
changing all sorts of things.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at Dain here,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dain, in action
teaching a class on clearing

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:90%
issues around money.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you realize
that, oh my gosh,

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle line:84%
there's a generosity
that would be available

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:84%
if I allowed myself not to have
to struggle with money anymore.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think what most
of us have been doing

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is we've been making ourselves
have just enough, or just

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
enough plus a little bit,
to believe that we're not

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.775 align:middle line:84%
the force and source of change
in the world that we are,

00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're not the contribution
to change in the world

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.812 align:middle line:84%
that we are, that we're not
the creators that we are,

00:31:44.812 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're not the destroyers
of limitation that we are.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So how much have you
used money to prove

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
every limited point
of view about you

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.490 align:middle line:90%
that you've been choosing?

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.057 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is,
times a gazillion,

00:31:56.057 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
will you destroy it
and uncreate it please?

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.386 align:middle line:84%
Right and wrong, good
and bad, pod and pok,

00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
all nine in shots, boys and
beyonds How much have you

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
used money as the
anti-joy in your life

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than the contribution
to the expansion

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:90%
of joy in your life?

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
times a gazillion

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.885 align:middle line:84%
will you destroy and
uncreate it, please?

00:32:13.885 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Right and wrong, good and
bad, pod and pok, all nine

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:90%
shorts boys and beyonds.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you lie there
and you just take maybe 10,

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
15, maybe 20 minutes,
if it's fun, keep going.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But lie there and ponder what
you would choose in your life,

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and what you would choose
to contribute to the world

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
if you had $100 million
that replenished

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of every year.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And just play with
the energy of it.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And play with it.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then also ask, OK,
if no one in my life

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:84%
had to stay in my
life, if I could

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.125 align:middle line:84%
have a life without any of the
people I didn't want there--

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:45.982 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:45.982 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Now's not a good time
to look left and right.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that, OK?

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:84%
If you could have
that in addition,

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:90%
what would you choose?

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And just play with
the energies of that.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm asking you to
do it for at least three days

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is because the first
day it'll be one way.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
The second day you'll have
all kinds of other stuff

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
even think you could

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:84%
possibly contemplate having or
asking for in the second day.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And on the third day, it's going
to be different even still.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.990 align:middle line:84%
If you were to do
it for 21 days--

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
although asking a humanoid to
do that is just like, here,

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
why don't you
shave off your head

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and pull all your teeth out?

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm shaving off my-- um, yeah,
do you have, like, hair loss?

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.940 align:middle line:90%
No, I just shaved off my head.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
it, no problem.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's like that, asking
you to do it for 21 days.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So play with it for as
long as you want to.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's stupidity are you
using to create the money

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.060 align:middle line:90%
problem you are choosing.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.354 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is,
times a gazillion

00:33:49.354 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:84%
will you destroy and
uncreate it, please?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Right and wrong, good and bad,
pod and pok, all nine shorts,

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:54.114 align:middle line:90%
boys, and beyonds.

00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you who have
never heard about stupidity--

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:84%
because there are people out
there who will hear this who've

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
never heard about stupidity--
it's basically the places where

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:90%
you're making yourself unaware.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
use stupidity is

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
because notice that
charge that it brings

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:90%
up when we say stupidity?

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're using it, to
undo that charge so you don't

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:84%
ever have to resist and react
to functioning from unawareness

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
ever again, so you don't
have to choose to function

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:84%
from unawareness
ever again, so you

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
can actually have
awareness in this area

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.030 align:middle line:90%
rather than unawareness.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So what stupidity are
you using to create

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:90%
the money you are choosing?

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.224 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
times a gazillion,

00:34:26.224 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:84%
will you destroy and
uncreate it, please?

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.289 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Right and wrong, good and bad,
pod and pok, all nine shorts,

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:31.739 align:middle line:90%
boys, and beyonds.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:84%
That was great to
see because those

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.370 align:middle line:84%
clearing statements that we just
talked about were in the video.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.125 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
clearing statements

00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that apparently you can listen
to throughout the night.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.440 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes, that's one
of those wonderful things.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
you, but I did--

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I used to listen to-- when I
was going through the phase

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to kill myself
and everything else,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I used to listen to
subliminals as a way

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
of trying to change
things, except I didn't

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:90%
see much change in my life.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
With these, you can
literally put them on a loop

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and listen to them at night.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing
the energy of what

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:90%
has been keeping you stuck.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.441 align:middle line:84%
It's changing the bag of weights
that you've been carrying,

00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
you know the rocks?

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: The
subconscious mind.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and the
unconscious choices

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that we've made,
because what this does

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is-- the way the
clearing statement works,

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:90%
it's like the wall looks solid.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But science tells us
it's 99.999% space.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if the
limitations in our lives

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
are just the same
way, we just haven't

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
been able to see it that
way because of the choices

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:90%
we've made?

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:84%
What this does is it literally
is like going back and plucking

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:90%
the seed out of the ground.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine vaporizing
the seed from the limitation,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.820 align:middle line:90%
that's literally what it does.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So it takes all kinds of choices
that you make and creates

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that rainbow, rather
than the contraction

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.460 align:middle line:90%
that we normally function from.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So then it starts to dissolve
those false limitations that we

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%
put on ourselves around money.
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Around any other
limitation blocking us

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
from having relationships,
from having health.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, depression, I
mean, that's a big one.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.440 align:middle line:10%
You know, so many people
that come to Access are like,

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm just not happy.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:10%
And I know I should
be able to be.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, yeah exactly.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:10%
First tool I give them is,
who does this belong to?

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Because when I was given
this, one of the things that

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.680 align:middle line:10%
used to happen for
me 13 years ago was I

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.997 align:middle line:10%
would literally
lie in bed and cry.

00:36:17.997 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
When my girlfriend left for
work I'd lie in bed and cry

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:90%
until I had to go to work.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was given this tool,
who does this belong to?

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Put it on a yellow sticky
note by the girl who

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:90%
did my first Access session.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yeah, right,
like that'll work, you know?

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And I put it by my clock.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, a few days later I was
waking up in one of those moods

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:84%
again where I felt
like I couldn't do it,

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.350 align:middle line:84%
laying in bed
crying, looked over

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:84%
at the clock to see what time
it was and how long I had,

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
read who does this belong
to on a yellow sticky note

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:84%
without even realizing
I was reading it.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
vanished instantly--

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
the crying, the depression,
the idea that I couldn't do it.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I find it hard to believe
that a simple statement could

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.611 align:middle line:84%
actually unlock
that much energy.

00:36:55.611 --> 00:36:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So did I. And I think-- because
I'm not the brightest tool--

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.245 align:middle line:84%
see, I'm not the brightest
tool in the shed that's--

00:37:02.245 --> 00:37:03.045 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: A limitation.

00:37:03.045 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the sharpest
tool in the-- yeah.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, for me I have
to get things in a certain way

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.410 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason this happened
for me is so I would actually

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:90%
know how dynamic it could be.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Because I am the same way.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- I
thought, really, just

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
asking a question
like that can actually

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.760 align:middle line:90%
create that level of change?

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, there-- I do
think, though there's

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:90%
another layer to it.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe there
are other dimensions to this.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.960 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Shh!,
Don't tell anyone.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There's-- there's
something within the work,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.131 align:middle line:84%
the body of Access
Consciousness called the bars.

00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:37.670 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes.
LISA GARR: What is that?

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Oh, it's
32 points in the head.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They have names like
money, body, sexuality,

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:90%
joy, sadness, healing, power.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody holds
those points, what happens

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is it dissipates the
electromagnetic component

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of thought, judgement,
and limitation that you've

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:90%
been functioning from.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So was it
from an acupuncture,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.450 align:middle line:90%
or an energetic, or both?

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.116 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: It's an energetic.
LISA GARR: Energetic.

00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.520 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Now, some
of the bars have

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
corollaries in other techniques,
but most of them don't.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They were something that Gary
stumbled across 25 years ago

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
when he started
Access Consciousness

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and got the information for,
and started seeing that what

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
happened was rather than
people-- he just started seeing

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.360 align:middle line:90%
that it worked, basically.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was going
to say is in all of Access,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.974 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't work,
we don't do it.

00:38:21.974 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't say, here, let me
put my hands on your head.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't do anything.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.956 align:middle line:84%
And we have thousands
of people doing it.

00:38:25.956 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
No, 40 countries around the
world are actually using this.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It's been used in prisons.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's-- and what it does is
it literally gives you that

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:84%
sense of space,
you know like you

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.420 align:middle line:84%
said that rainbow around you?
LISA GARR: Yes, yes.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you
receive the bars.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh, it can
be this way to be alive.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like somebody
transporting you out

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.510 align:middle line:90%
into nature.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.044 align:middle line:84%
And you know how after you're
there for 20 minutes to two

00:38:47.044 --> 00:38:48.510 align:middle line:84%
hours, it feels like
the weight of the world

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.269 align:middle line:84%
comes off of your shoulders?
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:38:50.269 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
The bars creates that
effect in your life

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:90%
walking around right now.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:90%
After one session?

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:90%
15?

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you learn--

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.540 align:middle line:90%
For most people after one.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, why would
you not have it again?

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.515 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:39:03.515 --> 00:39:04.315 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right, right.

00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because each one releases a
certain amount of limitation

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.584 align:middle line:90%
that will never show up again.

00:39:08.584 --> 00:39:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But you've been
creating limitation

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
it is it literally--

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
like, there was a lady who
was given six weeks to live

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:84%
who a friend of hers said, look,
you need to get your bars run.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:90%
And she was in Australia.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And the lady had just
learned to run bars.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And so she went to the
lady's house, got her bars

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
run, forgot her shoes because
she was so excited to be alive.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:90%
She walked home.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And she literally had
not been able to walk

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.314 align:middle line:84%
more than 100 meters for
two years before that.

00:39:37.314 --> 00:39:38.571 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh my goodness.
I

00:39:38.571 --> 00:39:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the bars are
energetic access points.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Yes.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Specifically in the head.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.866 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes,
specifically in the head.

00:39:45.866 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That unlock
different-- there's

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:90%
about 40 points?

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:49.625 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 32.

00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:50.330 align:middle line:90%
32.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Can somebody learn how to
do this on somebody else?

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in fact you take an
Access Consciousness bars class,

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.080 align:middle line:84%
or if you take the being you
changing the world class that I

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
offer that's a 3
and 1/2 day class,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
the one day bars class
is incorporated in that.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And after that
one day class, you

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.340 align:middle line:84%
can actually go out and give
this gift to other people.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
You can do it for people.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, it's like people
who run it on their teenagers--

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I love getting emails where
somebody says, thank you,

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%
thank you, thank you.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.727 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this is.

00:40:18.727 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know how it works.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I did it on my teenage daughter.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And she has been a living holy
terror for the last three years

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
ever since she
became a teenager.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And now every time run her
bars I have three and a half

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.813 align:middle line:90%
weeks of peace in the house.

00:40:31.813 --> 00:40:33.235 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, you're welcome.

00:40:33.235 --> 00:40:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Three and a half weeks.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she's like, OK, I
need to run her bars every three

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and a half weeks
because it keeps working

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.270 align:middle line:90%
for three and a half weeks.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That's just what we've
noticed empirically.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, can you run
them on yourself?

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.820 align:middle line:84%
DAIN HEER: Yes, you can.
-Oh, you can.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things
that I love to give people

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in the classes that
I teach is teach them

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
how to run their money
bar, because there's

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:90%
one specifically for money.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And, literally,
what happens is--

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Can you show us?

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.695 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I could.

00:41:00.695 --> 00:41:01.695 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you want to do.

00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:03.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to take
three of your fingers,

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and right-- three
of your fingers

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.321 align:middle line:84%
up from this spot in
your ear right here.

00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea if I'm on
the right camera or not.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But right there, that's where
the money bar is located.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Right ear, OK.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.644 align:middle line:84%
Right there, and you
have one on each side.

00:41:14.644 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: On both sides, OK.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.776 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they're called bars

00:41:16.776 --> 00:41:18.120 align:middle line:84%
is because it's kind
like an energy bar

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:90%
that goes through your head.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And what you want to do is you
can hold your hands up there.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.171 align:middle line:90%
Or you can ask it to activate.

00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Holding your hands
up there is going

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:90%
to be more effective probably.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you do this every
night before you go to bed--

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and just keep your hands there
as long as you can-- literally

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.680 align:middle line:84%
within three months, maybe
shorter maybe longer,

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll have an awareness
about money that will change

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:90%
your stress about it forever.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.845 align:middle line:84%
-That is a huge claim.
-I know.

00:41:46.845 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But, absolutely, what
have you got to lose?

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I know, exactly.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing is, even if you
don't do it consistently enough

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't happen,
what you're going to notice

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.497 align:middle line:84%
is your stress around
money will start to change.

00:41:58.497 --> 00:42:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact that you're just
putting your attention on it

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:05.120 align:middle line:84%
every single night in a
neutral way in and of itself

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:90%
could create a lot of awareness.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I don't
care how it happens.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I just want people
to have the change.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Where I was 13 years
ago is a place no one

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:90%
should have to get to, really.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And now I understand
that happened for you.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the reason
why I found out

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
about you is that so
many other people said

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:90%
that this is incredible work.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
This is an incredible feeling.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've just started
to learn about it.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We hear this from-- I
mean, somebody sent me

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
your book with a
card in it that said,

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
you really need to
check this guy out.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
another letter saying,

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:84%
you really need to check this--
DAIN HEER: Wow.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And then I got an email.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.210 align:middle line:90%
It's been over time.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.711 align:middle line:84%
And so people are experiencing
things that they want to share.

00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
What type of feedback have
you heard around the world?

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, exactly that,
that people say,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking to
change this for 20 years.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I got an e-mail just about
five days ago from a lady.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I put out a video that was just
giving some information that I

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.790 align:middle line:84%
found, because I love to do
that because this is the info I

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.360 align:middle line:84%
needed 13 years ago that it
wasn't out there at the time

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
that I could find.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I do this
free video series.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And this lady sent
me the coolest email.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:84%
She said, in just watching
your five-minute video,

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:84%
she said the 20 years of
wrongness about me that I've

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
been living in is gone.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.490 align:middle line:90%
It's vanished.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the possibility.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:84%
That's-- it actually
shows in this

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.330 align:middle line:84%
piece that you're
about to watch here,

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:90%
are the people's reactions.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And check out the
space that these people

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:90%
are in when you see them talk.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

You know there are
going to be 10,000

00:44:06.886 --> 00:44:08.371 align:middle line:84%
people at this thing
whose bodies need

00:44:08.371 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:90%
what we have to talk about?

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.843 align:middle line:84%
This unique information,
this stuff nobody else

00:44:10.843 --> 00:44:14.180 align:middle line:84%
says, listening to it, talking
to your body, changing things.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I am stoked.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.999 align:middle line:84%
Let's go show them
this so that they can

00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:17.965 align:middle line:90%
have a different possibility.

My name is Danielle Carter.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:90%
I live in St. George, Utah.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And before my first Access
classes with Dr. Dain,

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of
the time hiding.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And then most of the time,
I was hiding in my body.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I was a size 16 when I first
took my classes with Dr. Dain.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I went in five
months to a size five.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
If you want a tiny life, if
you want to hide, don't come.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
something bigger,

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.943 align:middle line:84%
something more expensive,
something wonderful,

00:44:53.943 --> 00:44:55.860 align:middle line:90%
something amazing, come.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And then after my private
sessions with Dr. Dain,

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that is when my life
just seemed to explode.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I walk through the world
in a different way.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Now everything is such a joy.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And I enjoy people.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy life.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy nature.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy being seen
and doing whatever.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I enjoy getting
attention, or something that I

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.050 align:middle line:90%
never wanted to do before.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was on the table,
I didn't really quite

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:18.860 align:middle line:90%
know what to expect.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And Dain didn't
even touch my body.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But what he did to the
energy flow of my body,

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.890 align:middle line:90%
it was really phenomenal.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You've generated a lot of
miracles in people's lives,

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.000 align:middle line:84%
changed a lot of
things in their bodies.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.030 align:middle line:90%
How did that occur for you?

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I really have Gary
to thank for that.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.390 align:middle line:84%
He was the first
person who had or did

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:47.170 align:middle line:84%
anything that truly desired me
to be as great as I could be.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Gary walks into my office.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
just follow the energy.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And do what my body tells you.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.050 align:middle line:90%
You'll know what to do.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing across
the room at one point,

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.800 align:middle line:84%
probably 15 feet away
from him, doing this.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's flopping on
the table like a fish.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you see a
shaman, or like the wizard

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I don't
know Harry Potter

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.260 align:middle line:90%
or something, with the wand.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm the one doing it?

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.360 align:middle line:90%
It blew my mind.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where and when
I started stepping

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:84%
into doing this work that I
do, this energetic synthesis

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
of being stuff.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I realized I had this ability
to work with the bodies.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I was working
on one person's body.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew
it, I was working

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:90%
on six people at a time.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.460 align:middle line:84%
That went from six
people, to 12, to 24,

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to 48, and eventually
to 150 people

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.110 align:middle line:90%
all in a room at the same time.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Basically, there's
no words for it.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.875 align:middle line:90%
It's just this big whoa.

00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:45.645 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.645 --> 00:46:50.624 align:middle line:84%
It's like this energy
that just goes through you.

00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of shows you
what else is possible,

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.911 align:middle line:84%
which you wouldn't allow
yourself to see normally.

00:46:57.911 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's like peace as well.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The energy, space, joy, it was
a scream of life, fantastic.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.030 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE: Are you ever going
to be the same person?

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Never, how can--
it's not possible.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You are entering a
different level of life,

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:84%
different level of
space, a different level

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dave.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So as part of this, we
have the Kids for Change,

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Inc. One of things that's
really close to my heart,

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.060 align:middle line:84%
near and dear to me, is
giving kids the opportunities

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:84%
they need to create a different
future and a different world

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:84%
than the world we have thus
far been able to create.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do is give
them everything possible that

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
gives them the fighting
chance and the tools they need

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to change not only their lives
and have everything they'd love

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to have, and love to
be, show up, but also

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.350 align:middle line:90%
the tools to change the world.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So here's the thing
you got to get.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.520 align:middle line:84%
You are the
contribution for change

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that the planet requires.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.006 align:middle line:84%
If you don't choose it,
no one else is going to.

00:48:08.006 --> 00:48:10.421 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So you could call
that, basically,

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:90%
a lightness of being.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really does
allow people to shift.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So do they stay in that
space after months?

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.471 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have to
keep coming back?

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most of
them report-- here's

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the way it usually
works, is they say,

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, I used to
have bummer months.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it went
to bummer weeks.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And then now it's
like bummer days.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Or if something lasts longer
than a couple of hours,

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's a
really big issue.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is I had
so many people tell me,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:84%
once you do this, you will
be holy, and anointed.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And you will be happy forever.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no, I kind
of still want to kill myself.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to make--
tell anybody anything other

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.090 align:middle line:84%
than there is this choice--
this other possibility

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:90%
that's available.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've noticed
with the people that do Access

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is the general level of
lightness in their life,

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the general level of rainbow
in which they walk around just

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.770 align:middle line:84%
starts increasing, and
increasing, and increasing,

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:10.810 align:middle line:90%
and gets more dynamic.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about it is they actually

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:16.060 align:middle line:84%
have the tools to handle
the situations of life that

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.790 align:middle line:84%
come up because it
doesn't mean, oh,

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.110 align:middle line:90%
bad stuff is going to happen.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Or it doesn't mean that
you're not going to go down.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just you'll
stay there less.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It'll be less of a deep slope
d And you'll be able to get

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:90%
out of it a lot quicker.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So you start to actually
have more joy and more peace.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.507 align:middle line:84%
And you also don't have to
avoid anymore all that stuff

00:49:34.507 --> 00:49:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that you've been trying to
avoid that you're afraid of.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.320 align:middle line:84%
When you get a
little taste of that,

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:90%
then you want more of that.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Exactly.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:42.520 align:middle line:84%
When you get a little
taste of, oh my gosh,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I just spent some time
with the relative who you

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:90%
used to always bring me down.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.260 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, that person
doesn't bring me down.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.130 align:middle line:90%
This might be working.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Let me find out what
the next level is.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.800 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right, exactly, yeah.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I find happening.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think you were
attracted to all of this?

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's a
really great question.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I just know I've been
a seeker my whole life.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those people who has
always been looking, because I

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:90%
knew there was more available.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of it is
I'm so grateful because I'm

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.560 align:middle line:90%
actually living it.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually
facilitating other people

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and being able to live it.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Not-- once again, not in a
cave, not just in the classroom,

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:84%
not just in the access
class, but in their lives.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a lady called
me because her daughter

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.730 align:middle line:84%
had this headache that she's
had for the last three days.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was so intense
that she's been in bed.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so,
let's ask a question.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that actually hers?

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, this who does this
belong to concept again.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And she went, oh
my gosh, I said,

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:84%
has anything happened
in her life recently?

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:84%
She went, oh my gosh, her dad
just fell and hit his head

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and was in the
hospital bleeding.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.194 align:middle line:84%
And I went, you think
she might be trying

00:50:47.194 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:90%
to help him out and heal him?

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
little girl-- I said,

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.060 align:middle line:84%
will you put her on
the phone, please?

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, let me ask
you a question.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Are you trying to heal dad?

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And she went, yes.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.437 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:50:55.437 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
does your head feel?

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:84%
She went, oh, it's
getting better.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel it lighten
up and go from that-- you know

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that contraction when
somebody is in pain,

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and when they want to
shut out the world?

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Start to get to that rainbow
that you talked about in three

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.220 align:middle line:90%
minutes on the phone.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Within two more minutes,
she was running around happy

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.660 align:middle line:90%
listening to music.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been in
bed for three days.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:15.879 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:51:15.879 --> 00:51:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of
thing I see all the time.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
something I can do,

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.290 align:middle line:84%
not just something
I can facilitate.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something I want
to give other people

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the tools so they can
do it in their lives

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.510 align:middle line:90%
with the people they love.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean you
wrote a book called

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.350 align:middle line:90%
"Being You Changing the World."

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you might be up to
something bigger than that.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping so.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean that's
the general point of view.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.405 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if you
truly get to be you,

00:51:38.405 --> 00:51:40.330 align:middle line:84%
you have that energy
of that lightness.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can be it
in every situation.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So changing the
world-- how would this

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.110 align:middle line:84%
change the world
situation that we're

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.670 align:middle line:90%
in, our economic situation?

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well here's the thing.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.750 align:middle line:84%
If you can actually get people
to come out of judgment--

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.470 align:middle line:84%
because what
judgment does is when

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.980 align:middle line:84%
you make a judgment nothing
that doesn't match your judgment

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.410 align:middle line:90%
can come into your awareness.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you judge this is
a bad financial situation,

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:90%
that's all you can see.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can get people to
come out of judgment, come

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.430 align:middle line:84%
into question where they
go, OK, the judgment is not

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:11.540 align:middle line:90%
working to create what I want.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:90%
What else is possible?

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.970 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than this?

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And then to have people go,
OK, so everything that doesn't

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.370 align:middle line:84%
allow me to change this
money situation right now,

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.650 align:middle line:84%
destroy and uncreate it,
right and wrong, good and bad,

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:84%
pod and pok, all nine
shorts and boys and beyonds.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So doing that-- do you
see how just in that one--

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in three minutes,
you can actually

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.620 align:middle line:84%
change your entire point
of view which gives you

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.620 align:middle line:90%
a different sense of the space.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And what the world really
needs is a lot more of us

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.370 align:middle line:84%
with a lot more space
because those that desire

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:41.950 align:middle line:90%
it will be attracted to you.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They will want to know
what you're doing.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And like this little
girl for example,

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:84%
the next time one
of her friends is

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
having a stomach ache because
she's trying to heal her mom.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.399 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.640 align:middle line:84%
She can go up to her
because she's got credibility

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:90%
because she's her friend.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.121 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, is it possible you're
trying to heal someone else?

00:52:55.121 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean?
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:84%
If the friend is
open to hear it.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you are trying to heal
someone else, what do you do?

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.190 align:middle line:90%
You pull back that energy?

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:84%
No, actually what
you do is you say,

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.960 align:middle line:84%
hey, body thank you
so much, and thank you

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.920 align:middle line:84%
for giving me the awareness
and the information.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you please do this
without hurting us?

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask your body
to do it in a different way.

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And what's weird
is your body will.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that as a mother.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would of course use
my energy to heal something

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:22.497 align:middle line:90%
that would hurt my child.

00:53:22.497 --> 00:53:23.230 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Absolutely.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:24.600 align:middle line:90%
So how do you pull that back?

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you do is
you ask-- that could

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:29.960 align:middle line:90%
be it's own show, really.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- so the real simple
answer is, number one,

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.610 align:middle line:90%
see what's actually going on.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And see if you can
shift it in their world

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.620 align:middle line:84%
because if they no
longer choose it

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
try to take it away

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:44.470 align:middle line:84%
using some of these questions,
like what are you sick of?

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.150 align:middle line:84%
If that is not an option,
what you do is you go body,

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:48.637 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's obvious
we're going to keep

00:53:48.637 --> 00:53:49.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to heal this
person because we

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.120 align:middle line:90%
really care about them.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Can you please do
it in a way that's

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.070 align:middle line:90%
less invasive and less painful?

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And your body is like, sure,
nobody asked me before.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Sure, I can do that,
because your body

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.560 align:middle line:90%
has consciousness too.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to
put Access Consciousness

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to the test a little bit here.
DAIN HEER: Please.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you some questions

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.030 align:middle line:84%
because I know that
you can handle it.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So what would your
reaction to someone

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.110 align:middle line:84%
be that came to you
that said, you know,

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.791 align:middle line:84%
I just suddenly lost
the death of a child.

00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:90%
DAIN HEER: Right.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:20.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I mean I'm really
going to put you to the test

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.060 align:middle line:84%
here because I want
to see how it works.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So the first
question I would ask

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, so you have this
child who just passed.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Can an infinite being truly die?

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:31.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, so have you lost the being?

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Or have you lost their body?

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And can you acknowledge also
that because of you're caring

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.890 align:middle line:84%
for them, because of your
desire to see their dreams

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.160 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled probably
in a way greater

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.770 align:middle line:84%
than what you were even able
to create, that this one hurts.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And this one sticks.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you please
acknowledge that it's OK?

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And then what I would do
is I would run their bars.

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
them talk about it.

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.063 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I've done this.

00:54:55.063 --> 00:54:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I literally had
a lady come to me

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.470 align:middle line:90%
who had lost her teenage son.

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:03.760 align:middle line:90%
And it was killing her.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she had been not
going out of her house

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:90%
for over three months.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was destroying her.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.840 align:middle line:84%
She could hardly
walk when she got

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.410 align:middle line:90%
to me she was that depressed.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said here,
sweetie lie down.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just touched her real
gently and put my hands on her.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.551 align:middle line:84%
And I said, tell me everything
that's going on, please.

00:55:19.551 --> 00:55:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And I sat there.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I ran her for
over two hours.

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.530 align:middle line:90%
And she got up.

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And she had tears in her eyes.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time I'd seen her smile

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:90%
since she'd been there.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And she started having
that rainbow you talk

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.740 align:middle line:90%
about, the energy that she was.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And she gave me a hug.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And she cried.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And she said, thank you.

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm actually
going to live.

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.944 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how I was
going to get through this.

00:55:39.944 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know when
she walked in the door

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.210 align:middle line:90%
how you were going-- oh, my God.

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:45.030 align:middle line:84%
No, and she said,
I didn't know how I

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.800 align:middle line:90%
was going to get through this.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what we were
going to do when she came in.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.024 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to gift
somebody that-- so that's

00:55:53.024 --> 00:55:54.590 align:middle line:84%
where I would go with
that particular question.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah, is to give.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So your desire to
help people get out

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.610 align:middle line:84%
of pain they come to you--
attracts many people to come

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.140 align:middle line:90%
to you with a lot of pain.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you have an infinite
amount to give to people?

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Does it ever take
away from Dain?

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:90%
There are times where it has.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I
love about this is I'm

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.900 align:middle line:84%
always in a constant state of
change as a result of this.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
give somebody a tool

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:19.550 align:middle line:84%
or ask them to do it
if I hadn't done it.

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason I have the life
that I have, of sense of ease

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of energy
and the sense of joy,

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.190 align:middle line:84%
is because I use these very
tools that I give other people.

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are times
where it has, where

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.780 align:middle line:90%
it's really made my body tired.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:34.767 align:middle line:84%
And I find out what it is that's
creating that, and change it.

00:56:34.767 --> 00:56:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's that I've
just been working too hard.

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And my body is going,
shut up, stupid.

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Stop working so hard.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll change that.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:41.403 align:middle line:90%
Could be that simple.

00:56:41.403 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it could be that simple.

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, so it's-- what
I realize is we have a far

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.300 align:middle line:84%
greater capacity and
a far greater energy

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.680 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever acknowledged.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.100 align:middle line:90%
It's time to tap into it.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.130 align:middle line:90%
The world needs us.

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we have just
like a minute left.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much more that
I know that we want to get to.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you could just tell me
one last piece about Access

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that you want people to know
that I haven't asked you,

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:90%
can you tell me?

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:05.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, for me, it would
be, what if you truly

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.740 align:middle line:10%
could change
anything in your life

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.190 align:middle line:10%
that you've wanted to change?

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:10.670 align:middle line:10%
What if these things that
are the money situations,

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.890 align:middle line:10%
and the relationship situations,
and the places where you've

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:10%
been abused or are being
abused, all that stuff what

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.730 align:middle line:10%
if it's actually pointing
you in the direction

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:20.090 align:middle line:10%
of your greatness?

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:21.840 align:middle line:84%
What if it's pointing
you in the direction

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.200 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that there are
totally different possibilities

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.140 align:middle line:90%
available?

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And what if you can
change all of it?

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And what if you truly being
are the gift and the change

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:32.750 align:middle line:90%
this world requires?

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
way to look at it.

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's an absolute
perspective shifter .

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.571 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that a
perspective shifter.

00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that a word?
It's a perspective shifter.

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:45.331 align:middle line:84%
It's like turbocharging
your perspective

00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:46.030 align:middle line:90%
shift possibilities.

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:50.637 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yeah-- and so being
in this state all the time--

00:57:50.637 --> 00:57:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of course, if you're
in that light state

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.270 align:middle line:84%
then you're able to remember the
questions, and the statements,

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:56.320 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've learned a lot.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's a
lot more left to learn,

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and that you can explore
these different opportunities

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and Access Consciousness
on your own as well.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.420 align:middle line:84%
