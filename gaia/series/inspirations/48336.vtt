00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.919 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting from
the Conscious Life Expo

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
here in Los Angeles,
and joining me again

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:90%
is Marianne Williamson.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
She is running for
Congress for the US

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
House of Representatives,
and she is here again

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
new conversation

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that people are
having, that Americans

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.111 align:middle line:84%
particularly, are
having about politics.

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're back.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.871 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we caught you here
in the middle of everything

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing and
your entire campaign.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.739 align:middle line:84%
So a few things have
changed since the last time

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've spoken
here on Gaiam TV.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Henry Waxman is
no longer running.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.582 align:middle line:84%
How did that impact your
campaign, or did it?

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well,
it certainly changes

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
the landscape.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
The molecules are different.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.909 align:middle line:10%
Congressman Waxman has
been there for 38 years.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:10%
>> WILLIAMSON: And so I was
running against an incumbent.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:10%
And now whoever is elected will
be a first-term congressperson.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
So it's different.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:10%
There are two new
candidates since he

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.372 align:middle line:10%
announced his retirement.

00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And there
will be probably more.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: There might be.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%
There absolutely might be.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.236 align:middle line:90%
So it's different.

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no better or worse.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.735 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
bit different.

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But my message was not tailored
to Congressman Waxman's being

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
in office, and it's not tailored
to his not being in office.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking about something
that's the same message before

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and the message now.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to change.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Which is?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: I feel that there
has been a very undemocratic

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
trend in the United States
over the last few years.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
We've got shrinking
civil liberties, things

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.693 align:middle line:84%
that every American
should be very concerned

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:53.981 align:middle line:84%
about, whether it's the domestic
spying or the National Defense

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Authorization Act that allows
the government to indefinitely

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
detain US citizens-- I don't
think most Americans are really

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
focusing on what that means--
drones that will be here

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.924 align:middle line:90%
in two years.

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Drones?

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.215 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: So
there's a shrinking--

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
drones are the
unmanned aircraft.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Which, you know, drones,
when you think of the drones

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
as they're used in
other countries,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%
they have this radar, right?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So when the drones
get here, they

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
could know, Lisa, who
you're sleeping with

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and what room you
just walked into

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and what you're logging
onto on your computer.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we're being
told that they're

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.165 align:middle line:84%
going to be used by
amazon.com and FedEx

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and by law enforcement
to catch the bad guys

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and that we shouldn't worry
about privacy because they will

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
have to adhere to all state and
local and federal privacy laws.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:90%
But in--

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Whatever those are.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: --the days of NSA
spying when we're already told

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
we're spying on
your phone calls,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Americans on
the left and the right--

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
this has nothing to do
with left or right--

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Americans are
saying, what is going on here?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.881 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
shrinking civil liberties,

00:02:54.881 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we have expanding
corporate influence,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and we have domestic
surveillance.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:90%
So these form a very toxic brew.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a real poison.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
You can either have
a democracy or not.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a democracy
and you care about that,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
then you want to really
think very strongly

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
about the kind of changes
that are being made here.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We're currently basically making
a mockery of the Gettysburg

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Address.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when
Lincoln said we were

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
a government of the people, by
the people, and for the people

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and that those men had
died in that battle

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
so that a government of
the people, by the people,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and for the people would
not perish from the earth,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
perishing, because we've

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
become a government
of a few of the people

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and by a few of the people
and for a few the people.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And those moneyed interests
represented by that,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
moneyed interests influence
our political functioning

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
so disproportionate

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to the influence that is
wielded by the average citizen

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
as to form of real
crisis of our democracy.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So if you get into
this office and you see these

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
moneyed corporate interests in
your environment and that you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
have a direct ability to
make an impact on this,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:90%
what will you do?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:90%
How will you start?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, I would
be one of 435 congresspeople,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and there are, in the
Senate and in the House,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
people already working towards
a constitutional amendment that

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
would outlaw the undo influence
of money on our politics

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and declare that corporations do
not have the right personhood.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.985 align:middle line:84%
Just the other day there was
a bill introduced in the House

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that has to do
with an issue that

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.193 align:middle line:84%
would have to do with
making certain amounts

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:84%
of political contributions tax
deductible, which they aren't

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
now, matching funds
from the government.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is a conversation
that's already happening.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Many Americans are
looking around and going,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
who does this country
belong to anymore?

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.565 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
From a perspective

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of transformational, we
understand about subconscious

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
forces, and we have
subconsciously recreated

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
an aristocracy.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And this country was founded
to repudiate an aristocracy,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.944 align:middle line:84%
and we need to
repudiate it again.

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this country
should belong

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to the people of
the United States.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.738 align:middle line:84%
The people of the United
States should not just

00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
be receiving the crumbs
that are left over

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
after multinational corporate
interests have basically

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:90%
taken whatever they want.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That's not what America
is supposed to be.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's also a loss
of our civil liberties

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:90%
to the corporations.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you about
where you came from.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.864 align:middle line:84%
You started off as a teacher
of A Course in Miracles,

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: I still am a
teacher of Course in Miracles.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.821 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so how are you
infusing that conversation?

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Your roots from what you
wrote, A Return to Love,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.447 align:middle line:84%
and your best-selling book
on-- how are you infusing that

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:90%
into the political conversation?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, I believe
there's one truth spoken

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
in many different ways, whether
it's A Course in Miracles

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.561 align:middle line:84%
or any other serious spiritual
path, path of personal growth,

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
recovery, spirituality,
and all that.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the issues
is that a person

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is as sick as their
secrets, as they say in AA.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, so is a nation.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And because for
the last 30 years

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.029 align:middle line:84%
I've been up close and
personal with people in crisis,

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
basically-- I always
say people don't

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
come to me because
things are going well.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.443 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: So we
know about crisis,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and we know that in order to
transition out of a crisis,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a deep inquiry
into who you are and what

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
you're doing and whether you are
aligned with the principles you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
believe in and where you need
to change and where you need

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to atone and where you need to
make amends and where you need

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:90%
to course-correct.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think America, those same
principles of consciousness

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that rule an individual's
life rule a national life,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:84%
because all that a nation is
is a group of individuals.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
America has to now enter into
a deep inquiry into who we are.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why politics,
as Gandhi said,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.972 align:middle line:90%
politics should be sacred.

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It should be the place where
we're having the deepest

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
conversation, and it
is instead a place

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
where we have the most
shallow conversation.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I know, two
people, let's get down,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
let's have a real
conversation, Lisa.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Let's really
get down and have an authentic

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.557 align:middle line:90%
conversation on what's true.

00:06:42.557 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We know what that does
for our relationship.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: We know
what that does for you.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:90%
We know what it does for me.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
Politics should be--

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It makes us deeper--

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
--where have that--

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.925 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It makes
us more connected.

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: --same
authentic powerful conversation

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.374 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It doesn't even feel to
me like that would be possible.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well,
it is possible.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it right now.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it here.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.004 align:middle line:84%
In every campaign event that
I am part of, I'm so grateful.

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I feel there's a real listening
from people who want that.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:90%
We yearn for that.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
tell you, people

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
want it in Washington, too.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.424 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the system
that has been forged--

00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's not set
up for that, yeah.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.256 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, I don't
know if it's not set up

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
for that, but it has become
because of the dominance

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
of money that politicians
feel they need in order to get

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:90%
elected and to stay elected.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
But we can change that.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.396 align:middle line:84%
You change things one
conversation at a time.

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What conversations are
you having with the people that

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
are supporting you or even
that you're hearing from

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in Washington?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they having
this conversation?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Many people in
America are aware that we are

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:90%
in crisis.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.727 align:middle line:84%
Many people are
aware that huge oil

00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
companies and
pharmaceutical companies

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and health insurance companies
and big agricultural companies

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and prison industrial
complex companies

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:84%
and military
contractors-- people-- I

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.413 align:middle line:84%
don't care if you're on
the right or on the left.

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
This is not a right/left issue
at the deepest-- are like,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
appreciate-- and that's,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.095 align:middle line:84%
of course, the reason I'm
running as an independent is

00:08:04.095 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
because I think that if
you're unshackled by the dogma

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
or doctrine or rules of any
particular political party,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and if you're running a
grassroots campaign, as I am,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
where you're not getting
corporate PAC money,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
you can just say it.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel in this part
of my career what

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I've felt for 30
years in what I do.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt
I'm saying anything

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.371 align:middle line:90%
everybody I know isn't saying.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: I'm just saying
it with a microphone on.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Everywhere I go,
people are nodding their head.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
experience and this.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.826 align:middle line:90%
We're all thinking it.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.258 align:middle line:90%
We're all thinking it.

00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
We got to just start saying it.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.599 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the campaign funding

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and how you are
going to tackle that.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.265 align:middle line:84%
Because running a campaign,
as you're experiencing,

00:08:39.265 --> 00:08:40.133 align:middle line:90%
is not inexpensive.

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: No,
it's expensive.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It's very expensive.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But my campaign is a
grassroots campaign,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and my average donation is $51.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.889 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's a beautiful
thing, a grassroots campaign.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:90%
You're not taking--

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Is it working?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: --PAC money.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.561 align:middle line:84%
I have made enough
money that I think

00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
you'd call it a
credible campaign.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.046 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Definitely
a credible campaign.

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Whether we will
become competitive,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.195 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
buying television ads

00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
a little further down the road.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.125 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:08.912 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: I hope that
people will give in the way

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:90%
that will make that possible.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I will need to
be a competitive campaign.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.135 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
interesting, Lisa,

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
because for people who
can afford to give $2,600,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
anybody who can
afford to give $2,600

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
is already at a
level of experience

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
where they know how
important it is to.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The people I need to be
involved are the people

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
who don't think their
$10 will matter.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
My $10 won't matter or
my $20 won't matter.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:90%
But yes, it will.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You could sign up to give $5 a
month for the next four months,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and it does matter.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I think, you know,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in so many areas from the
transformational community

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we are aware how important
it is to invest your energy,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.469 align:middle line:90%
and money is just energy.

00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: But with your dollars.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Yes, exactly.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
talk about getting money

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:90%
on a metaphysical level.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the
power of investing money

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:90%
on a metaphysical level.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want anybody
to go beyond what

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:90%
is comfortable for them.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody does--
if your heart resonates

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
with this campaign
and making love

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
the bottom line and
humanitarian values

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than economic
values the bottom line

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that
democracy is important,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
not just from a
political perspective

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
but from a philosophical
perspective, because it's

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
the greatest context
we've come up

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.505 align:middle line:84%
with yet for self-actualization,
what happens when people are

00:10:24.505 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
allowed to be, just allowed
to be the miracles that

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
can happen, I just
hope anybody who does

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
feel that there's truth to that
sends me whatever, even if it's

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:90%
$5.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
That's all part of
the energy field.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you've said that,
and that's what the nature

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle line:84%
of the grassroots campaign
is, which I think is honorable

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and amazing that you're able
to-- you're actually doing it.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
You actually are doing it.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.917 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke with you several
months ago, it was a plan,

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and now it's working,
and it's great--

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Now had I--

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --hear that.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.398 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
--already announced?

00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I think I had.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Just.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Of course I had.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You had just.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Just announced.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.463 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Just.

00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Just announced.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --a week after you did.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you, then, when
there are other people running

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.080 align:middle line:84%
for this office that are
funding $7, $8 million

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
of their own money and
winning votes because

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of their popular circles
that they float in,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
how do you deal with
that when you're here

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:90%
doing the grassroots campaign?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What is your plan?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.838 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: I know Lisa Garr.

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:19.112 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I got $5.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: We compensate.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it's your
media presence.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.214 align:middle line:84%
Really, buzz compensates
for material lack.

00:11:29.214 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Got it.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: First of all, the
gentleman who was able to put

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
$7 million, we don't know
if he's running this time.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.052 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:11:35.052 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: But
quite seriously,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I think conviction is
a force multiplier,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and I think that it's the
ideas of this campaign.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:90%
That's our wealth.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Conviction
is a force multiplier.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: It is the idea.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:90%
It is the message.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
It is the fact that, you know,
we had slavery in this country,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:90%
but we abolished it.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
We had a lack of women's
suffrage in this country,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:90%
but suffrage was created.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
We had segregation in
the American South,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
but the Civil Rights
Movement changed that.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a
critical mass of Americans

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
is forming now, knowing
that now, as in those cases,

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
a terrible breach between
what democracy should mean

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and what was then
occurring or is now

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
occurring, that breach
is now in existence.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to be the
first generation of Americans

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to wimp out on doing
what needs to be done

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to take our democracy back
to where it needs to be.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So this is very important.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:90%
This is critical stuff.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
dismantling of democracy here,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.844 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
people who are really

00:12:37.844 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:84%
thinking about it
would agree with that.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.718 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I will tell you
that I was very disempowered

00:12:41.718 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
in my political conversation
before beginning my last couple

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:90%
of months of speaking with you.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And because of your passion
and because of how well-spoken

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you are and because of how
easily you relate to me,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel, as a woman, now
empowered in a conversation

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:90%
that I had no place in before.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have read, and
I feel that there's

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
a difference that I can
make, in that I can actually

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
hold my own in this
conversation with you now.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I am grateful
to you for that.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm
not the only one,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have helped
many people just like me.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: You know,
your saying that, to me,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
that's the success
of this campaign.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Because quite
a few people have said that,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and it is an issue of ownership.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
You didn't own that
conversation because you

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
had been this
almost, like, miasma

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
of not really recognizing--
you don't own the conversation

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
because you feel at the deepest
level you don't own America.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize we're all
supposed to own America--

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
this country is supposed
to belong to its people,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and part of what's happened
in the last few years that's

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
so dangerous to our
democracy is that it's

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
begun to be played
like a spectator sport.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.870 align:middle line:84%
You were just
watching other people

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:90%
who do the political thing.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: That's
very dangerous,

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
got to where we are.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.515 align:middle line:90%
Too many people disengage.

00:13:55.515 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You are the last person
who should be disengaged.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like a thief is
stealing our democracy,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
but we're realizing we
left the windows open,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and we left the doors open.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if a woman
like Lisa Garr

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have her eye
of the ball, especially

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.505 align:middle line:84%
us as women, but all of us,
particularly those of us who

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:16.399 align:middle line:84%
have felt, well, it's so
toxic, it's so unconscious--

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That my vote
couldn't make a difference,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.981 align:middle line:84%
that I could write
my congressperson.

00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I would never ever expect
them to read what I wrote.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.184 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was the
way I was feeling.

00:14:24.184 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But you said, no,
that's not true.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: No, somebody
in the office does read it.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Somebody does, yeah.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And I
know that you will.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: And now you have
the opportunity to actually

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
support a candidacy of someone
aligned with your thinking.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not I win
is simply a matter of

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
whether or not enough
people collaborate

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
in creating the force that
is necessary to actually win

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:90%
the votes on election day.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really is simpler
than we sometimes make it.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.322 align:middle line:84%
If people step up, then
we'll make this happen.

00:14:55.322 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Let me
ask you about that.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
What if this doesn't
work out in this level?

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Would you take on to
another political running?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.734 align:middle line:90%
Would you run for mayor?

00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, I
wouldn't run for mayor.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be a good mayor.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be a good governor.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are managerial
positions that it would not

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
be my skillset, actually, so
I would not be doing that.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the power
of this campaign is its ideas.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
difference, as we know,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
spiritually and metaphysically
between form and content.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%
So the content is strong here.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether the form is such that it
turns into an electoral victory

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and I get to go to the
House of Representatives,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I hope that happens.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be
good for all of us.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.455 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be
a great platform

00:15:36.455 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of the
things we care about.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll help create a lot
more space around the country

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
for other people who wish these
kind of independent messages.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
If not, though, I know
something has been ignited here.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
wish to serve it.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The universe isn't going
to stop its unfoldment

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because one person
goes here or there.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So I will do at any
given time what I--

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Are doing now.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.512 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: --feel in my
heart is perhaps the way I

00:16:02.512 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:90%
could serve best.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you are a catalyst
for change in many ways,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and this campaign is a catalyst
for change in many ways,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.122 align:middle line:84%
because you've started
the conversation.

00:16:10.122 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
You have the spark
that has ignited

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:90%
the pink elephant in the room.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And that-- in my opinion, you've
already won by doing that,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:90%
because you really have.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, you have
200,000 followers on Twitter

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, 500,000 on
Facebook, hundreds of thousands

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
in the women's movement.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You have a large
momentum behind you

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.445 align:middle line:84%
of supporters of people
who are expressing--

00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and those are just
the people who

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
have liked you on those
particular environments.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of
thousands more who haven't.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Yes,
but in our community,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
we can't rest on that,
and I'll tell you why.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Our community, the
transformational community,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
has not developed the
habits of democracy.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Liking someone on
Facebook is not

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:90%
a vote on primary day, June 3.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very important.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.325 align:middle line:84%
Just saying to me, I really
support you-- Sometimes

00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
we say these days I
support you, and it

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean anything
other than I support you.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.052 align:middle line:84%
So that in itself will
not win this election.

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:10%
Winning this election
means to make

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:10%
sure you're registered to
vote on June 3, to talk

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:10%
to your friends, to go to
marianneforcongress.com,

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:10%
to look at all the
events we have going on,

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:10%
the public town halls,
the meetings on GMOs, food

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:10%
and health with John Robbins,
coming to the Thursday night.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Every Thursday night we do a
volunteer meeting-- 305 Rose

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Avenue in Venice--
and people showing up,

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
being part of the
field operation,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
going, talking to people
in different neighborhoods.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So liking something on
Facebook is absolutely not,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's an important
tweak of consciousness

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thank you.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.041 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Sending
out email lists, you know,

00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
we've talked to people and my
colleagues asking, will you?

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Reid Tracy did the
most beautiful letter--

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
it meant so much to me-- on
the Hay House newsletter,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and Wayne Dyer on
his newsletter.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Great.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.729 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: That's really--

00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Influence.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.811 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: --I support you.

00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and what does that actually
mean in terms of action?

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what would create it
happening, if it happens.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So let me ask you
about being a woman and running

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:90%
in this candidacy.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Yes.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you have held
some great conferences on women

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in politics, and you've always
been a really big advocate

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
What would you do in the
event you were treated--

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and you got the
congressional seat

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and you were discriminated
against by other Congress

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.041 align:middle line:90%
members as a woman in Congress?

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, even though
there are not nearly enough

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
women in Congress, only
20%, I don't think--

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I have not heard any of them
say that they feel discriminated

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
against as women.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you look
at the statistics,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:84%
if a woman is running for
political office against a man,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
she wins as often
as the man does

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.886 align:middle line:90%
because there are women voters.

00:18:51.886 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The place where
there's a problem

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
is that not enough
women are running.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, Lisa, for me,
the feminist conversation today

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
is not about, oh, I'm
not getting enough of.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
We need to be, as American
women now, talking about

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
how to wield the
power that we do have.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what our conversation
as women needs to be.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.801 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.801 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.571 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That went
right through my heart.

00:19:13.571 --> 00:19:14.413 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Good, baby, good.

00:19:14.413 --> 00:19:15.255 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, ma'am.

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
That's why I'm here.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right through my heart.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
that conversation,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about any
type of scrutiny.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're going to
get bad news, good news, all

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.564 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:19:27.564 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
What are your
feelings about that?

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
It's embarrassing,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
but when somebody does a bad
picture of you or something--

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and the press that
I've seen so far--

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
there was one the other
day that was snarky.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.168 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard, Lisa.

00:19:41.168 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a New Age guru,
lightweight, woo-woo thinker.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that enough
time has gone by now,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and the transformational
wisdom is

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.280 align:middle line:84%
sort of baked into the cake
of our public discourse

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.705 align:middle line:84%
so that now I think people
see through the ruse of that.

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
New Age guru is
just kind of used

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
as a label to trivialize and
peripheralize and minimize

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
your conversation.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you get--

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Categorize.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: --some of that.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I did read that
you've never worn a silk scarf

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.294 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:12.797 align:middle line:90%
Cut velvet.

00:20:12.797 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Cut velvet.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Silk I have.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.903 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Silk.

00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:16.774 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: But cut velvet.

00:20:16.774 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's great.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: This is where we
need to stand up for each other

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.125 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.626 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: And there's
nothing like other people

00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:90%
having your back.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
The other day there was
some article that came out--

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
else people need

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to know-- so an article
came out on a blog.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe it wasn't a blog.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.295 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
major newspaper,

00:20:33.295 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:90%
but it was the online version.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And so many times journalists
are so irresponsible these days

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.355 align:middle line:84%
that they just repeat
something or say

00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
something that's not even true.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So somebody said
something, and that's not

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:90%
what I had said at all.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:90%
That's when it's very painful.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I've read articles
about myself where I've thought,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
if I was reading this, I
wouldn't like me either.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's very painful when
you're caricatured as someone

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:90%
that you know you're not.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But what was significant
about this incident

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
was that they said
what they said,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
it was a total lie,
and then a gentleman

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
that I know wrote
in immediately.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
How dare you call
yourself a journalist?

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what she said,
not what you said.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
She actually said this, and
here's the source, the article.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
You said she had this many of
this, but that's actually not.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Here's the source.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And he just laid into it.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And they changed it
immediately and apologized.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think too many
people don't realize that.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if somebody
something said to me about me

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that you know is
untrue and then there's

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.859 align:middle line:84%
a comment to the newspaper
from Lisa Garr, no kidding.

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: And that's
what's really beautiful.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's the power
of influence, though.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Not when
lies are said about you,

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
but when everybody even
who knows better is quiet.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.967 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all
learning about that now.

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means when
people say I've got your back.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Very important.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: We've got
to have each other's back,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:90%
particularly as women.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.381 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
some of your agendas

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:58.465 align:middle line:84%
on what you're planning on going
forward with if you're elected.

00:21:58.465 --> 00:21:59.215 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: OK.

00:21:59.215 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.091 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a couple
of issues here.

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.907 align:middle line:84%
We've got overturning
the Citizens United?

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, you can't
really overturn-- I mean,

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that could
overturn it is if we had

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.591 align:middle line:84%
a different Supreme Court and
there was actually a repeal

00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.144 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing that's in
the-- No congressperson gets

00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:90%
to make that decision.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But what, as a congressperson,
I can do, in addition to

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
co-sponsoring this bill
that Nancy Pelosi introduced

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the other day, which
is very exciting,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
called By the People bill,
I think it's called, which

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
does take a step forward,
but I want to help magnify

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
the message and the conversation
in Congress about starting

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
a constitutional
amendment, passing

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
a constitutional amendment
which will outlaw

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:84%
the undo influence of money and
establish that corporations do

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not have the rights
of personhood.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would
make my primary,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
underlying issue.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
what you start with.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Then we can
talk about child poverty,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the second highest
in all the advanced world.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
mass incarceration,

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:90%
which is highest in the world.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about so many
issues, the GMOs, the military,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.757 align:middle line:84%
so many things, but there's
an underlying cancer.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
There's an underlying issue
underlying all those issues,

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
influence of money.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
So anything related to that--

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That does
actually have to do with--

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: --that's
where I go first.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So just to rein
in the food companies,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:84%
like with the GMOs and so forth,
it goes back to the corporate

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:90%
interests, right?

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Right, exactly.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Goes back
to that issue.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Exactly.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
As long as they can spend
that many millions of dollars.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about halting
the extension of the Keystone

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Pipeline?

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.761 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Oh, it's
just tragic, isn't it?

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So the government comes out
with a report the other day,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
basically giving the president
a pass, if he chooses it.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.779 align:middle line:84%
It all feels like theater
right now, doesn't it?

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Because now we say, oh,
well, a government report

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
came out and said
it wouldn't really

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
contribute to carbon--
of course it will.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
We all know that it will.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Explain what
the Keystone Pipeline is.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: The Keystone
Pipeline, of course,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is the one that's going to send
all the oil from Canada from

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
the tar sands.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: This is the
fracking conversation?

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: No, that's
not a fracking conversation.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, it's different?

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: No, it is
different than the fracking

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And it absolutely increases
the carbon footprint,

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and the president had said
that he would not allow it

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
if it was proven by a government
report that it would increase.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.554 align:middle line:84%
And the report
basically says, well,

00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
if they don't send
it by pipeline,

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.344 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
send it by train

00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
anyway, which is not
necessarily true.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that those of us
who feel strongly about this,

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
at some point we've got
to just hold the line.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
This issue of climate
change and the relationship

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:84%
between the carbon and
the climate change,

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
this is a clear and present
danger at this point.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:90%
This is not even a debate.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We have an Energy and Commerce
Committee that wouldn't even

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
allow for hearings with
scientists talking.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And Congressman Waxman, who is
there now, has been a champion.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: He said,
let's have hearings.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's have scientists talk.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would not allow it
because the Republicans who

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
are in control
would not allow it.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.584 align:middle line:84%
The American people
must speak up,

00:25:00.584 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and the American
people are speaking up.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: But I,
as a congressperson,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:90%
would contribute to that voice.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we are the
only species that

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:90%
is destroying our own habitat.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, this is a very
important time in history

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
for you to be running
for that reason.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because there's such
an awareness now and a need.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is a global movement.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
This is not just--

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Absolutely.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --limited
to the United States.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.416 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beauty of it.

00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:27.405 align:middle line:84%
There's two million
environmental organizations

00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
If you could gather those
together and mobilize those,

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
then you've made a huge impact,
and you've started the ball.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, there are
so many of these organizations,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but there's a limit to what
we can do from the sidelines.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, at a
certain point, you say,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of just trying
to lobby my congressperson.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.678 align:middle line:90%
I think I just want their seat.

00:25:47.678 --> 00:25:50.235 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
running candidacies.

00:25:50.235 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We always think of ourselves
as trying to influence them.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:90%
No, we need to become them.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.755 align:middle line:90%
That's what I figured out.

00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:90%
That was my epiphany.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You were
just done, right?

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Just move over.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Let me
ask you a question.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You have been
responsible for starting

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
major organizations,
the Project Angel Food,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.529 align:middle line:90%
the Center for the Living.

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAMSON: Yes.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In your beginning of
those organizations,

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:84%
did you learn anything that
you would carry forward now

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
to running your
campaign, something

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
you would do differently or
you wouldn't do differently?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
What have you carried forward?

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.108 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Well, I think
every experience I've ever had

00:26:25.108 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
in my life has--

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Applies to now?

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.506 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON:
--taught me things,

00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:84%
information to
move forward with.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I like to think
I've just matured

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
as a person beyond
who I was when

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I started an organization
20 years ago.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So yes, starting
organizations, like running

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
political campaigns,
it's not an easy thing.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And who you are as a person is
as important as what you do.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a lot
of things I have learned,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.985 align:middle line:84%
but most of them have to
do with my own orientation.

00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:13.263 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.263 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
you want work

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to get done so badly
that you forget

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that the human relationships
within the work are the work.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
talking about now

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is exactly how every
American feels.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
If you fix what's
going on in here,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:90%
then you can fix it out there.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.792 align:middle line:84%
But until you have seen it and
addressed it, it doesn't work.

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Everything
we do is infused with

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
with which we do it.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take care
of our state of being,

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
out of which emerges the
most powerful state of doing.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
undervalued, underestimated,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and under-efforted
in the area of being.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But in our crowd, if
we're not careful,

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to underestimate,
undervalue, and under-effort

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
the area of doing.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is the being and
then the doing and the being

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
and then the doing.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I once saw some graffiti that
said, to do is to be, Hegel.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The other one said, to
be is to do, Sartre.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it said do be,
do be, do, Frank Sinatra.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.655 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I like that, yeah.

00:28:25.655 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Frank Sinatra.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I like that one.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.038 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: So stupid, but
I always get a laugh out of it.

00:28:29.038 --> 00:28:29.976 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:28:29.976 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I actually have the
magnet on my refrigerator.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
incredible energy,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and you seem completely
comfortable with where

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:90%
you're going with this.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else that you want

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to leave us with and tell us
in terms of your campaign?

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: What I want
to leave you with, Lisa,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is how much it matters that
you've had me on your program,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
how much it matters that I
have felt psychologically

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally so
supported by you,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is how things
happen, one person showing up

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.482 align:middle line:84%
at a time, and that you
have made your support--

00:29:07.482 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt from you,
oh, I really support you.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I hope you win.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I have felt, I
really support you.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.403 align:middle line:90%
Come be on my show.

00:29:13.403 --> 00:29:13.986 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.391 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: I really
support you this or that.

00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And you, in that sense,
demonstrate, not only for me

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
but for everyone,
what it looks like.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you very, very much.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
That would be my main message
is of gratitude to you and to so

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
many like you who are
really inspiring me.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I feel such gratitude as
I go through this process.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The quote that you
said about not being afraid

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of the light that you
are shining within,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I see you shining that
light so strongly,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.219 align:middle line:84%
and you don't seem that you're
afraid of your own light.

00:29:50.219 --> 00:29:51.302 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: I think we--

00:29:51.302 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
People talk about how
living in the light is hard.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
No, living outside
the light is hard.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
People talk about how
the light is scary.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, the darkness
is what should scare us.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:10%
Really going for it,
people say, is scary,

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:10%
but I think not going
for it is more scary.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.307 align:middle line:90%
It eats you up inside.

00:30:14.307 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: We all know
too much now that we can live

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
comfortably and peacefully
within ourselves not doing what

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
we can to, in
whatever small way,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.599 align:middle line:84%
create the world that we know
in our hearts is possible.

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You're such an
inspiration to no longer settle

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
for that and no longer be quiet
about that and to really take

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:90%
a stand.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.330 align:middle line:84%
If you can do it,
we can all do it.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much, Marianne.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAMSON: Right
back at you, Lisa.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:90%
