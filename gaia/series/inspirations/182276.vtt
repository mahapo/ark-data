>>LISA GARR: What is my purpose?

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the most asked question
of my radio show callers

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to make
sense of why we are here.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
This question is also what
started best-selling author

of the "Way of the
Peaceful Warrior"

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:10%

Dan Millman, former
world champion gymnast

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:10%

His internationally
best-selling book

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
"Way of the Peaceful Warrior"
was adapted to film in 2006.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.965 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAN MILLMAN: Hi, Lisa.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.573 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So great
to have you here.

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Great to be here.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So tell me.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all, your book.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And I read it.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:10%
And I loved it.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's impacted so
many people's lives.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.223 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you hear this
all the time, right?

00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I hear
it often enough.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.355 align:middle line:90%
It's very gratifying.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you start off--
did just tell us

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about the story.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Were you really looking
for purpose in your life?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MILLMAN: Yes, but in
the same way everybody is.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.288 align:middle line:10%
I think we're
hard-wired goal seekers.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:10%
I watched my grandchildren
when they were little,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:10%
crawling across the floor.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
They wanted something.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So like anybody, I was trying
to find out how I fit here

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and what I could
do with my life.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that started me
contemplating and wondering,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
looking at life
through that lens.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose here?

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that developed into
much of what I've written.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it was preceded,
though, by an accident.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:90%
We have this change in life.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
interrupts our life.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we see it as
a catastrophe at the time.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And you were seeking, right?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, we hear
the word disruption a lot

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
in business, and
politics, and technology.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:10%
And so when I shattered my
right leg in a motorcycle crash

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:10%
at the peak of my career,
I was heading for the--

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:10%
toward the Olympics.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:10%
It did disrupt my life.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I began to ask
bigger questions then.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I became more
interested in, what's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:90%
the bigger picture of life?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I shifted
from being a young athlete

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.145 align:middle line:84%
and coach looking for how we
create more talent for sports

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to, how can we create more
talent or skill sets for life?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:90%
So daily life became the arena.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And that question sent
me around the world,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
working with various
mentors, including

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
the old man I called Socrates.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And it developed
into an approach

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%
to living over several decades.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you ever
told, though, you're never

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
going to walk again or perform
again the way that you were?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got the
naysayers on top of you,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the purpose
with the catastrophic event.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a perfect storm, always.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure, sure.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes the biggest
naysayers are internal.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that the truth?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Nick Nolte
in the movie version

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
said, I call myself
a peaceful warrior,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
because the real battles
are inside of us.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we can overcome our
battles with self-doubt,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
insecurity, fear, and so
on, then the challenges

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
of everyday life become less.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
We're able to
tackle them better.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I mean
by the term warrior.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes, though, those
naysayers are what we focus on,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We focus on that
person saying, well,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
you never perform
the way you used to.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you get that line?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, expectations,
including my own--

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really have any.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I just said let's
see what happens.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But I began doing push-ups
before I left the hospital.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Even with a shattered leg--

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.843 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --they
did a major surgery.

00:03:42.843 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just went to the beach
and started doing strength

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and said let's see what happens.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think this
let's see approach.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Doing my best was really a key.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why I never recommend to
people they strive for success.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.065 align:middle line:90%
That's not in our control.

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can control our
efforts, but not the outcomes.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But by making a good
effort over time,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we increase the odds of
getting the desired result.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:90%
So that was the approach I took.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend
people strive for excellence,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.427 align:middle line:90%
which is what I did.

00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And I kept striving.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And the story is a
comeback story, of course.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was successful
in its way.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You strove for
excellence, but not perfection.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
My husband is a major
athlete, a state champion.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
He just broke his ankle.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's going through
this lack of identity,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
because he was so
identified there.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I
emphasize to people,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.803 align:middle line:84%
don't say I am a
musician, I am an athlete.

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Because that becomes
our identity.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.195 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And if we lose that--
and everyone does eventually--

00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:90%
then we say, who am I?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But if we say, I do music,
I do sports, I do medicine,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:90%
then that's not who we are.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just something we do.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And we do it as best we can, so
people don't have that identity

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:90%
crisis as much.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's definitely--
because an athlete really

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
is all consuming.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
You're physical.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.635 align:middle line:90%
It's mentally straining.

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Emotional.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Emotional.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And you have goals.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And it really is an
all-involving thing.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And it also lifted him so much.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So to be grounded is
tough, and I understand.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So at this point in your
life, what do you do?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:90%
What is your purpose now?

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, my purpose
now is sharing with you

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying our
conversation, which I am.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to focus more on
the purpose in the moment.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, if someone says,
what's your cosmic purpose?

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
That's sometimes
tough to get your--

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.593 align:middle line:90%
a grip on.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But if someone says,
what is your purpose now?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people know what their
purpose is in that moment.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
This moment.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: In my little book,
"The Four Purposes of Life,"

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that's the fourth purpose.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And it may be the most
important for all of us.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose here and now?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And that we can--
we usually know.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And we can focus on that.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And it creates more
quality moments.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of our
moments, of course,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.835 align:middle line:90%
become the quality of our life.

00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, this book, "Way
of the Peaceful Warrior"

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:90%
started this.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever plan it being
an international success

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:90%
when you wrote it?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, my life
is much more closely

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.485 align:middle line:84%
resembling improvisational
comedy to strategic planning.

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A combination of both?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I just
shared something

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.405 align:middle line:84%
that was meaningful to me, based
on my previous life experience.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe a few
college students would like it.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I really couldn't have
predicted the impact

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
it had over the decades,
really, and continues to have.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I say that without hubris.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It just still
surprises me, but there

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
must have been something
that caught lightning.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really was one
of the first books that

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
described the hero's journey
in a metaphorical way.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It happened to have been the
autobiography of your life,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.853 align:middle line:84%
but done in such
a wonderful way.

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
heard from people

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
over the years, why it made
such a big impact 25 years ago?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I asked people, because
they would repeat

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.907 align:middle line:84%
the same thing over
and over-- this book

00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
changed my life in some way.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to say, why?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it did was
it helped expand perspectives

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
about our promise
and possibilities.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it offered reminders
that people tend to know

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
deep down, but we forget.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I do today.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I offer reminders and
perspectives with people.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you speak to
corporations and everyone.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And this theme is
around purpose?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.105 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
speak about now?

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:30.262 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, that's one of
the major themes in my work.

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
People say, what do you
mean, peaceful warrior?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's really about all of us.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
This is not so much
about me as us.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.733 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's about living
with a peaceful heart.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
We're all striving to do that.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
recognizing the times

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
we need a warrior spirit to
really face what we need to

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:90%
in the arena of daily life.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what
I wanted to share.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's an approach to living.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It includes life skills
like learning to live

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment and why.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, living
a purposeful life.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And several of my books deal
with that central question of,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%
what are we here to do?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:90%
And what are we doing here?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, that's one
of the biggest questions

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:90%
from callers.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get
to that answer?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:90%
What is purpose?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well,
that was something

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that was unfocused in my life.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And I met various mentors.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't write another book
after "Way of the Peaceful

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Warrior" for 10 years.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt I'd said
what I had to say.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Then other mentors
entered my life.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was so excited--

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
this radically new
cutting-edge information.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So that stimulated "Sacred
Journey of the Peaceful

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Warrior," the second book I
wrote 10 years later, and then

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
"No Ordinary Moments," and
a number of other books--

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
17 that eventually followed.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I've never written a book just
to have another book out there.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It has to justify itself.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: So there are
many facets of this way.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:90%
One of my mentors--

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I call him the warrior priest--

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
had an uncannily accurate system
for deriving one's life path--

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
clarifying, crystallizing,
illuminating the core

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
issues of our life, and some
hurdles we're here to overcome,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:90%
and the strengths we have.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And he gave a series of
lectures, and I attended.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I began to teach
friends, relatives anything,

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:84%
doing readings for them,
kind of consultations.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And over the years, I finally--

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
after eight years,
I decided it was

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
time to write a book
with the material.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:10%
And that became a
book called "The Life

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.682 align:middle line:10%
You Were Born to Live."

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Which is really cool.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:10%
So that gets you
to life purpose--

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --through a
series of calculations

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
using your birth
date and so forth.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole
Life Purpose Calculator

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.103 align:middle line:10%
on your website, which I love.

00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:10%
It's the Way of the Peaceful
Warrior website, right?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.672 align:middle line:10%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you can
calculate your life purpose.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And has it really proved to
be accurate for people that

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.958 align:middle line:90%
go on there and check it out?

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, of
course, no author

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
is going to say, no, not really.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, it has some
uncanny accuracy.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand it, how
deriving from your birth date--

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, astrologers do things
with that, and the time

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:90%
of your birth, and so on.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
This is very accessible.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I've studied all the systems of
self-analysis, self-knowledge.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
The Oracle at Delphi--

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
over the gates, they
had "Know thyself."

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It's ancient wisdom.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And every religious
and spiritual tradition

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%
says know yourself.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't
know ourself--

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking at a kind
of illusion we've developed,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
then we make the right
decisions for the wrong person,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
the one we thought we were.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So "The Life You
Were Born to Live"

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
is to help people really
know themselves to the bone

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and make wiser decisions
for who they truly

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:84%
are and have more
compassion for themselves

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and others in their lives.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you can also look
up loved ones, friends,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and understand the path they're
taking up that mountain.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So would you consider
yourself an introvert?

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I'd have
to say it varies.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
There are times I go into very
introverted, introspective

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:90%
times, working on new books.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And I need time to
recharge on my own.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But other times, I'm very
gregarious and outgoing,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.072 align:middle line:84%
so I think there's
a mixture there.

00:11:20.072 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take
this personality type

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that you just explained about
yourself and the introvert

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and at times being gregarious.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And you fit that into,
how do I show up?

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
How do I show up in life?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
What do I do with
these personalities?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
How do I achieve
anything in my life?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.187 align:middle line:84%
It becomes confusing,
doesn't it?

00:11:39.187 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, it certainly
can, especially when

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:90%
we project into the future.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But if we say, how do I
show up right now and strive

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to be as authentic as we can?

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Like what you see
is what you get.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not different
with other people

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:90%
or in other circumstances.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So I have developed
a sense of who I am.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Authenticity has always
been very important to me.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, you can tell.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And the way that you write--

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.032 align:middle line:84%
I love that you say
you write a book,

00:12:04.032 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's got to have
a meaning in your life.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come
from an experience.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you take your time
to do something like that.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And it really gets
to the next place.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So at what point did "Way
of the Peaceful Warrior"

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
get adapted to a film?

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well,
first I got called

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
from Robert Downey, Jr. He
said, you want to have dinner?

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm in San Francisco,
and we're making a film.

00:12:26.605 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
He was just starting
out in his career.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'd like to play
your role in the movie.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And I flew to Columbia.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, there's a
longer story I won't go into,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
but I said no.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds a little
crazy right now in retrospect.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Then somebody-- another
company offered to do the film.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said I declined.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
really good-hearted guy

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
who was an aspiring producer who
said, I'd like to do your film.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And for various
reasons, I said yes.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And it only took him 18 years
to finally have a company.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Sobini Films produced the film.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was distributed by
Lionsgate, then Universal.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It took-- from the time the
book was first published,

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
well over 20 years
to create the film.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it important
for you to create it?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Or you wanted it done right?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, I don't
know what done right is.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
A movie is a meal for
consciousness in two hours.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So movies can rarely
capture what's

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
in the book of the internal
life of the character

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and yet, I was honored that they
were willing to spend the money

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:90%
to adapt my work to film.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.337 align:middle line:90%
And it was an exciting time.

00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you a part of the
process in choosing Nick Nolte?

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: No, no.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I sold the rights.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was a
cheerleader-- that's it--

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to the project,
wishing them well

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and letting the
professionals do their thing.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I did contribute some
scenes at the last minute--

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
a couple of lines
in some scenes.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't the screenwriter.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I was just supportive
of the project.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it reaches a
new and different audience.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:90%
It's become sort of a cult film.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's great.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And many
people then read the book,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:90%
which is all to the good.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually take
a look of the trailer

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
of the movie, the way of
the "Peaceful Warrior."

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I call myself a
peaceful warrior,

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:84%
because the battles we
fight are on the inside.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.325 align:middle line:84%
This moment is the only
thing that matters.

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:29.968 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:30.768 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Socrates.

00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Socrates.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:90%
How did you find the Socrates?

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.673 align:middle line:84%
Did you just have to
be a seeker, really?

00:14:38.673 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: There's a saying.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Many people have heard that
when the student is ready,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:90%
the teacher appears.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And many people
imagine that to mean

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
when I'm deserving enough
or prepared enough,

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
a teacher will appear
like Socrates in my life

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and guide me up the path.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But I believe what it
means-- when the student is

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
ready or actually
paying attention,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
the teacher appears everywhere.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So Socrates-- for me,
I was coming off--

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I read the Carlos
Castaneda books.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to show that you
could find a teacher anywhere.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered
a cosmic fellow I

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
had met who wouldn't
tell me his real name,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
but he reminded me
of the Greek sage,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
so I started calling
him Socrates.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And he represented the
archetypal teacher.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Frodo had Gandalf in
"Lord of the Rings,"

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and Arthur had Merlin.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Danielson had Mr. Miyagi
in the "Karate Kid."

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So this archetypal
student-teacher relationship

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:90%
is one way to convey ideas.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was all intuitive.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I think
I'll share these lessons

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I learned over the years.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I wrote the book 14
years after I met Socrates.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: So it was
all my life experience.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my own higher self
as well contributed somehow

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
to what went down in the book.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you always
wanted to be an author?

00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Oh, not at all.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not at all, huh?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.167 align:middle line:84%
A 10-page paper in
college was intimidating.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Like most of us, how am I
going to write 10 pages?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: But it happened
over a process with time.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.662 align:middle line:90%
I've always seen myself--

00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I love to teach, so I taught
gymnastics-- what I knew.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But later it segued over
to something bigger.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
When my interests
expanded into daily life,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I started looking for things
that could really help people.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You expanded,
too, and as a coach,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
which we talked a little bit
about this on my radio show,

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that a coach really
is an earned title.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.288 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Randomly, people
call themselves coaches.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they have a lot of
influence over young people.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And that comes with a certain
amount of credibility,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and honor, and authenticity.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Somebody really
needs to understand

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:90%
what that word means.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
What does being a
coach mean to you?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: The word
supportive comes to me.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
A coach is there to support
you and your process.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the central tenets of
"The Peaceful Warrior's Way"

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no best book,
teacher, religion, path, diet,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
exercise system.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
There's only the
best for each of us

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:90%
at a given time of our lives.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:90%
Life is an experiment.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.945 align:middle line:84%
So I have a profound respect
for each person's process.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
So as a coach, I
look to that person.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:90%
I'm there to support them.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I often remind people.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here for
people to trust me.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help people
trust themselves.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, that's
what a coach is.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I began coaching
in gymnastics.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
A coach has to address
someone's mind, emotions, body,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
whereas maybe a teacher in
college-- it's more academic.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%
They just do the lectures.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And the student goes and
reads the books and studies.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have a much more
intimate and deep connection

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I think a good psychotherapist
is a coach as well.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's more than
a word or title

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
someone uses like, I'm a life
coach, which is terrific.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.893 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have a
lot of people around.

00:17:49.893 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And we can coach each other.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --we're all
students and teachers.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Friends and so forth.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said to me once
that life is about the journey,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.238 align:middle line:84%
but it's also about
the destination.

00:18:00.238 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, in the
"Peaceful Warrior" movie,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
the character Dan
has a revelation,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that it's the journey
that makes us happy,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
not just reaching the
destination, which

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:90%
is a wise idea.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But without a destination in
mind, there is no journey.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:90%
We just wander around.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So from our point A, we
need to pick a point B,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's for the day,
for the minute, for the hour,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
something we're moving toward.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
To me, success is
making progress

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.320 align:middle line:84%
toward a goal that's
meaningful to us.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
That's really a meaningful
way to define success.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.977 align:middle line:90%
And if the goal changes--

00:18:38.977 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: We move in
a different direction.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we enjoy
the journey and the way.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The path.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.008 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Most of
it's the journey.

00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right-- which is always
filled with bumps, and rocks,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.835 align:middle line:90%
and routes, and obstacles.

00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes, spiritual--

>>LISA: Training points.

>>MILLMAN: --weightlifting.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Many times we volunteer
for adversity,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:90%
because we intuit the value.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I ask audiences.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.053 align:middle line:84%
Please raise your hand
if you've experienced

00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
physical, emotional, or
mental pain in your life.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Everybody raises their hand.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, because of that
pain, that challenge,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.845 align:middle line:84%
that difficulty, we're
a little bit stronger,

00:19:09.845 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
a little bit wiser, and maybe
even have a bigger perspective

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%
about life.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
pretend to like adversity.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But when a challenge happens,
we roll up our sleeves.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And we know we're going
to get stronger and wiser

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:90%
from doing it.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If we could
just remember that--

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:90%

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:90%

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
not the victim, but why
is it happening to me?

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:90%
But, all right.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Time to roll up my sleeves.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I've done it before.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I can do it again.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:90%

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.178 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The book,
"The Four Purposes--"

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned the fourth.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
What are the first three?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, the first
purpose is something we all

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:90%
share--

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.037 align:middle line:90%
learning life's lessons.

00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we just
talked about that.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And many people go,
well, I know that.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.997 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we learn
from our experience.

00:19:52.997 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's more about the idea
that Earth is a divine school.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And daily life is our classroom.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Daily life is
guaranteed to teach us

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
everything we need
to learn in order

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:90%
to evolve as human beings--

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.198 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Guaranteed, isn't it?

00:20:06.198 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --to really
appreciate the challenges.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
A man wrote to me once and
said, Dan, I read your book.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want to do
more spiritual practice,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.193 align:middle line:90%
but I'm married.

00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I have three children.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm married, full-time job.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
He came to understand
his work, his family

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:90%
were his spiritual practices.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And they develop us.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
They demand more and develop
us more than sitting in a cave

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:90%
and meditating.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.085 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I know

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's
a great point where

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
you get-- leave work and then
you go do your yoga class

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or you do your
spiritual practice.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you can bring
those principles of balance--

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah, everything.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --into work and of being
the observer into situations?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
All those great
spiritual practices

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
in real daily life, I
think, is the real school--

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It is.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:90%
That's from my view.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --into the life school.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And then the second purpose?

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: The second
purpose is what we normally

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:90%
think of our purpose.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
What is my career?

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%
What is my calling?

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're the same
thing in your case, in mine.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But for many people,
they have a career.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's appropriate.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
The primary purpose of a
career is to make an income.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:90%
We may like our career.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.002 align:middle line:84%
We may have people we
like, we work with.

00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we weren't
making any money,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we'd have to find
something else.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: It's to support
ourselves and our family,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
whereas a calling is
something we would do,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:90%
even if we weren't paid for it.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in our discretionary time.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Could be a hobby or
something we're moved to do.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they become
the same, and they meld.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Other times they're separate.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's the second purpose
is getting more clarity.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And in several of my books,
I give specific methods

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to become more clear on what's
the most appropriate work.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we can make
good money doing what

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
we enjoy or find suitable
while serving other people.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you hear
that a lot, though,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is that this is my
spiritual practice,

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to make
more money from it.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Right.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And if we can, that's great.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But some people-- it's playing
guitar or doing a sport.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or singing.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Or singing, or
dancing, or art, or writing.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But if we love doing
it, keep doing it.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And one day, perhaps an
income may be generated.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:90%
But meanwhile, my agents--

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
when I sold my first
book, I remember.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I never forgot what they said.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't quit your day job yet.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So we need a day job as well,
so we're not a starving artist.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you sell the
first book to a publisher?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.595 align:middle line:90%
Or did you self-publish it?

00:22:27.595 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I sold
to a publisher.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did?

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I didn't
know what an agent was.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They said, you need to
send this to an agent,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:90%
so I found somebody.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.412 align:middle line:84%
And they were
willing to read it.

00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And they took a chance on it.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And it sold and sold modestly.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And I went from there.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But word of mouth is a
wonderful, magical thing

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
when it happens.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When it's a good book.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, do we get to the third?

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I found this
article in HuffPost.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the top 10
things people want in life,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:90%
but can't find.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And the top five things
had to do with purpose.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's always
been an issue.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It's such an odd term--

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.233 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it really, I
think, is up to the individual.

00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:09.312 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It is.

00:23:09.312 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what is the third?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well,
there are thousands

00:23:13.378 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of purposes that appear
to different people

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But just as we divide
the days of the year

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
into four seasons and
the points on a compass

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:84%
into four primary directions,
by looking at our life

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
through learning life's lessons,
through career and calling.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the third purpose is
finding our life path.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It's like a hidden calling.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Most people are not clear.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
They're stumbling in the dark,
wondering why they're not

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:90%
feeling on track entirely.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what an unusual
mentor I called the warrior

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
priest who taught me this system
for helping clarify one's life

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's another kind of purpose.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
feature in "The Life

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:90%
You Were Born to Live."

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a bigger
overarching theme in your life?

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It is.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a bigger theme.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It's what we learn
through relationships,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and through our work,
and through daily life.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:90%
We start to clarify.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Am I here to express myself?

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Am I here to use
my creative energy?

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Am I here to learn
to trust myself?

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Different people have more acute
points in these various areas.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are 45
different life paths--

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.765 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --for people born
since 1750 to the present day.

00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And so the book covers them all.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
about after 2000s?

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, there are some
individuals born after 2000

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
who have a single-digit
birth number.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I explained in the new
edition of the book, which

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
came out recently,
why that's important,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.515 align:middle line:84%
and what master numbers
really mean, and so on.

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, people say,
but explain it to me.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Scientifically, I can't.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
But I do know it's accurate.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Accurate.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And
it's a useful tool

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.525 align:middle line:90%
for understanding ourselves.

00:24:55.525 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It always is.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a personality
test, essentially,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:84%
is when you look at
mine, is the life path 8.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.763 align:middle line:90%
And in various systems--

00:25:03.763 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
you could look at it
in various systems.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:90%
It all says the same thing.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It talks about having--
being goal oriented,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and having a mission in
life, and really moving

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:90%
towards that mission.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look at my
birth sign, Capricorn,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:84%
it's climbing the mountain
to get to the mission,

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that it's interesting.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So it does give you
a way of defining

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:90%
your path a little bit more.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a guide.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I'd like to think
of it as a foundation for life.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
that, anything you--

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it's dealing
with finances,

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:90%
health, relationships.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's all covered in
the book-- those aspects.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
You start to
understand how better

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to approach those things.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reading-- this
warrior priest did for me when

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I was first exposed to this.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you a psychic?

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, but I've been
trained to know where to look.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
share with people.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Many people say, Dan, I wish
I had a mentor like Socrates.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And I go, you do.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:90%
That's why I wrote the book.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And we all find who we need
at the time we need it.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can also look up other
people's life path numbers

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and see how you relate to
them-- family members, friends.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: There's
even an app for--

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, cool.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.965 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --iPhones
or Android phones.

00:26:12.965 --> 00:26:16.033 align:middle line:84%
And it has much of the
material in the book as an app.

00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's on your phone.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It's handy all the time.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.117 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's really great.

00:26:19.117 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, it's free, too.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.907 align:middle line:90%
You could look up at--

00:26:21.907 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
If you go to
peacefulwarrior.com,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:90%
that's the easiest thing.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll see Life
Purpose Calculator.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Click on that.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Put in your date of birth.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's right there--
some information--

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.335 align:middle line:84%
your birth number and some
keywords in your life.

00:26:35.335 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
much more in the book.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you
a flavor, a taste.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did yours say gymnast?

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.817 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: No, nothing
that's specific.

00:26:42.817 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you take
the Olympic team,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
they're all different
life patterns.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: But they
approach it differently.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
They each have their own
weaknesses and strengths.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had known this system
when I was a coach at Stanford.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, what about
being a gymnast

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.691 align:middle line:84%
and knowing this about
yourself and an athlete?

00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Athletes learn
universal or spiritual laws

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:90%
through their training.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.808 align:middle line:84%
It becomes embodied in
their cells in their body.

00:27:07.808 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know it, because
they're so focused on scores,

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.875 align:middle line:90%
and winning, and losing.

00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And they miss the bigger
picture of what they're actually

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:90%
gaining.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah, athletes
learn a lot, as you know.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.922 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I used to be
a competitive cyclist.

00:27:19.922 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I enjoy so much
more, just riding,

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying nature, and what
it shows you and my thought

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going
for any type of time.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm going for the experience
and also, the community, too.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really cool when you get
with a group of people that

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.975 align:middle line:90%
are all doing the same thing--

00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:41.775 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:27:41.775 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:84%

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:90%

great conversations.

And it's a community
builder There's so much more

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:90%
than comes with just the score.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It really is.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And that's true
for musicians or anybody

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:90%
who practices anything.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They can learn about

here at you actually doing some

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:90%
of this work on the trampoline.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:10%

>> Although I enjoy
many forms of exercise,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:10%
the Peaceful Warrior Workout
has been the core of my daily

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:10%
routine for the last decade.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm a grandfather now,
almost 50 years old.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:10%
But this routine has helped
me look and feel younger

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:10%
than my chronological age.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
toward greater energy
and well-being,

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
now by investing four
minutes a day in yourself.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's it.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Four minutes a day in yourself.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you do when you
invest four minutes a day

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.940 align:middle line:90%
in yourself?

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Well--

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Four minutes?

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.373 align:middle line:10%
>>MILLMAN: --I recognize--

00:28:42.373 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:10%
I try to be realistic
and practical,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.440 align:middle line:10%
rather than just conceptual.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to develop
a workout that's

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:10%
almost excuse proof you can do.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:52.408 align:middle line:90%
And this was developed.

00:28:52.408 --> 00:28:53.895 align:middle line:90%
That was 23 years ago.

00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can do a
workout in four minutes?

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Four minutes.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It's designed and complete in
less than four minutes a day.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.567 align:middle line:84%
And it gets every
part of the body.

00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:90%
It's deep breathing.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the key to it, but also
moving every part of the body.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing this
every day for the last--

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.235 align:middle line:84%
I guess about 30
years every day.

00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the core of what I do.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.818 align:middle line:84%
And I do more than
that, but that's

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:17.022 align:middle line:84%
what I do every day on
the road anywhere I go.

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on the idea
that a little of something

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:90%
is better than a lot of nothing.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.245 align:middle line:84%

>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Be happy to.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Should I stand up
here and do it?

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Awesome.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.333 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we can
do the standing part.

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it sitting?

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Probably not.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's designed-- I mean,
there are some movements

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:90%
you could do.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But the first one is
the stretch back--

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:84%
a profound, deep
stretch back and then a

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
swing down, where you actually
are standing up with your legs

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:90%
straight.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And you do a momentary stretch.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
This one is a
squat-down side stretch

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
where you fill the lungs
up and stretch sideways.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Then we work down the body with
a neck release and shoulder

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:90%
rolls to open up tension here.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And then a spine swing for the
lower spine abdominals and then

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
something called Elvis Pelvis
for the deep pelvic muscles.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And then one called
Heaven and Earth

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:84%
where you stretch up and
down, balancing on one leg

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:90%
momentarily.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That gives you an idea about it.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's others more
for cardiovascular.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.292 align:middle line:84%
But it's a workout
anyone can do.

00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like a suit of clothing.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.782 align:middle line:90%
You tailor it for yourself.

00:30:26.782 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And where
do you find that?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Where's the workout?

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.403 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: People can go to
peacefulwarrior.com and look

00:30:31.403 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
for my online courses,
and it's all there.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so cool.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: And it can be done.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not an expensive course.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's accessible to
anyone, pretty much.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
when anyone asks me,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
what is your secret
or your trick

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to living a fulfilled life?

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's always movement.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Movement does so much for
the body, and the brain--

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and possibilities.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
the means to move,

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
like maybe you have an
injury, you can do a lot of it

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:90%
from a chair--

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --as long as you
get the blood circulating.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge piece.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: It's a
little bit of something,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's important
for anybody.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.347 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that people
dream big, but start small

00:31:16.347 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and then connect the dots.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And start somewhere.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it can be overwhelming
to get into an exercise

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:90%
routine.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you've got
to start somewhere.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Starting small.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's a great picture
here of you on a unicycle.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.587 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love this picture.

00:31:31.587 --> 00:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And you do a lot of
different things.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:84%
What is that like
to ride a unicycle?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: For my
60th birthday, I

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.912 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do something special.

00:31:38.912 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:90%
That was what?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
13 years ago.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.517 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And so I decided
to learn to ride a unicycle.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.142 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine loaned me his.

00:31:45.142 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I went to a tennis court.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And long story short,
it took me three weeks,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:90%
a very discouraging practice.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:84%
If anybody has tried to ride
one, it feels impossible.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a klutz.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:84%
After one week, a
little bit of progress.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks-- a little bit more.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:90%
But then it clicked.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And by the third week, I
was doing figure eights

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
around the courts.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I mention
this is because I

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:90%
learned two things from that.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:84%
One is everything is difficult
until it becomes easy.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.625 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: So people hit
something, and it's difficult.

00:32:17.625 --> 00:32:19.083 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh,
this isn't for me.

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:90%
But just persist through it.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I came back every day
and kept doing it.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And then something happened.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%
But the second thing--

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:84%
there are days in
a relationship,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:84%
learning to ride a unicycle, in
other fields of endeavor where

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
everything seems to fall
apart, where you're worse

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.100 align:middle line:90%
than you were days before.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.275 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: But
those are the days

00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
where it's going from the
front brain to the back brain.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Those are the days where
it's becoming automatic.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.655 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- the whole body is
confused-- the mind, the body.

00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But usually, that's when
the learning is happening.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's often a
breakthrough the next day.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So in a relationship crisis,
if you persist through it,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
you can often break through
to new levels of intimacy

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.145 align:middle line:84%
the same way you can
learning to ride a unicycle.

00:33:04.145 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So stick with something.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even try
something that you

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know you're going to be
good at, like maybe juggling.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Sure.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And just stick
with it as a hobby

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
until you can
actually master it.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: We're not supposed--

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.317 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not master it.

00:33:15.317 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --to be
confident at the start.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be confident.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Competence breeds confidence.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we keep
practicing anything,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:90%
you develop a certain expertise.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret
if there is one,

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:90%
is keep doing it over time.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
We get better.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to
feel the confidence.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And doesn't
the brain love newness?

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Creates all that dopamine?

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It does.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Loves new things.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: And every day is new.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I taught a thousand seat
drops on the trampoline--

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:90%
just seat drops.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But I never taught the
same one, because each one

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is a different person,
different circumstance.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We think-- most people--
maybe they're bored,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
or they're
traumatized, or bored.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:90%
They try something.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Then they do it right once,
and they go, OK, now I'm bored.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But we never do the
same thing twice.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It's always-- I'm still refining
the Peaceable Warrior Workout.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.040 align:middle line:84%
After 30 years, I'm getting
a little bit better.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Small points.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So I once asked Socrates what
his secret of living was.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Dan, you
practice gymnastics.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:90%
I practice everything.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of practicing
everything we do-- breathing,

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:90%
walking, standing--

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:84%
brings us into that
flow, that absorption.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:90%
We're not just doing the dishes.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.165 align:middle line:90%
We're practicing the dishes.

00:34:26.165 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
doing the laundry.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:84%
We're folding it more
neatly than we did.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:90%
We're practicing our signature.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, it
brings us into this--

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
really this state of absorption
in the present moment.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:90%
It becomes very zen-like.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just going to say
it's just like a zen master.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:43.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how
you live your life?

00:34:43.765 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, that's
what I strive to do--

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, of course.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: --like anybody.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:90%
I have moments.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Life is a series of moments.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.406 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, that-- someone
once said, have you

00:34:52.406 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
mastered everything you
write about in your books?

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no, I haven't.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.015 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sincerely practicing.

00:34:58.015 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's the
book, "The Hidden School--"

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.383 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --basically
talking about life

00:35:02.383 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:90%
is your hidden school, right?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Right--
for all of us.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little
bit more about that book.

00:35:09.385 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, in that
book, I build the foundation

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:90%
beneath the foundation.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an
advanced teaching.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But I took great care
in writing it clearly.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:84%
André Gide once said, everything
that needs to be said has

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.467 align:middle line:90%
already been said.

00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But it needs to be said again,
because no one was really

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:90%
paying attention.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or in a different way.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: In a different way.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, I
help people reconcile

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
truths that happen at
the conventional level

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:90%
like we're separate selves.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:84%
At the conventional level
of life, if I stub my toe,

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.547 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't hurt you, unless
you're highly empathic.

00:35:42.547 --> 00:35:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're separate at
the conventional level.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the transcendental
level, that thing

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
we strive for through religion
and spiritual practice--

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:90%
we are all one.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And it helps reconcile
these apparent paradoxes

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:90%
that sound opposite.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Death is real, yet
death is an illusion.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Time is real and yet,
there is no time.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
We always live in the eternal
present, the eternal present,

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:90%
the eternal present.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.730 align:middle line:90%
So how can those both be true?

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, they are.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on what
level we're coming from--

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.480 align:middle line:90%
the conventional--

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.030 align:middle line:84%
living our daily
life or those moments

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
we can step to the mountain top
and look from the big picture.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And we see a different
level of truth, which

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:90%
brings great peace and relief.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long after
"Peaceful Warrior"

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:90%
did you write "Hidden School?"

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: About 37 years.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I wasn't ready
to write it until recently.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you really wanted
to bring in the depth of what

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:90%
you'd learned.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Right.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an
adventure story.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But through-- near
the end of the story,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.463 align:middle line:84%
that's when these
revelations come.

00:36:43.463 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look here
at the video of "The Hidden

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.680 align:middle line:90%
School."

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: On the subway
and here in New York City,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I did a 4-Minute Meditation,
which I do introduce

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:90%
in "The Hidden School."

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me
what's important in life

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and helps me to appreciate
each day and each moment.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:15.820 align:middle line:84%
We can get taken in and absorbed
by the duties of daily life.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while, it's
good to step back as if

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
going from down in the
weeds, up to a mountain top.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Because everything looks
better in a panorama

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.950 align:middle line:90%
from the distance.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So these explorations remind
us of life's bigger picture,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
what we're really doing
here and here to do.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a term in
Japan called satori

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
when the mind, and the goals,
and the body, and the emotions

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.835 align:middle line:90%
are all aligned.

00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:43.268 align:middle line:90%
And there's a power in that.

00:37:43.268 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Because often, we do one
thing and think another.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.727 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have
heard that saying.

00:37:46.727 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
When the student is ready,
the teacher appears.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
However, many
misunderstand that saying.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:84%
What it actually means
is when the student is

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
ready or really
paying attention,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.290 align:middle line:90%
the teacher appears everywhere.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I learned a profound
lesson one day,

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:90%
watching a cloud ride the wind.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And I had so much to do.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.850 align:middle line:90%
My breath was shallow.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I felt pressured.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to
look out the window.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a cloud not
trying to race the wind,

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
but just floating along
with the pace of the wind.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I
took a deep breath.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I calmed down.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything I
needed to do that afternoon,

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
but quiet in a natural
pace like that cloud.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:10%
That question of why people
may benefit from a deeper

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:10%
philosophical or spiritual
exploration is a profound one

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:10%
and I think important
for all of us

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.829 align:middle line:10%
to consider, at least
in moments of our lives.

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I learn so
much from clouds.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.513 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:38:47.513 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And trees
bending in the wind

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and streams flowing downhill.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolute.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I just did a video
of that this morning.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Did you?

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:84%
If we could just
be like the stream

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and go over the rocks, and
downstream, and flow like it

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It never thinks about,
oh, there's a rock.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't flow.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
stream is still going.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend that
we go on a pilgrimage

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or vacate our lives in order to
really, truly find ourselves?

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I think one of the
deeper truths that I found,

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, is that we're
all on a pilgrimage.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's conscious
or not, we're

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.290 align:middle line:84%
all on a spiritual quest in
this school of daily life.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be elsewhere.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So we don't?

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: No.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
like retreats.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.680 align:middle line:84%
That can be appropriate
or to take--

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But then--

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:39.465 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: --some time.

00:39:39.465 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --you slam
back into your life.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.178 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Back
into everyday life.

00:39:42.178 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:90%
This is where we live.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the arena of
the peaceful warrior lies.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the hidden school.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.775 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: And
the hidden school.

00:39:49.775 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's waiting--

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The hidden school is--

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: --for us.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --right here.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.955 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Right
here, right now.

00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
it's an adventure.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.395 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:58.883 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, many people
undersell their own life.

00:39:58.883 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, Dan wrote
a book about his life.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:90%
What about mine?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But I emphasized always
that each of our stories

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:90%
is our treasure.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Because there's not a
single story on the planet

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
exactly like yours, or mine,
or any of your viewers.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:90%
We're all unique.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
value those stories.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all shown heroism
and courage in those stories.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:90%
We've all overcome adversity.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say
it's an adventure.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
some movie we're watching.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's happening to us right
now, but we sometimes

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:90%
fail to appreciate it.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you know-- what
is your life purpose number?

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It's a 268.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And what did that show
you about yourself?

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, the 2
really is about wanting

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:90%
to help and support people.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.877 align:middle line:90%
It's a need to help people--

00:40:50.877 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And natural coach.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --so wanting
to teach or coach.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:84%
One day I realized
that no matter how much

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I improved myself, only
one person benefited.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But if I could somehow
reach out to other people--

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:84%
so it went from gymnastics
into the arena of daily life,

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.340 align:middle line:90%
as I said.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.110 align:middle line:90%
And the six high standards.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
We can sometimes
beat ourselves up,

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
because we never achieved
what we thought or envisioned.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
That castle in our mind
becomes a garden shed,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and we have to do renovations.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
perfectionist part.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the 6, really, but
the vision of what's possible.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And the 8-- as you
indicated, it's

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:84%
a drive to influence
people, to make

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.200 align:middle line:84%
a difference, and a drive for
recognition in some sense, too.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:90%
To learn our own power.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:44.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one, too, to really
own that in a quiet, real way.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So there are various
nuances of each number.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think Pythagoras was
the first to really ask,

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:90%
do numbers have meaning?

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
What are the
archetypes of numbers?

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.773 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's cool.

00:41:55.773 --> 00:41:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --that's probably
the source of this--

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
ultimately of what I teach
in these various books

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and in some of my--

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: --workshops.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Numbers are--
they do have archetypes.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a really great
way of looking at it.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Life is vibration.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But are there
shadow sides to that?

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's the perfectionism,
which can have a shadow side.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But what's the antidote
to perfectionism?

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: One of the most
important parts of the book

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:84%
are spiritual or universal
laws that I put in the book

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:90%
to help overcome the hurdles.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Because every life
path has hurdles in it

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.280 align:middle line:90%
as well as strengths.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have a
section-- one paragraph

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:84%
on what each life
path looks like when

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.037 align:middle line:84%
it's being worked
in the positive

00:42:33.037 --> 00:42:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and what it looks like
when it's being worked more

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:90%
in the negative.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.463 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: That's why two
people on the same life path--

00:42:38.463 --> 00:42:39.970 align:middle line:84%
their lives may
look very different.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Because one's-- it's
in a more mature,

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
developed way and
the other less so.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So these laws-- the law of
honesty, the law of process,

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.777 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:42:51.777 --> 00:42:53.110 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds very general.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But when people look in
the book or on the app,

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
they can see specifically
how it relates

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.985 align:middle line:84%
to their life and the issues
they're going through.

00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you say that
this is something that's

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.540 align:middle line:84%
a tool that people
really could use

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to further their path in
life or their relationships

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
with other people?

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.317 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Absolutely.

00:43:10.317 --> 00:43:12.708 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if somebody goes
to peacefulwarrior,com,

00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they don't just put in
their date of birth.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:84%
They can put in a
second date of birth

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and a significant other,
a spouse, a friend.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And they see the
dynamic between them.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It's all for free.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.140 align:middle line:90%
It's right there at the website.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.745 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you develop that?

00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:90%
That is cool.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well,
that was part of what

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I learned from this mentor, and
I developed it over the years.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.650 align:middle line:90%
I only had 20 pages of notes.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And it developed into
a fairly big book.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:84%
After years of
working with people,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and doing readings, and
working with the system,

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:90%
new insights came.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think that's
a great story, also,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.390 align:middle line:90%
of recreating yourself.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:90%
You really did.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You took something that
meant so much to you

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and made such an impact.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But 25 years later,
what do I do with this?

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.562 align:middle line:90%
And where does it take me?

00:43:56.562 --> 00:43:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've
been asked questions.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, why did you turn
into numerology after this?

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Right.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like it was a
risky book to write.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Because I can't--

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any solid
scientific foundation.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.568 align:middle line:90%
So here's evidence based.

00:44:08.568 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
We can tell you the
studies that were done.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're not
a numerologist.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: No, I'm not.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I was never very
interested in numerology.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of the books I looked
at seemed vague and abstract.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 40% accurate.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.093 align:middle line:84%
But this book hits
people over the head in--

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:23.893 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:23.893 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --the work
I did, putting into it.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.878 align:middle line:84%
Jack London said it takes hard
writing to make easy reading.

00:44:28.878 --> 00:44:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you have
to put a lot into it.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I put
it in the writing.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what's
the theme here?

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
With all of your work
and with this show

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:90%
is about that word purpose.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Right.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's such a thing.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: People who--
functioning well in life

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't sound too
sexy or spiritual.

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But those who do
get things done tend

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.805 align:middle line:84%
to be-- have a baseline
of more satisfaction

00:44:51.805 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment in
life than people

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:90%
who don't get things done.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:57.250 align:middle line:90%
So part of my work is practical.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:84%
It helps people to take
action in their life.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.370 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing,
rather than necessarily

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to fix our
insides, so we can

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
have just the right,
positive thoughts

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and feel just the right
emotions, rather than that--

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:84%
for example, I say
to people, I don't

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:84%
recommend that you feel
grateful, or happy,

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.400 align:middle line:90%
or peaceful, or kind, or loving.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you
bring that into life.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Behave that way.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Behave with gratitude.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Say thank you to people.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't just feel it.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: It's because we
have less control over what

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.478 align:middle line:90%
feelings come to pass.

00:45:29.478 --> 00:45:32.020 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have received a
gift and we didn't necessarily

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:90%
feel grateful?

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.360 align:middle line:90%
So we--

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.792 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --have less
control over what feelings

00:45:36.792 --> 00:45:40.600 align:middle line:84%
pass through us like the weather
than we do-- what we actually

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:90%
do moment to moment.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So this way of action is
another fundamental element

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.600 align:middle line:90%
of this approach to living.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I help people to
take practical action,

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.853 align:middle line:84%
small steps that can make
a very big difference.

00:45:51.853 --> 00:45:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so interesting.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Because your work is you
didn't do this to create

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.670 align:middle line:90%
a brand like people can do.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.802 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
create a brand of--

00:46:00.802 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
you're shaking your
head like, heck no.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: All I know is I
say it was not strategic.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:90%
If it were, I'd say that.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I formed a clear strategy.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But, no, I just opened my
heart, opened my mouth.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
write and speak.

00:46:13.425 --> 00:46:15.973 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's cool because
it created its own brand.

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Peaceful Warrior created it.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah, now
it's become that.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It did.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And would you say
that it's a brand that

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.510 align:middle line:84%
identifies with people finding
their path, finding their--

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I read that.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a community that
it creates amongst people.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I think there's
something about the term.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, the
seminars I've taught,

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:84%
workshops wherever
I teach, about 50%

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:84%
of the people in the audience
are male and about 50 female.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
there's a balance there.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
I know is striving

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:48.610 align:middle line:84%
to live with a peaceful heart,
but recognizes there are

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.490 align:middle line:90%
times we need a warrior spirit.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, well sometimes
I'm too much warrior.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I really
use too much will

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:90%
to get something to happen.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And it comes with an edge.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It comes at a little
bit of an edge--

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.813 align:middle line:90%
a lot of it.

00:47:02.813 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: There's a game we
play in some of my workshops.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, good.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: We do a
hand-clapping game.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And we learn to assert
ourselves in the right moments,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:90%
but also--

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can we do it?

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.913 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Well, we could.

00:47:13.913 --> 00:47:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, we can
try it sitting down.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.085 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to see if
you can get your partner

00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:90%
a little off balance.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm
tense, for example,

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.885 align:middle line:90%
you do a really assertive push.

00:47:23.885 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: First, towards you.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.593 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Then I
can get off balance.

00:47:26.593 --> 00:47:30.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, but if I also
know how to receive,

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.500 align:middle line:90%
and take in, and relax.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Then if you push, there's
nothing to push against.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like push hands in tai chi,
but it's a very accessible way.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.735 align:middle line:84%
So you learn there are times
in life to assert yourself.

00:47:41.735 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are other times
to receive, and listen,

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and open up.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So it helps us
balance our character.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being the
good girl or the nice boy

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:84%
all the time, there are times
we want to really be forthright.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But other times-- sit,
and listen, and take in.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have trouble
with one or the other.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us
back into balance.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the first laws in my
book, the laws of spirit,

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.670 align:middle line:84%
is about the law of balance,
not overdoing or underdoing.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a constant challenge.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:84%
When I go to the Y to work
out, how hard do I push?

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Do I push so hard that
I get great results,

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.605 align:middle line:84%
but I wake up in the morning
going, oh, here comes workout?

00:48:20.605 --> 00:48:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Or how do I find the balance
where I can enjoy it, but also

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:26.670 align:middle line:90%
get some results?

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So balance in every
aspect of life

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.225 align:middle line:84%
is a quality we can
all benefit from.

00:48:31.225 --> 00:48:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a tough one.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard there is
no such thing as balance.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:84%
You're really never right
on the balance beam.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.960 align:middle line:84%
You're usually on
either side of it.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.293 align:middle line:84%
Gymnasts-- first, they
begin, and they fall off.

00:48:45.293 --> 00:48:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But as they get better,
they get more refined.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And they have a little bobble.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing like
perfect balance, because moment

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.690 align:middle line:90%
to moment.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's no such thing
as balanced exercises.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.388 align:middle line:84%
What is balanced
exercise for an Olympian

00:48:58.388 --> 00:49:00.680 align:middle line:84%
may be different from somebody
who's a beginner or just

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.910 align:middle line:90%
rehabilitating.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to find
our own balance of what

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:90%
works for us day to day.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is
a good-- great example

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of on and off balance.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.772 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look here at Dan

00:49:12.772 --> 00:49:15.230 align:middle line:84%
showing another example from
the book, "The Hidden School."

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Not long after
I met my old mentor, who

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I named Socrates, he
gave me a business card

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:33.670 align:middle line:84%
with three words--
paradox, humor, and change.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.210 align:middle line:84%
These words, these ideas
appear again and again

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.590 align:middle line:90%
in "The Hidden School."

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.690 align:middle line:84%
In reading the saga,
reading the adventure,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.130 align:middle line:84%
there are many
humorous incidents

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that happened that remind
us cosmic sense of humor

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.690 align:middle line:84%
can be very, very useful in
approaching the challenges

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:90%
of everyday life.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And change-- well, I
have radical changes

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
demanded of me by
page 2 in the new book

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and throughout the book.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Not predictable,
but change happens.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most important
point in "The Hidden School"

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.860 align:middle line:90%
revolves around paradox.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.755 align:middle line:84%
Paradox, the reader
will learn, is

00:50:14.755 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:84%
a key to understanding some
of the major questions of life

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.430 align:middle line:84%
about big issues like free
will, and time, and death,

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and whether we're all one or
whether we're separate beings.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So understanding paradox is
a key and a recurring theme

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:90%
throughout "The Hidden School."

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.490 align:middle line:84%
This approach to
living is not so

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:40.120 align:middle line:84%
much about fixing our insides,
so that we can go out and live.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having
perfect, positive thoughts

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.770 align:middle line:90%
or an entirely quiet mind.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having
the right emotions,

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.600 align:middle line:90%
so we can go out and live well.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it focuses on action,
our response to each moment.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us
looking back will

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
see that our lives
have been shaped

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.735 align:middle line:84%
by what we have done
moment to moment,

00:51:01.735 --> 00:51:03.610 align:middle line:84%
not just what we've been
thinking or feeling.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Humor-- how
important it is.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is just
because we have

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to not take
ourselves too seriously.

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.667 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really
gets in the way.

00:51:15.667 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And by humor, it's not just
about laughing or telling

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:90%
jokes.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a tension release.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's more about a
non-serious approach,

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.640 align:middle line:84%
not taking ourselves
so seriously.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.370 align:middle line:84%
This character Dan Millman
has a lot of quirks,

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and he's just doing
his best in life.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So I don't take myself
so seriously anymore.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I take my work
seriously, I guess.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of a
cosmic sense of humor.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I remember a cartoon.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it showed two men
up on a dungeon wall--

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.150 align:middle line:90%
long beards.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They're shackled by
their arms and legs.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And one turns to
the other and says,

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.820 align:middle line:90%
psst, now, here's my plan.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's human
spirit, isn't it?

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: That's
the human spirit.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's my plan.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have grandchildren.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really
but laugh and giggle

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.342 align:middle line:90%
when you're around them, right?

00:52:02.342 --> 00:52:03.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: They're
great teachers.

00:52:03.758 --> 00:52:05.680 align:middle line:84%
We all know children
can be great teachers.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Young, too.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, if you were to
look back and find out,

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:84%
what is the massive
purpose here?

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.930 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest why as
to the reason that you've

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:18.750 align:middle line:84%
written all these books
and everything that you're

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:90%
teaching?

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do this?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: I can
say with confidence

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I haven't the faintest idea.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Life remains a
mystery to me, Lisa.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.017 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the first
time I've heard that.

00:52:30.017 --> 00:52:30.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.138 align:middle line:84%
People usually come
with this deep,

00:52:33.138 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:84%
meaningful-- you're
like, no clue.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: No, it's a mystery.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.580 align:middle line:90%
I just do what I do.

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're hardwired
to be who we are.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just continuing
along that path,

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.900 align:middle line:90%
trusting along the way.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then, how do
you know what's next?

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It'll appear.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I respond to it.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It may appear inside.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It may be a movement in me.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But I just wait, and watch,
and stay open to opportunities

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:90%
as they occur.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you do also have
a goal in mind, don't you?

00:53:05.305 --> 00:53:06.105 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:53:06.105 --> 00:53:06.905 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:06.905 --> 00:53:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But only-- maybe it's become
more short-term goals.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What in the moment can I do?

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:14.010 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose now?

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
When I walk out of here, when
I do something to meet friends

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:84%
tonight, I'll have
a different purpose.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But overall, I seem to
have found a particular joy

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in sharing in my own way.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Other people, also,
are called to do that.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And I encourage them.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:84%
My daughter and I wrote
a writing book together

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.430 align:middle line:84%
called "The Creative
Compass," where

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:84%
we encourage people to follow
their own creative impulses

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in writing.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's really not so
much about me anymore.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about, what can I
do to touch other lives?

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever
wonder about retirement?

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Or what's your plan
for the future?

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.173 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does that
ever cross your mind?

00:53:55.173 --> 00:53:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Not really.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: No.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Some people that works for.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:90%
But you know the saying.

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.595 align:middle line:90%
It's been repeated many times.

00:54:01.595 --> 00:54:03.720 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make God
laugh, tell God your plans.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Plans change.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So I find short-term goals
are more realistic, usually

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:84%
by definition than
making a long-term goal.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But again, any
goal can be useful,

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.260 align:middle line:90%
because it gives us a direction.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
always useful.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, your
short-term goal of health

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:90%
is working for you.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yeah.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.710 align:middle line:90%
But I'll grow old, too.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're like old cars.

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.535 align:middle line:90%
You need tune-ups now and then.

00:54:31.535 --> 00:54:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
their own challenges.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I mean, I love--

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us about your
daily exercise routine

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.403 align:middle line:90%
now, still at 73?

00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Well, I start
early in the morning.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:10%
As soon as I get up,
I do various exercises

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.770 align:middle line:10%
that I've learned--

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:48.900 align:middle line:10%
my Peaceful Warrior Workout,
but also, some of them

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:10%
look like physical therapy
to help different liabilities

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.650 align:middle line:10%
I've developed from all the
pounding I did in gymnastics.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I found some friends
at the Y. I go to a gym,

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and we work out a little bit.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But everything can be done
at home on one's carpet

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:90%
using body weight.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a great, very
natural way to exercise.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But when someone says, I want
to be fit, you have to ask,

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.000 align:middle line:90%
fit for what?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to run a triathlon?

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to be
able to walk upstairs

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.090 align:middle line:90%
without getting winded?

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's an individual choice
of what kind-- what we do,

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and what fits our body, and
our mind, and our emotions,

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and what we can sustain.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.420 align:middle line:84%
No matter how fit we
get in a boot camp--

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:84%
unless you sustain that level,
you don't stay that fit.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's, what simple things
can we do day to day?

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like
short-term, minimal things

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.580 align:middle line:90%
we get done every day.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.693 align:middle line:90%
And we start the day right.

00:55:43.693 --> 00:55:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And also, community.

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.840 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned that.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.355 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned meeting people and
doing community-like exercise.

00:55:49.355 --> 00:55:51.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MILLMAN: Well, in the
spiritual traditions,

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:10%
there is the Buddha
or the teacher.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:54.640 align:middle line:10%
And we all have
different teachers.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:10%
There is the teaching--

00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:00.270 align:middle line:10%
the Dharma, and then the
Sangha, or the community.

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very useful.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We've all read about
how people tend

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to live longer if they have
connections with family,

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.420 align:middle line:90%
with friends.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So to develop those--
it's not easy.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.420 align:middle line:84%
New York City-- we moved
there five years ago--

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: --to Brooklyn,
New York to find people.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's great,
taking up a subject,

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:20.285 align:middle line:84%
something where you meet other
people with common interests.

00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It can be very healing.

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:22.758 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why New York?

00:56:22.758 --> 00:56:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: Oh, I had four
reasons-- two daughters

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and two grandbabies.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.625 align:middle line:90%
Those are good reasons.

00:56:27.625 --> 00:56:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So you went closer
to the family,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.125 align:middle line:90%
and you got to participate.

00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.792 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLMAN: That's our
center of gravity.

00:56:31.792 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Keeping up
with grandchildren

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.820 align:middle line:90%
will definitely keep you young.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a lot of fun.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Yes, it is.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, thank you
so much for being here

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and sharing your wisdom with us.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And we look forward to whatever
it is that you bring us next.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: It's a delight.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a total delight.

00:56:45.995 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Thanks for inviting--

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: --me.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for talking about
purpose and really bringing

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:49.980 align:middle line:90%
that home for us--

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLMAN: Terrific.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.037 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And thank you so much
for joining me in this show.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:59.660 align:middle line:10%
So thanks for sticking
with me to the end.
