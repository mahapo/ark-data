[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever felt
that your belongings

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:90%
are running your life?

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, not surprisingly, that
is one of the greatest stresses

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:10%
on relationships: our stuff.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:10%
It creates conflicts in
all of our relationships.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
The questions such as where our
stuff should go, how much of it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:10%
we should keep, and
whether or not we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:10%
should bring it home at all
haunts millions of people.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:10%
Brooks Palmer started out as
an expert in clearing cutter--

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:10%
clearing clutter,
but soon realized

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:10%
that he was playing
marriage counselor

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:10%
when dealing with people
in all of their attachments

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:10%
to our stuff.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Clearing clutter,
easy for me to say.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I wanted
to talk about you is we

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
have this recession going
on for quite a long time now

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and people are
starting to downsize.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are downsizing.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is creating a
lot of stress individually

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and within relationships,
starting to deal

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
with what stays and what goes.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And, really, the book
that you've written

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
has much more to do with
psychology and relationships.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Your other stuff was really
more designed to help people

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:90%
just deal with the clutter.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
This one is really about
how we are psychologically

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:90%
dealing with clutter.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I might ask
you right off the bat,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
are you need freak?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have clutter
issues yourself?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, my
mom used to yell at me

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.445 align:middle line:84%
cause I would leave all
my clothes on the floor.

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:10%
You know, my MAD magazines
and piece of paper

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:10%
and-- I didn't care, I just
used the floor as a desk

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:10%
or a surface, you know?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:10%
And she would scream
at me and I would

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:10%
never do anything about it.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:10%
And it didn't change me at all.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it doesn't make me
change how I live my life.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:10%
But when I went to art
school, my professor

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:10%
talked about how it's important
to have a clean work surface.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
That, when you're
not distracted,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
you're able to think more
clearly and your ideas flow.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And, so, I found that that
works really well in the work

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And in my life too, I like
to keep it really simple

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
so that I enjoy the
things that I love.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's going to
become a really key part

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation,
is how our lives have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:90%
been co-opted by our stuff.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know people-- I've
seen this over and over

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
where-- girlfriends
of mine-- where, they

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:90%
won't even engage socially.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They won't have people
over to their homes

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
because they're so
embarrassed about their stuff

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
flying all over the place.
-Sure

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And almost becomes shut-ins,
in a sense or shout-outs.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Who don't want to share their
homes with other people.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've found-- because
I've been helping people let go

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of clutter for about 10
years-- and many people

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
are very embarrassed
about the clutter

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:90%
they have in their homes.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that people
are going to judge them.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they feel
like they're the only ones

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that are living this way.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's a shame thing?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And right off the bat I let
them know that they're not.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Because people will say,
like, am I your worst client?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Is this the worst
place you've ever seen?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.224 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm going to tell
them, yeah you're terrible.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, I would never do that.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And, really,
everybody has clutter.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
My definition of clutter
is, anything in your life

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that's no longer serving you.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's-- at one time it was.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we bring into our
life, we feel like it's going

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:90%
to help us, whatever that is.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:90%
But then things don't help us.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And some things help
us but then they stop.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK to have clutter.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to have these
things around our house,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize,
like, I have clutter.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
I want to encourage

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
people rather than feel badly
-Right.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And lock their doors.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Even though-- or-- be shut-ins.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Shut the
world out, right.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to go, like, all right,
everybody's got clutter.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I change my needs change.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
things around me--

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I now longer wear that shirt.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with that book.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't listen to
that CD, whatever.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And go through your stuff.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And make kind decisions.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
By kind, meaning, like,
not being mean to yourself.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And, that's OK.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through--
do I want this cup or not?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Do I enjoy drinking from this?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a relationship
with everything in your life

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that's part of your life.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:90%
So, is this a good relationship?

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, I don't drink from
this cup, so I'll let it go.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very--
it puts you in touch

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
with your heart for the source.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to really look
at, then, your relationships

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:90%
with your stuff.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And it really gets into
some-- that's a loaded one.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
One friend of mine right
now-- her husband-- the kids

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
are out of the nest, her
husband wants to move on,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
they have a big house,
large piece of property

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:90%
to maintain-- he's tired of it.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And they have collected so
much stuff in their life

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that, like, a move isn't
even up for debate.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because she doesn't want to
have to deal with having to get

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:90%
rid of stuff.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
So they're immobilized now.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's
hard on the couple.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard on the couple.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes they'll
take it out on each other,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen that.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Because clutter does that.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Clutter-- it's like
it possesses us.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It has a very destructive and
a manipulative and exhausting

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So, we start to act as
if we've been drugged.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's like
this albatross.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and people, if
they live by themselves,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.367 align:middle line:90%
will take it out on themselves.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Saying they're a pad
person or that they

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
feel bad about their lives.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.597 align:middle line:84%
Or members of the couple
will bite at each other.

00:06:15.597 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You've been in the
middle of a lot of these.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Reading your book,
I mean, you're

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
standing there with people
tearing each other apart

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:90%
over their stuff.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well I had
this one couple--

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
they were-- they had little
rabbits, two rabbits,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that ran around on the floor.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had concrete
floors, so they

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
could clean up from the rabbit.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But they were screaming at
each other in their bedroom.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.687 align:middle line:84%
Like, veins popping
out of their neck.

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [LAUGHING]
That's uncomfortable.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Their faces were red, yeah.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you
were just brought

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
in to help them clear clutter?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.289 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, they hired me for that.
-OK.

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of soft
spoken, so it was hard for me

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to tell them to stop
screaming at each other.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
They said they weren't
hearing me, you know.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.981 align:middle line:84%
And one of the rabbits
went under the bed.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So, for some reason,
I thought, all right,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I'll look under the bed.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that there was a
carpet that the bed was on.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And this carpet was the
source of their argument.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
So, it was all about carpet.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I don't
like the carpet.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, that
carpet's from my family.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you ever support me?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, well,
why don't you think about

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:90%
me first before the family?

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:90%
That was all about the carpet.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.955 align:middle line:90%
OK, so, faces are red.

00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:30.354 align:middle line:84%
Veins are bulging.
-Yeah.

00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The carpet was
covered with hundreds

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:90%
of pieces of rabbit poop.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Those little round pellets.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] Yeah.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just heaps of rabbit
poop all underneath there.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And the carpet itself was
soaked with the rabbit urine.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't
even-- here, they're

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:90%
arguing over this thing.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, essentially, it's like the
house is burning down, right?

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Here they have the very
precious thing that they're

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
arguing over has
already been destroyed

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
and no one's paying attention?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.381 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they notice this?
BROOKS: Because--

00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Did they?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, they
didn't notice it.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.965 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could've
been accumulation

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of living under this carpet
that they both disagreed about.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But also, too, the way
they spoke to each other

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:90%
was clutter.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, deep down, we're
sensitive creatures.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And, so, we think because that
we need to protect ourselves.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And we surround ourselves
with things that we think

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:90%
will build a protective wall.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But we lose touch
with that sensitivity.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.026 align:middle line:84%
And that couple of
lost touch with that.

00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
So, they couldn't
communicate with each other.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
were screaming.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing with the
rabbit and the carpet-- well,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.394 align:middle line:84%
basically what I did was, I
told them-- I yield really loud.

00:08:44.394 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And they stopped
screaming and they

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
checked out underneath the bed,
and they saw what had happened.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They must've
been embarrassed.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but they were also quiet.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:90%
There was this sobering effect.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you guys can't
talk that we to each other.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like stabbing each other.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It's really intense.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't serve
the relationship.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship itself
is a thing as much as the bed

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
as much as the red, the
rabbits, and the rug.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes we forget that.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So, it was sobering
because they saw that.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time, they connected.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They must have realized
how unconscious each of them

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
are being to allow
this to accumulate

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and happen surrounding
the very subject

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that they were debating.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
-Well, yeah, probably--
-Yeah.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:90%
On some level they did.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And we had to spend some
time cutting up the carpet

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.940 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
do anything about it.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And they started actually
talking to each other.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, saying
something and being

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:90%
heard, back and forth.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
profound for them.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, and
that's really part of it

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
is feeling judged,
like you said,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:84%
misunderstood,
not heard when you

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:90%
go into conflict over stuff.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'll talk
about some of that.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But there was another man
you wrote about in your book

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and it really was a
very tender subject.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
He was a tough guy,
really tough guy, and what

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:90%
you would call a hoarder.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I know you don't like that word.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you like
that word, number one?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we would
classically refer to him as.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't move
through the house,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
garbage and stuff.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the word hoarder.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's often used during clutter
busting talks and such.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a common
phrase that's used.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Generally, people tend
to think of hoarders

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:90%
as that's what clutter is.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that's where
people's minds go.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Clutter are the people
who have so much stuff,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
they can't walk
down there hallways.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have clutter, you
know, so I'm not like that.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And also, too, it's often
used as a critical word.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, somebody who's overweight,
calling them fat, or something.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:90%
It's oh, that hoarder.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.169 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen that
show, Hoarders, you know?

00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, it is
a very loaded term.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I like to-- those
people in those situations,

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
they're like that because
they're in a lot of pain.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And they've surrounded
themselves with a lot of things

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:90%
to try to insulate that pain.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a conscious choice.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It's done automatically.
And so--

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Tell us about that
man, that particular guy.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Sure, he was like
Charles Bronson.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Looked like Charles Bronson.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Wore black clothes, you know?

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had six
locks on his door.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Didn't want anyone to
break in and steal his stuff?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very defensive.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And he had sign on
his door, "Occupants

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
are home and our armed"--
like, underlined, "armed."

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And he let me in and he was
like, [HUMMING] you know,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:90%
didn't say much, and very gruff.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a
tour of his place.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.835 align:middle line:84%
And there were
passageways, but they

00:11:48.835 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:90%
were sort of curved around.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And the stuff piled high.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It was about eight feet
high, with bungee cords

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
so it wouldn't cave in.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had polio as a
kid, so he had leg braces.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had to manage himself
through those corridors

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:90%
with these braces.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And he slept on the
floor curled up.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And there was no sunlight and--

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's sad.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking-- it was
the first time I thought,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:90%
how can I actually help him?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Because there was so much
stuff and he was so distant.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And we got the top floor and
he goes-- all of a sudden

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:90%
he just opens up.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And these little tears
come in his eyes.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I'm so embarrassed
to be living this way.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.761 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
that was my way in.

00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yes.
So I was like, all right.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:90%
And I had a trash bag--

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.561 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: He hadn't always
lived that way, though.

00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.165 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: He'd had a trauma
of some kind in his life.

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
He had gotten
fired when you could

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
fire people for being older.
-Right.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like, he was fired and
he was-- get out of the office

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:90%
today and he just gave up.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
For about 10 years he just
started barricading himself

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:90%
in his house.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And he literally
didn't-- I mean,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
he told me he put a shotgun
in his mouth every night.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to pull the trigger
because it was so painful.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But he could never
pull the trigger.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So, that's how much
pain he was in.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I mean, this
is really extreme.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And you did ultimately--
it took time.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.894 align:middle line:90%
You had to do it in baby steps.

00:13:24.894 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: Yeah, everyday.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I was there for
about five months.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you were
able to help him?

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
REGINA: What happened?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:90%
How did he feel in the end?

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:90%
He was so jubilant.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, I had no judgment
about his situation.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So, as soon as he said,
I'm really embarrassed

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to live this way, I had
a bag and I picked up

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.951 align:middle line:84%
an empty Diet Coke liter, and I
said, do you need this anymore?

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
No.
You know, a little bottle.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.317 align:middle line:84%
He goes, no, I guess
I don't need it.

00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And I put it in the bag and I
just went through each thing

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And he started
thinking that way.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it takes.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like, all right, I've
spilled soup on the floor.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I need to clean it up.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of that
matter-of-factness.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Cluttered stuff spills
throughout the house.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:90%
You work on a little at a time.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's not overwhelming.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And he was willing to go
through that process with you.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is something--
when we feel that we are

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.841 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed by our stuff, it's
overwhelming to even think

00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
of tackling it.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's easier just to shut the
door on it, close the closet

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and
not deal with it.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Which causes a different
kind of anxiety.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
There is anxiety
that's constantly

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
running in the back of your
life, then, isn't there?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why I started the
book out with his story.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.827 align:middle line:84%
Because, on some level,
everybody's situation

00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%
is like that.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:90%
We're overwhelmed.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And we give up.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, for us, overwhelmed
is the garage-- there's

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
too much stuff in the garage.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Or our desk is too cluttered.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.594 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's
got a threshold.

00:14:56.594 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Everybody
has their-- and even

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
if they're a tidy freak, it
can't be tidy enough sometimes.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes
you're going crazy

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
if there are two
papers on your desk

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:90%
that are not lined up properly.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's another kind
of obsessive behavior--

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
obsessive compulsive.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:90%
It does happen.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, places that
look really neat

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
can have just as much
clutter as the guy's house

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that I told the story about.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Because just because it's
nicely stacked doesn't mean

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.077 align:middle line:90%
it's part of your life.

00:15:25.077 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because we're
talking about, again,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
relationship to your stuff and.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the kind
of house that this man--

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I went through-- I ended up
in a home like that one time.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.025 align:middle line:90%
I had to use the bathroom.

00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was at place
out on a farm.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was riding their
horses and I asked

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:90%
if I could use the bathroom.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And, so, they
hesitantly let me in.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well
they must not trust me.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized why
as soon as I went in.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It was just like that.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
There were little pathways
and there were Coke cans

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and there was wax paper,
old sandwich wrappers.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little child--
it appeared to be grandparents

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
raising their grandchild.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
little child, so tiny,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:90%
wandering through all of this.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was their life.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And that brings me to this
whole thing about children.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we start these
patterns early in life.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at some of
the gross amount of gifts,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we give our
kids on birthdays and holidays.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.205 align:middle line:84%
The cycle-- let's
talk about childhood

00:16:22.205 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and where this cycle
begins for many of us.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you learn a
lot from your parents.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
You see your parents
gathering stuff into the home.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And people, when
they buy stuff--

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
bring stuff in-- they're
always jubilant and happy.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.144 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
good about it for them.

00:16:40.144 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Everybody's happy.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And, so, they start to see--
and the stuff doesn't leave.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It comes in, and if it's trash--
if it's, like, old food or, you

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
now something that's papers that
are torn, you threw them out.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of stuff just
comes in and stays in.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So kids learn how to
acquire but not to let go.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And you just start to
see, I need things.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:90%
I must need things to be happy.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:90%
I must need stuff.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And people talk about stuff
with a certain excitement.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Or kids see commercials.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
You know, they learn
from commercials.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, if you get
your Little Pony toy,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be really cute
with your little blonde pony

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.671 align:middle line:84%
tail, hopping down the
street with little sparkles

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.370 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] An exciting
life, a fairytale life.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
 --spend millions of
dollars on advertising

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and your friends will really
like you if you have this toy.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is the same
thing they tell adults.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So, you're really getting into
this whole acceptance thing.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
That we feel we have to
have this stuff in order

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:90%
to be accepted.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And little kids are particularly
susceptible to that.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Any kid that watches
television-- it

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:84%
always makes me kind of sad when
I see little kids at a birthday

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
party maybe a four-year-old
or three-year-old

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
with piles of gifts
in front of them--

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
or during other holidays.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And they just start
tearing through it

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.193 align:middle line:84%
and throwing it aside
and it's like being a kid

00:18:07.193 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:90%
in a candy shop, literally.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.435 align:middle line:84%
Not even acknowledging one
thing because their attention

00:18:13.435 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is already drawn to the next
shiny ribbon and package.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with all this
stuff that, a lot of times,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is never even utilized.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just tucked away
into little boxes, bins,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and into their closets.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.241 align:middle line:84%
So, that's a beginning
point for all of us on that.

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: Yeah.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to limit
the amount of presents.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind thing
to do to your kid.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, usually you
think kindness is just

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:90%
giving them a lot of stuff.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's nice to teach them,
here are two or three things.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.647 align:middle line:90%
We really thought you'd love.

00:18:45.647 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and paying attention
to what it is they're

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
really resonating with, what
they can use and interact with,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe on a creativity scale.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:84%
But this whole story of stuff--
there's a really good video

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
on YouTube called
The Story of Stuff

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and I would encourage
anybody to look at it.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But someone else did
their own story of stuff.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to roll
the tape in just a second.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:90%
It was one of our favorites.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
George Carlin did a little
video on stuff that some of you

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:90%
may have seen before.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's worth taking
a look at again.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.884 align:middle line:84%
So, let's take look at
George Carlin and Stuff.

00:19:16.884 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE CARLIN: I would have been
out here a little bit sooner,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
but they gave me the
wrong dressing room.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find any
place to put my stuff.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how you are, but I

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.696 align:middle line:84%
need a place to put my stuff.
So--

00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:27.395 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:27.395 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
--that's what I've
been doing back there.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.697 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to to find
a place for my stuff.

00:19:30.697 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:90%
You know how important that is.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole-- that's
the whole meaning of life,

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.129 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:36.033 align:middle line:84%
Trying to find the
place for your stuff.

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:90%
That's all your house is.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Your house is just a
place for your stuff.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have
so much good stuff,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't need a house.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You could just walk
around all the time.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all your house is.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a pile of stuff
with a cover on it.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
You see that when you take off
an airplane and you look down

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and you see everybody's
got a little pile of stuff.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got their
own pile of stuff.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you leave your
stuff, you gotta lock it up.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't want somebody to come
by and take some of your stuff.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.695 align:middle line:90%
They always take the good stuff.

00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't bother with
that crap you're saving.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Ain't nobody interested in your
fourth grade arithmetic papers.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
for the good stuff.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:90%
That's all your house is.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a place to keep
yourself while you go out

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and get more stuff.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes-- sometimes,
you've got to move.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
You got to get a bigger house.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Too much stuff.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got to move
all your stuff.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And maybe put some of
your stuff in storage.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that, there's a whole
industry based on keeping

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
an eye on your stuff.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Enough about your
stuff, let's talk

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:90%
about other people's stuff.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever notice when you
go to somebody else's house,

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
you never quite feel a
hundred percent at home.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:90%
No room for your stuff.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else's stuff
is all over the place.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:90%
And what awful stuff it is.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Where did they get this stuff?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you have to stay
overnight at someone's house,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, unexpectedly,
and they give

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
you a little room to sleep in
that they don't use that often.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Someone died in it 11 years ago.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't moved
any of his stuff!

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Or wherever they
give you to sleep,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
usually right near the
bed there's a dresser

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's never any room on
the dresser for your stuff.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Someone else's shit
is on the dresser.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.865 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
that their stuff

00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:90%
is sh*t and your sh*t is stuff!

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.958 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes, you go on
vacatioN-- you got to bring

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:90%
some of your stuff with you.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't bring all your stuff,
just the stuff you really like.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that fits
you well that month.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
gonna go to Honolulu.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.923 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna go all
the way to Honolulu.

00:21:58.923 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
two big bags of stuff.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.644 align:middle line:84%
Plus your carry-on stuff, plus
the stuff in your pockets.

00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
You get all the way to Honolulu
and you get in your hotel room

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
put away your stuff.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
you do in a hotel

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.767 align:middle line:90%
room is put away your stuff.

00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some stuff in here,
put some stuff down there.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
place, stuff here.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll put some stuff over there.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:84%
You put your stuff
over there, I'm

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
putting my stuff over there.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.003 align:middle line:84%
Here's another place
for some stuff--

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We got more places
than we've got stuff!

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna have
to buy more stuff!

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.245 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:25.245 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [CHUCKLING] I
think he said it perfectly.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think most
people can relate

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:90%
to certain portions of that.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, even the part
that he was talking about,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
staying at other
people's houses.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You stay in a bedroom and you
got a little dresser and all

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
their stuff is on there.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I have a hard time with that.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to be
surrounded with other people's

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And this is the thing.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
When you come into personal
relationships between people,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
this is where it starts
getting really dicey.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Say intimate
relationships, you're

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:90%
going to try to cohabit now.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And this really becomes the
source of a lot of discord.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think we
can all remember

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that when we met our
significant other a you think,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
you really want to
bring that wagon

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.181 align:middle line:84%
wheel coffee table into
the living room [LAUGHING]

00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
So, how do you deal with that?

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about that couple.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- say we're
not at each other.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:90%
We're all newly in love.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:90%
We want to move in together.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
But we're having
issues about our stuff.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's good to sit
down and talk about-- when you

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
first moved in, I would
suggest recognizing

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that that other person
cares about those things

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:90%
they're bringing in.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And if anything is
said disparaging

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
about any of those
things, the person's

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:90%
going to take it personally.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Because we relate to our stuff.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We feel like it's
an extension of us.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, too, there's
a sense of wanting

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to control someone when
you tell them-- when you

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:90%
try to make them do something.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And people I hate
to be controlled.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
We feel like an object.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
We're no longer a person.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:90%
We're being manipulated around.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And control can also be a way of
clutter, controlling somebody.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it cuts
off the connection

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.886 align:middle line:90%
from the other person.

00:24:20.886 --> 00:24:22.052 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So you're
saying clutter is

00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:84%
anything that's standing in
the way of life, of connection?

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, my experience
is that connection

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best feelings
that we could possibly have.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of ads show
things as, if you get this,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll be connected to your mom,
to your friends, to whatever.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Because they recognize
how powerful it is.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Things will never
give us connection.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:90%
People do.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Activities that
we really love do.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, so, it's
important to recognize,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
this relationship
is a powerful thing.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And we like this connection.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So, as we talk
about these things,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
as they come into the house--
or a couple that's been together

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
for a long while,
you want to consider

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:90%
the relationship first.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you question things, does
this support the relationship?

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Or does what I have to say
about the other person's things

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:90%
support the relationship?

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
To leave yourself open
and be kind, you know?

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.567 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: A little sensitivity
training is in order.

00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
really-- just that one

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.704 align:middle line:84%
piece of advice there: don't
make disparaging comments.

00:25:33.704 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Can I tell
one quick story?

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I had this couple-- she
had all these shopping

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
bags, very shiny, Neiman
Marcus kind of bags.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Saving them?

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she had over a hundred.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And he was like-- the husband--
oh my god, I can't believe

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
she she has all these bags.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:90%
He was saying that to me.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he would tear into her,
you don't need all those bags!

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.224 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, you don't
need those bags.

00:25:57.224 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you just get rid of them?

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And she was shrinking.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard
on her, you know?

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:07.487 align:middle line:84%
She was in pain because she
was connected to those things.

00:26:07.487 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to
let them go and he

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.450 align:middle line:90%
just was not helping her.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.501 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him, I said,
could you just stop talking?

00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
how many of these bags

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
do you think you need?

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I really wanted to know.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I was curious.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I never
thought about that.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, like, five.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, all right,
let's pick the five.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:90%
So she did.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:90%
We threw out the rest.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And her husband's mouth
was like a cartoon.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:90%
The jaw dropped.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [LAUGHING]
It dropped open.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It dropped open.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is the best way
for you to talk with your wife.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so used to pushing
people to try to motivate them,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:90%
again, to try to control them.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that backfires on us
because the connection's cut.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So how can we be open with that
other person and help them.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we help
ourselves by doing that

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
because a relationship blossoms.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.022 align:middle line:90%
The communication flows.

00:27:05.022 --> 00:27:05.722 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:27:05.722 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And, see, we forget that it is
a relationship with stuff, which

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about already.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But we are very careless
in our words with others

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because we think, oh
come on, it's just stuff.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're not stopping
to think about all

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
of the emotions
that are attached

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to these things, these
things in everyone's lives.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And as George Carlin
was saying, we

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.780 align:middle line:84%
have houses so we can
store all this stuff

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and protect all this stuff.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I can see where
I've been insensitive in, well,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
either defending my own
stuff or about someone

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:90%
else's stuff on occasion.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm thinking, oh
it's not life or death,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it's just stuff.
BROOKS: Yeah.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.904 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:27:43.904 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it ends up.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It can end up in really quite
a conflict if you let it go.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
other nuances we

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about because we're
going to take a little break.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk about
things like divorce.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
When your excellence
wants to store

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:90%
their stuff at your house.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
About things like
inheritance, what

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
happens when you
inherit all this stuff

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:90%
that was precious to others?

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.682 align:middle line:84%
And much more, so
we'll be right back.

00:28:08.682 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we get into
the really touchy

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
stuff: divorce, inheritance,
and much more-- gifts.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm imagining
every person listening

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to this has had some kind of
stress over these situations,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:90%
if not all of them.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:90%
So, let's start with divorce.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, your relationships has
gotten out of control, maybe

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%
over your stuff, who knows.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But it is disintegrated
to the point

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:84%
where you're going
to now call it quits.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And now you have to part.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of our viewers have

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:90%
probably been through this.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
This is difficult on
many levels, obviously.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at it from the
attachment to the things we've

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
accumulated together and even
extended into what happens when

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
one person is maybe
downsizing and going away

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to a little apartment
and the other person's

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
keeping the house and now they
want to keep their stuff there.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:10%
Right, so, first off, it helps
to admit that there's pain,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:10%
that there's a lot of pain
because this connection had

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:10%
to be severed.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:10%
And there may be
arguments over things

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:10%
that are more about the
pain rather than the stuff.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: Right.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:10%
It's going to color everything.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: Making a power
play and using an item

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:10%
that maybe both of you
value as a sticking

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:10%
point there, a win-lose.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And pain, when it's infused in
our body in a way like that,

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:90%
we don't even notice it.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a constant.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And, so, we can take it
out on the other person.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Or it can get about the stuff
and it's really about the pain.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had a client
who, half of her garage

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
was filled with her
ex-husband's stuff.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had been
divorced for two years.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
He'd been living
in his own place.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I asked about
it and she said,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:84%
well, he has a really
small apartment,

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.590 align:middle line:84%
so he can't have
all these things.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just letting him
keep his stuff here.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And she shrank when she talked
about it you could feel like--

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: She was deflated.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I said well how does
it feel-- actually,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.284 align:middle line:90%
I pointed out how she shrank.

00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, I have this
feeling every time

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
you drive into your
driveway, you're

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:90%
just reminded of the divorcee.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it was tall,
quite a tall stack.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this
monster of her pain

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
just leaping on her
every time she comes in.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, in the garage.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And she goes into her
house with that feeling

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's hard on her.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then she told me
that, because she asked

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:84%
for the divorce, that
she felt that she

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
would hurt him more by telling
him his stuff has to go.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So, I said, I don't
think it helps him

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
for you to take
one for the team,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or
to take a bullet.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said it's important for
you to take care of yourself.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And-- she had a daughter--
I said, otherwise,

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching your daughter
that it's OK be hurt,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:90%
to knowingly be hurt.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:90%
And she got it.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And she called him up.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said, look, I
have to have you come

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:90%
and start getting these things.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And he argued about it
and I said, stay strong.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Probably tried to lay a
little guilt trip on her:

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.426 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're the one that
wanted me out of here.

00:31:55.426 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, these common dilemmas.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and she said
no, and I need you to.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So they worked it out that
he would come once a week

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and get things and
bring them back.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, she felt
better by doing that.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that worked for
him and it worked for her.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a relief
in her by doing that.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the relief that comes
from getting rid of clutter.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:31.730 align:middle line:84%
In any situation, clutter is so
restrictive and hurtful on us.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And we get used to that.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And we don't notice it anymore.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But as we start to
let go, we start

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.860 align:middle line:90%
to feel the relief right away.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And, so, that's
what she noticed.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Just start clearing
the relationship

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and clearing the guilt
and clearing the clutter

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
all at the same time
because it is all all

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:90%
attached to one another.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And, now let's talk about
something that is, I think,

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:90%
very difficult for people.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's the subject
of inherited items

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that your grandmother, great
grandmother, mother, father

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:84%
may have found very
precious to them.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But it has no-- you have no
connection with those things.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
You didn't accumulate
those things.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens-- or what
I think my experience is,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:84%
is that oftentimes people
hang on to inheritance stuff

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:90%
that they don't care about.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know they don't care
about it because I'll say,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
this table here, do
you like it or not?

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Can we let go of it?

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I inherited it
from my grandmother

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and I think I should keep it.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:90%
So they don't like it.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But they feel because it's an
inheritance-- and, so, what

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
ends up happening
is, people start--

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard when someone
dies that you're close to.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And there's sorrow.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And, so, to get
rid of their stuff

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.170 align:middle line:84%
feels like you're getting rid
of them even more, like finally.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There's this reminder
that this is from grandma.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's not grandma.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But it feels life if I let
this go, I'm letting them go.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I'm going
to hang onto this pain,

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.739 align:middle line:90%
because it is painful.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Because this reminds
you of your grandmother.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it makes
you angry at your grandmother,

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that she gave you something
that you don't like.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:90%
But you have to hang onto it.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a love and
anger at the same time.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, in
addition, you see people,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
when it comes down to
the time of inheritance,

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
you see siblings, for
example, when a parent dies,

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
starting to fight and argue
over make a power play and grab

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:84%
for all this stuff
that none of them

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
necessarily even want
a lot of the stuff.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Well, again,
there's this feeling of,

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
this person's gone that
was a big part of them.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
And it's like trying to
grab a piece of that person.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
the underlying thing.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:90%
What's going on.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard when
people are in that place

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're emotionally
disconnected from each other.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So, they can't go, I'm
really missing my father.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: This is
about missing Dad.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:90%
This isn't about his stuff.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, is it healthy,
in a lot of cases, for a person

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to say, you know, that's
a picture of dad when we

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:90%
were fishing together as kids.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I remembered him.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And, gee, I'd love to
have his tackle box.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that a healthy
way of holding on--

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to say
holding on to something,

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or taking responsible
inheritance, so to speak?

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Yeah, if it
feels good to you.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's your decision.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it
comes down to is,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:90%
how does it make you feel?

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.666 align:middle line:84%
Like the tackle box, I would
say to somebody, how does

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:90%
the tackle box make you feel.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I love-- I'm going to
leave it out on the table

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
so that every time I walk
by it reminds me-- you know,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to put in
a box or storage locker.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's not
part of your life.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.611 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, it really comes
down to that relationship again

00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:90%
and how it makes you.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into the dynamics of that.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about gifts.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a really difficult one.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
People scramble,
saying, oh my god,

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:90%
they gave me those earrings.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I better put them on before
they come over to the house,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.761 align:middle line:84%
Again, where you're
operating out of guilt

00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're running
around trying to please

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
everyone because someone
has given you some stuff.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: It's amazing,
the clutter of gifts.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It just amazed me when I
first started doing my job.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, what about
this glass, do you like it?

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.681 align:middle line:84%
No.
Can we let it go?

00:36:44.681 --> 00:36:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't.
Why?

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, my uncle gave it to
me and what if he comes over

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and wants to see it.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Where's the glass?

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he's going
to get-- he's going

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to be angry at that person.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So, people would
hang on to stuff

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that they don't like to
try to manage somebody

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:90%
else's possible experience.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to live that way.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And, again, here's this person
you're trying to please.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of you that's
angry that you've got something

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.364 align:middle line:84%
in your house that you don't
like because they gave it to

00:37:17.364 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and they put you
in this situation.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right, so
you're a slave to it.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I love it when people have
birthday parties and say,

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.770 align:middle line:90%
just bring yourself.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Or make a nice little
dish to share with others.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And, that, I find it such a
relief when you know you're not

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
scrambling to try to figure out
what does this person-- what

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:90%
could they possibly want?

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't need anything.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Because, by this time, most of
us don't need anything in life.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not college kids.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can give
somebody an experiencing,

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.580 align:middle line:84%
take them to a concert
or a restaurant.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But, these gift things--
it is OK to go, all right,

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let it go.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And if the persos-- the
odd chance of person

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.547 align:middle line:84%
asked about it: where's
that glass I gave you?

00:37:56.547 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, most
people would be

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.509 align:middle line:84%
too embarrassed to ask anyway.
-Yeah.

00:37:59.509 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:90%
No one is going to ask.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But if they did, you
could tell yourself,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I decided it wasn't
for me anymore.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you gave
it to me for my birthday.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But I donated need it so
somebody else could use it.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's a
nice way to do it.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%
That's a nice way to say--
that's politically very good.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's from the heart.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.239 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you just
said that I thought,

00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:20.290 align:middle line:90%
well, that's really sweet.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:84%
That's really
considerate to make

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.630 align:middle line:84%
sure that the item continues
having some usefulness

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Yeah, and then
you take care of yourself,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
which is the main thing of
clutter busting-- what serves

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:90%
you, and removing what doesn't.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a healthier
way to live.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you're much
more open to the world

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.464 align:middle line:90%
and to other people.

00:38:42.464 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, when you hear
people that do go through

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and say, I just
cleaned my closet

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and gave my clothes
away, there's

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
always this kind of
lightness of being

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:90%
about them when they do it.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
faced with having

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.170 align:middle line:84%
to take that task on
initially, it's like, I

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.450 align:middle line:90%
don't even want to go there.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Yeah, I always thought
it was funny that the feeling

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.904 align:middle line:84%
that people want
from their stuff,

00:39:05.904 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:84%
they often get that feeling as
they're letting the clutter go.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [LAUGHING] Exactly,
that's the irony is they're

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:90%
letting go of that stuff.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they get
a sense of freedom.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And they get the thing.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said, it's exciting
when you get something.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But as human beings, we
adapt really quickly.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.450 align:middle line:90%
It's in our nature.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been around us
since caveman times.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:90%
We have to adapt quickly.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So, anything that's
new assimilates.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And, so, the newness wears off.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.203 align:middle line:84%
Well, then let's
talk about where

00:39:34.203 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:90%
the newness doesn't wear off.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about collections.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: Okay.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I always find it
interesting-- I

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.500 align:middle line:84%
used to giggle when I
saw these billboards

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:90%
for these guns and dolls shows.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get my
mind around the couple going in

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and-- I understand it.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.765 align:middle line:84%
So, the guy's buying
his guns and the woman

00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:90%
is buying more of her dolls.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And the guy hates
the woman's dolls.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:90%
She hates his guns.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:90%
And, so, let's talk about it.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But you're justifying it
because this is not garbage.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a collection.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:90%
That's our justification.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a collection.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that do in terms
of holding the other person

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
hostage and yourself.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, first off, it's hard
to tell somebody that's not

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
open to hearing about a
suggestion about their stuff,

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to tell them something
about their stuff.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
openness to receive it.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And, oftentimes,
people will tell

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
somebody, why do you have that?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
you keep these things.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And that person takes
it very personally.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:90%
They relate to these things.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying
something bad about them.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But yet, your
collection may be infringing

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
upon your space to the point
where your collection is

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.690 align:middle line:90%
taking over your living space.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So, you're talking
about the person who

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:90%
has to live with that stuff?

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I had these clients--
they're in the book--

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.954 align:middle line:84%
where the guy asked me, he says,
is it OK to have collections?

00:41:09.954 --> 00:41:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, well, what
are you talking about.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I have these
fishing bobbers.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The things that sit on top
of the water so the line

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:90%
goes off that.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.896 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I have over 1,500.

00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK, great.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Because, right away I'm
not going to be judgmental.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I just want to see
how he feels about it.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But his wife is sitting
there like this.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Like fuming, you know?

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [LAUGHING]
She hates his bobbers.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I go, you don't
like them do you?

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I hate
that he has those.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.590 align:middle line:84%
She goes, when he's not looking,
I throw some of them out.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she said that
in from of him?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.499 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I tell him all the time, why
do you have all those bobbers?

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, but I like them.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So he liked them.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were arguing--
they start arguing

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.680 align:middle line:90%
about it back and forth.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying some pretty
mean things to each other.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how long have
you been arguing about this?

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Like, how many years?

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:90%
They said like 15 years.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So I said, so you want her to
stop telling you-- you want her

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.390 align:middle line:90%
to like that you have these.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, you
want him to hear you

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and can get rid of these things.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And neither of you is changing.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But the relationship
is suffering.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Because when you talk to
somebody that harshly,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.370 align:middle line:90%
relationship takes a hit.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.610 align:middle line:84%
It's hard on the
relationship to be--

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're open
to the other person

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:90%
and those words go right in.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Like bullets.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Little poison darts.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So, I said, the
relationship is a thing too.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I need for you
to both-- I mean,

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll help
you both to see that.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And, tonight when you go
to bed, or when you wake up

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.930 align:middle line:84%
in the morning,
say how can we deal

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.300 align:middle line:84%
with this differently
in a way that

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:90%
makes us be open to each other?

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It puts the relationship
before the bobs,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and the resistance to the bobs.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
to them ultimately?

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I worked with
them up to that point--

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, up to that point.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it's bye,
so you don't know

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:84%
if they're still arguing all
these years later about that.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:90%
No, I left it in their court.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was very matter
of fact with them.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's important to
eliminate what the clutter is.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:90%
The clutter wasn't the bobbers.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on some level it was
for her, but not for him.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But for the
relationship, the way

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
they approached it was
clutter to the relationship.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So, if they could be
more open about it,

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe she goes, I
hate that you do this,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:90%
it's really hard on me.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, hey, I hate
when you tell me that.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.374 align:middle line:84%
And at least they're coming
from an honest place.

00:43:53.374 --> 00:43:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe
something could happen.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he goes, all right,
well, maybe I could have 500.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.971 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, maybe I could stop
telling you to not have any.

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You know?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And find a compromise
ground because, again, it's

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about relationship
with each other

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.250 align:middle line:84%
before relationship
with stuff, ideally.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
who use their stuff

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:84%
passive aggressively to
hold others hostage too.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Like a big, you
know-- to you on that.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting rid of it.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
trying to do a power

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
play because of some other
kind of pain going on.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: And, again, that happens
because they're in so much

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:90%
pain, they can't see clearly.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like it's
going to make a difference.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's more like a bomb.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like dropping a bomb on a
country to get them to change.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
really work that well.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: There's another one
you talk about in the book.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is about people
bringing their work

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.360 align:middle line:90%
into your personal space.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I know I have this problem
because I do a lot of research.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:10%
I have the books stacked
up by the bed sometimes.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.940 align:middle line:84%
First thing in the
morning, my mind

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
is onto whatever it is
that I'm researching,

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%
the last thing at night.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And it drives Scott, my
husband, absolutely crazy.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I want to
ease into the day,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to ease out of the day.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm [MAKES BUZZING SOUND],
you know?

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.520 align:middle line:90%
All around it.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
couple that you talk

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.420 align:middle line:84%
about in the book
where both of them

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.990 align:middle line:84%
have their work stacked
all around them.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, was that by
their bed stands?

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I helped them dismantle
their bedside tables.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, I said,
it's really hard-- first off,

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to sleep with
all that next to you.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you take that with
you when you go to sleep.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Truely.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.220 align:middle line:84%
 --yeah, and were
sold on distractions.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We're sold on having a TV in our
bedroom and then to have books

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:84%
by our bed and to just have
things that we constantly

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:90%
are interacting with.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But then they distract
us from-- like,

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:84%
they were distracted
in their relationship

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:84%
from all all the
stuff by their bed.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is--

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.880 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What happened
when they got rid of it?

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:84%
There was just this--
their hearts open up.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.160 align:middle line:84%
People's hearts literally--
you can see it in their faces

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:90%
and their bodies.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they start reacting
to each other differently.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, the connection
can come back between them.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and the
interesting thing is,

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.890 align:middle line:84%
we tend to go for distractions
when we're missing something

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:90%
really primal in our life.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So, they were missing
their connection.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's natural.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you get
used to someone.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:90%
You get used to another person.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
take them for granted.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
move away from them.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But then your connection
starts to leave you.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
feeling badly.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So, you bring stuff into
your life to try to fix

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:42.890 align:middle line:90%
those little holes, you know?

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But then, those things add to
the cutoff in the connection.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So, at some point,
hopefully you can go,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:84%
the connection
between us matters

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:90%
more than all this stuff.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, that's really
primo in this conversation,

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that if
we've lost our way on that,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.110 align:middle line:90%
that's where we have to begin.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:90%
We have to go back to center.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Is this relationship
between us important?

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, then you have to
start looking at how you can

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.070 align:middle line:84%
functionally deal with all these
ancillary issues of your stuff?

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And, now, let's talk about
the actual technical part.

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where you started
this whole journey of clearing.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: Sure.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So, we say, OK, I get
that I need to start

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.090 align:middle line:90%
clearing some stuff out.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.630 align:middle line:90%
But I feel overwhelmed.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe, you've
procrastinated.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:90%
You've put it off for months.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've even
procrastinated for years.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And the day has come to do this.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you take that feeling
of overwhelm away from someone?

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.642 align:middle line:84%
You lift it from
them, that burden?

00:47:41.642 --> 00:47:43.242 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: You mean when I'm
working with them or--

00:47:43.242 --> 00:47:44.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, first off, I take
a tour of their house.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said,
they're usually

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:90%
very uncomfortable and anxious.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They're worried about
how I'm judging them.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're not used to having
somebody over and seeing

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.125 align:middle line:90%
their place uncovered.

00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But, since I don't have any--
I'm not making bad comments--

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and, usually, I try to
look for good things.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Like I look for things about
the way their house looks,

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.840 align:middle line:90%
or compliment them, you know?

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Or compliment them.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.306 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So you set them
at ease, but they still

00:48:15.306 --> 00:48:17.064 align:middle line:90%
have to get rid of their stuff.

00:48:17.064 --> 00:48:17.930 align:middle line:90%
So, how does that process?

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to find-- I look
for the place that makes them

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the most uncomfortable,
the place

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to start in.
And I--

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you make
them go there first?

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll just say
really matter of factly,

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.010 align:middle line:90%
let's just start here.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'll sit on the
floor with them.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're cautious.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.530 align:middle line:90%
But I'm very curious.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And that curiosity helps.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So I have trash
bags, one for trash

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.004 align:middle line:84%
and one for recycling
and one for charity.

00:48:43.004 --> 00:48:44.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You come armed
with your trash bags.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.169 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:45.169 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just go and pick
up the first thing.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Because, what happens is
they're seen everything.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're overwhelmed.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.090 align:middle line:90%
They see everything.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're not seeing
it, they're aware of it.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And, so, they're not capable
of making any decisions.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just hand
them one thing.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll say-- have them
hold it-- I'll go,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.970 align:middle line:84%
do you like this or
can we let it go?

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:11.014 align:middle line:90%
Very matter of fact.

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Um, yeah I like that.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.666 align:middle line:90%
I use it.

00:49:13.666 --> 00:49:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But another thing is, well,
I don't really care for that.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.860 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's let it go.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Keep it very simple.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It really helps
to have a third party

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:84%
or a second party there to
just say, OK, there it goes.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you're
going to the maybe piles.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Right, and, can
I put this in maybe?

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe?

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.550 align:middle line:90%
But maybe, maybe means no.

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's a way of
delaying getting to know.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Cause if you love something--
like do you love your jacket?

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I like this jacket, yeah.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say I love it.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.740 align:middle line:90%
But I like it.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I had it made just for me.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.280 align:middle line:84%
-And it feels good on you?
-Yeah, feels good.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.689 align:middle line:84%
Serves the job.
Yeah.

00:49:55.689 --> 00:49:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Great, so it feels good.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:58.629 align:middle line:84%
So then, you like it?
REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So, you didn't go into
a lot of explanation

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:90%
about why you should keep it.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I spent a lot of
money, or whatever.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So, it's the simple
yeses that are things

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.320 align:middle line:90%
that are a part of our life.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we have a lot of
words-- you know, oh,

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.627 align:middle line:84%
I need this because
what if I need--

00:50:14.627 --> 00:50:15.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't need it but what if I--

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.226 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, then it's a
mental rationalization.

00:50:17.226 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not really,
organically from the heart.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.137 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't need
it, but what if I need it?

00:50:23.137 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So, we really-- this is
the hard part, for women:

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:90%
shoes, purses, clothing.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure
men have equivalent

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.570 align:middle line:84%
with old sporting equipment
and that kind of thing.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But for most of the women
I know, this is a problem.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:40.934 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: Yeah.

00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's interesting.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a
client not too long ago.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And she had quite a
lot of pairs of shoes.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:52.200 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Someone else has
a lot of shoes. [LAUGHING]

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, I said,
well, let's go through them.

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I handed her
one pair at a time.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, you know,
um, I can't get rid of those.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But she made this face,
like something was up.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, well what
was that about?

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
they look really good

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.340 align:middle line:90%
but they hurt my feet.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So I wear them for
certain events.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, Yeah but they
hurt your feet, right?

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
She goes, Yeah, but
I have to wear them.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:10%
So, I said, whenever
we do something

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:10%
that knowingly hurts us,
and we try to justify it,

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.680 align:middle line:10%
it's really hard.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:10%
It's a real big blow.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:10%
It's like saying, it's
OK for me to be hurt.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right, that's
insulting ourselves, really.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's like--
and I understand.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.120 align:middle line:84%
People tell us that
it's OK live that way.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Other people live that way.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:90%
But you're saying no.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:90%
If it causes pain--

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.450 align:middle line:90%
If it hurts you, let it go.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:51.450 align:middle line:84%
 if it causes pain
emotionally, if you--

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I know you also
wrote in the book,

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:55.380 align:middle line:90%
if it creates a lack of energy.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it and
your energy deflates,

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:84%
listen to your
energy and your heart

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.990 align:middle line:84%
before the rationalizations
of the mind.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.160 align:middle line:90%
On everything, right?

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're checking in with
that, that immediate feeling.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And you could listen
to your mind too.

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:16.255 align:middle line:84%
But you want to just
beware of the-- all the, I

00:52:16.255 --> 00:52:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but I might need it for this,
or so and so gave this to me.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Or it cost a lot of money.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Or I need it for this, but
I don't really like it.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.910 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, have you
been through this process

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.090 align:middle line:84%
where people have been
particularly brave

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and you've gone through
this and you just

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.950 align:middle line:84%
insisted and they've hung
with you and been diligent

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and ended up getting rid of
maybe 3/4 of all their stuff?

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:40.380 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Yeah, easily.
-Easily?

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I usually
assume 60 to 70 percent

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of the person's-- their
things are clutter.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're bad or that
they're a waste, or whatever.

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:52.357 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
aren't part of their life.

00:52:52.357 --> 00:52:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
about things

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that aren't part of our
life that create a stagnant.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Or things that we don't like
that we hang onto because,

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.450 align:middle line:84%
however we justify,
it hurts-- it

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:09.251 align:middle line:84%
literally creates pain
and suffering in our body

00:53:09.251 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and in our mind.
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I see that because I see it
in people's faces repeatedly.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
When they want to hang onto
something and it's hurting them

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.840 align:middle line:84%
but they're justifying why
they need to hang onto it.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
discomfort in them.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, I never say,
you've got to get rid of this.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I point out the discomfort so
they realize, oh my god, yeah,

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:90%
it is really uncomfortable.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Because we sometimes miss that.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And when if you're
working by yourself,

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.687 align:middle line:84%
you can try to notice that
discomfort in your body.

00:53:40.687 --> 00:53:42.720 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, when you talk about
these people that have gotten

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.840 align:middle line:84%
rid of easily 3/4
of their stuff,

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.715 align:middle line:84%
brave souls that have gotten
rid of their stuff-- what

00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:49.700 align:middle line:84%
do you see as transformation
in their lives?

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it 100
percent transformative?

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.635 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Well, the transformation
happens the instant

00:53:55.635 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:90%
they start to let things go.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Meaning they start to
feel better right away.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they let go
of three or four items

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can see they
start to-- their color

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.180 align:middle line:90%
comes back to their face.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:90%
They seem brighter.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Their voice seems stronger.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask them, I'll say,
this space that you created,

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.240 align:middle line:90%
how does it feel?

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.665 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go,
what do you mean?

00:54:18.665 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, how does this
feel, this space right here?

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well,
it's actually nice.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard for
us to notice open space.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But open space really,
it's so good for us.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
we have nothing.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to have space.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.447 align:middle line:90%
It's nursing for us.

00:54:38.447 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask them
how they're feeling

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.260 align:middle line:90%
as they're letting things go.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, you
know, I'm feeling better.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So the transformation
is instant.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What about in
working spaces, where you're

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:90%
working within an organization?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a kind of mass
psyche to the organization,

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when
the organization just

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.590 align:middle line:90%
feels cluttered?

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:02.890 align:middle line:84%
BROOKS: Well, you lose
communication between people.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Because communication--
connection between people

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.620 align:middle line:90%
always suffers with clutter.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:90%
People don't think very clearly.

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They tend to think
more about the past.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Because clutter seems
to infiltrate our minds

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.110 align:middle line:90%
in a nostalgic kind of way.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But it takes away a lot
of the present moment.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.800 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a lot of old decisions.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't keep us
current in our thinking.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.257 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, not good
for a work environment?

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: No, for business.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've clutter busted
businesses and gone in,

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and people, again,
have gotten rid

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of 70, 80 percent of the
stuff that wasn't serving

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.220 align:middle line:84%
the business, that
they had never

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:84%
even thought about
because they've

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:42.590 align:middle line:90%
never questioned it that way.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Usually the new stuff
is always coming in.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Deal with the new stuff.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But the old stuff sitting there
interferes with the new stuff.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.090 align:middle line:90%
And the new stuff suffers.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's worth taking that time.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:56:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what's current
will think you.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And, so, again, transformation.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Always transformations.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Profitability even
goes up when clutter

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.280 align:middle line:90%
is busted in organizations.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:90%
BROOKS: I imagine it would.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you would think so.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So, we only have a
minute or so left.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So, just really briefly, with
the downturn in the economy

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and with people downsizing
do you see an upside

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.300 align:middle line:90%
in all of this for us?

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.800 align:middle line:84%
To have to start breaking
our addiction to our stuff?

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It makes us more aware of
the things in our life.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whenever there's
a kind of restriction,

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:37.760 align:middle line:84%
then we tend to assess
more of what's going on.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a natural
taking-care-of-ourselves

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.880 align:middle line:90%
thing that comes in.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And so, we start to look around.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And-- which is maybe something
we haven't done before.

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to do
it, and now we have to get

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.760 align:middle line:90%
down to what really matters.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
before we say goodbye,

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to offer you
a souvenir if you'd

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:00.090 align:middle line:90%
like to take a [LAUGHING]

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I kept talking
about the glass, right?

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'm just
taunting you with that.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.851 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to take
our Gaiam mug home.

00:57:07.851 --> 00:57:09.360 align:middle line:84%
No, I like it.
It's pretty.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.800 align:middle line:84%
-It is pretty.
-I love the symbol.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And the blue color's nice.
-There you go, OK.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wanted to
put you on the spot.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Brooks, thank you so much.

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly making me
think about how I can deal

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.050 align:middle line:84%
a little more sensitively
with some of my own stuff

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and how Scott and I might
do that together as well.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.731 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everybody's
gotten something out of this.

00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm glad.
You're welcome, Regina.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.860 align:middle line:10%
And I do, I hope
this has helped you

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.430 align:middle line:10%
sort through some
of your own issues

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:32.700 align:middle line:10%
surrounding your possessions.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:36.260 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, you can become
proactive by following some

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.490 align:middle line:10%
of the many exercises
available in Brooks'

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:41.030 align:middle line:10%
book, which is called
"Clutter Busting Your Life."

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:43.010 align:middle line:84%
You can find it in all the
main booksellers, right?

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Or online.

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
