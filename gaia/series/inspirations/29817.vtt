00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm coming to you live from
our Los Angeles Gaiam studio.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for joining us.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:10%
So did you know that more than
2/3 of Americans are on a diet

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.837 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:10%
This could be you
watching right now.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
Are you on a diet?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Do you lose weight and they
gain back more than you lost?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, with a staggering
$60 billion a year

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:10%
spent on weight loss, why do
2/3 of people who go on a diet,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:10%
fail?

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
My guests today are the
documentary filmmakers

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
of a film called
"Hungry for Change,"

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
James Colquhoun and
Laurentine ten Bosch.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to
help us understand

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
why unhealthy, fattening
foods make us crave them more.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.575 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:01.774 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN
BOSCH: Thank so much.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to be here.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad to have you
here because your information

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:90%
in your film is so clear.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's so groundbreaking.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And people need
to understand why

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.721 align:middle line:84%
is it that we crave these
foods that taste so darn good.

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It's such an interesting
question for us.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we started doing
research for the film,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
we really came up against
two really interesting

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%
pieces of information.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:10%
And like you mentioned, 2/3
of people who go on a diet

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
actually fail and regain more
weight than when they started.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:10%
That is so interesting that
there are so many people

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:10%
struggling to stay
on a diet or to have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:10%
success with it long term.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So really, as filmmakers
and researchers,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to get to
the bottom of that.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
about these types of diets,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and particularly diets based
on calorie restriction,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
or diets based on
manipulating the ratios of fat

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:90%
to protein to carbohydrates--

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: All which I've done.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when we
go on diets like that is it

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
can cause us to lose
weight for the short term.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.255 align:middle line:84%
But often it puts us
in this diet mentality

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:05.885 align:middle line:90%
that we talk about in the film.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, how often do
you go like, this

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is something I
know I can't have,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%
but I really want it right now.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, before that, you
never really wanted that.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.741 align:middle line:84%
So it really puts you into
that mental neurosis of--

00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
-It does.
-I can't have this.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And then after
you stop the diet,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
you're so excited to
eat all those foods

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
that you weren't able to eat.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So you're really
eating unconsciously.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to say, it's
unconscious eating for me,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because the diet puts
you in that place

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of lack and starvation.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the body
holds onto the fat.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Jon Gabriel, one of the people
we interviewed for the 'Hungry

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
for Change" film, was able to
lose over 200 pounds in a seven

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:90%
year period and keep it off.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But the secret to
success was being

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
able to shift his approach.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that more as we

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:90%
get through this interview.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But what he found--
he had the same

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
struggles that many people do.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
He would lose 10
pounds, then gain 20.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Lose 10 pounds, gain 20.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And he tried every diet.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
He worked face to
face with Atkins.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
He was working at
the Pritikin Center.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he did it all.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered,
which is some of the research

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that we show in the film, is
that his research is showing

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:90%
that diets make you fat.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Because what actually
happens is you're going

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
into this starvation mode.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of years ago
when we lived outdoors,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and we were running from bears
and surviving from winter

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
through summer and
different seasons,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
our body is biologically
adapted to store

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
fat when we're under stress.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
interesting point here.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So stress in our modern day
environment is prolific.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Getting to work on time,
paying off your credit cards,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and stress in the
forms of toxicity

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
from the environment and foods.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So these stresses on
our body are actually

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:90%
causing us to gain weight.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So do diets cause
your body stress?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
They do because it's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
putting your body in a
state of-- it's shaking

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:90%
your body's metabolism up.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You go from eating
one particular way,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and then you change
it completely.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And it changes your whole
body's biochemistry,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and when you do that,
your body has to adjust.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the problem is
that most of these diets

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
are not designed for a
long-term, lifestyle approach.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
So people go on
them and off them.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:90%
On them and off them.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Getting ready for the
summer bikini season or--

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.791 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Three
days, five days.

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is the body goes

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
into these shock-type modes.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's a stress on the body.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So the approach we'll
talk about later

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.327 align:middle line:90%
is such a radical approach.

00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's different to anything
that's been out there.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.093 align:middle line:84%
I have so many
questions for you.

00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But I want to find out, how
did you get started in this?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.615 align:middle line:84%
And what caused you
to make a documentary

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and be so passionate
about this topic?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, for Laurentine and I, it
was really quite interesting.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago we had no
idea how to make a film.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We were studying
nutrition, and we

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
knew that we really
wanted to help

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:90%
get this information out there.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And what happened for
us was we had a catalyst

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:90%
within my own family.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
My father was ill,
and he was suffering

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
from chronic fatigue syndrome,
depression, and anxiety.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's
burnout, middle-age,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
professional syndrome.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a
lot of it these days.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.544 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, yes, yes.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH: And we
would often send him books.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And we would send him
advice because we'd

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
been learning about nutrition.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that there were
things that he could do

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:90%
for chronic fatigue, naturally.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we would
send this to him.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And he wouldn't read it.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't read the books.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was bedridden.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
He was five years bedridden.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.634 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: How old was he?

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:10%
There was no way
he was going to read

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:10%
through a whole bunch
of pages to figure

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:10%
out what he could do about it.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: We actually
have a picture of him.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Of a before and after--
after you got to him.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So is there information
on-- I mean, how do you heal

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
chronic fatigue nutritionally?

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was interesting is
as we were studying nutrition,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
we found that there
was actually--

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:84%
there are single approaches
to different illnesses of

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
different problems in the body.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, as you start

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
studying natural
medicine, you realize

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that it's more of a holistic
approach that can help to treat

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and reverse the symptomatology
of many different types

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
of illnesses.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So in my father's case,
he was in his mid 50s.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:90%
He'd spent five years bedridden.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:90%
He had to sell his business.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
My mother became the
primary caregiver,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.451 align:middle line:84%
so it really shook
our whole family.

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But then on top of that,
he was also on a concoction

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of different types
of medications

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.947 align:middle line:84%
from pharmaceuticals and
Valium, and all sorts of--

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
You're explaining
most of Americans.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Antidepressants.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest problem for him
was that he had put his trust

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and abdicated his
responsibility for his health

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
to the medical profession.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And he really trusted that they
would have the answers for him.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But what this led
us to discover was

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that-- In our first
film, "Food Matters,"

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
we talked a lot
about the economics

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
behind the pharmaceutical
industry and the food industry,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
conspiring, not altogether

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:90%
for our ultimate health.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But more so, for a quick
fix, instant gratification,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:90%
symptomatology-based approach.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
helping my father.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And for many people
out there that

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
are suffering from similar
issues, which we talk

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
about in that first film
of ours-- depression,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, diabetes, weight gain,
cancer, even heart disease.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
approaches that we

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
can do naturally
that really help

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:90%
address the underlying causes.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: --and permanently.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So we knew we had
to take charge.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't just see this
happening in front of us

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and not do anything about it.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So we flew over, and we
sat down with James's dad.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And we said, look,
this is amazing footage

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
that we've collected from
these teachers of ours.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to do with you is we're

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.427 align:middle line:84%
going to put you
on a detox diet.

00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get you off the meds,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to put
you on to supplements

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that are going to help your
body regain its vitality.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.227 align:middle line:84%
We would tape his cabinet,
his pantry, and we'd be like,

00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
these are the foods
you're not allowed to eat.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
-The contraband.
-Yeah, the contraband.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Nice.
That's great.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:84%
We eliminated dairy and
meet for a short time,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and then we got him on juicing.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:10%
He was doing green juices,
and he was having sprouts

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:10%
and lemon juice for breakfast.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And he started to like it.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.806 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Clean, clean food.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
His body started
to-- his chemistry,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
his body chemistry started
to change internally.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Any he started craving
more of those foods.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
When you start to introduce
those foods to the body,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
the body doesn't have to
work as hard to digest them.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot
more energy free to be

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
able to do the things that
you want to do in your life.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's a transition.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
Once you start it, you
crave the clean foods

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.099 align:middle line:84%
because you realize how much
energy you've been expending

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:41.769 align:middle line:84%
on clearing the detoxification
and digesting the heavy fats

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:90%
and the toxins within the food.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It takes it.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:90%
It consumes our energy.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:10%
With this particular
hands-on approach

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:10%
that we had with my
father and showing him

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the entities we shot
for the "Food Matters" film,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:10%
within a few months--
after five years

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:10%
of this condition--
within a few months

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:10%
he was off his medications.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
He was starting to
lose weight, and he

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:90%
was really brightening up.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
He felt better than he ever had.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, throughout
this process,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
it's been about five years
since we went and helped him.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
He's lost 50 pounds.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:90%
He's kept it off.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.697 align:middle line:90%
He's running three times a week.

00:09:16.697 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:90%
He fits into your jeans.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
We share clothes now.
LISA GARR: What?

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.676 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: We have
a picture of him

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show the audience,
because this is the before

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and after.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:90%
He looks very happy.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:90%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: He is.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
There's the before photo with
his cat, his favorite cat

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And the after-- look,
he's just so fit and thin.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:90%
He sees his real self again.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And what was so inspiring about
that journey for Laurentine

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and I is we knew there
were so many people

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:90%
in a similar situation.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to find the most
effective way we could reach

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:90%
more people with this message.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And film became
the ideal medium.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:90%
So that was "Food Matters." a

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And how that led to
the more recent film,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
"Hungry for Change," that
we're talking about today,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
-- was through my
dad's transformation.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when
they would speak to him,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they would say
was not, hey, congratulations,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
you're off your medication.
You've beat--

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: How did you do that?
-It was how did you--

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:90%
You look amazing.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.684 align:middle line:90%
And you look amazing.

00:10:10.684 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And you've lost weight.
-You lost so much weight.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:90%
What was your secret?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to know.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.071 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and whenever I see anyone
who's transformed their body,

00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:90%
that the first thing I say.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
You want to know.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and that
really inspired

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
us to do some research into the
diet and weight loss industry.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you mentioned
in the introduction here,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
there's so much money
being spent in this space.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
ineffective approaches

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that are being promoted by
companies and individuals

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and organizations
throughout America

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and most of the western
developed world.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And we want to set
the record straight.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
that-- What is the myth?

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.757 align:middle line:84%
What is the big myth
that we're not seeing,

00:10:51.757 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're not getting here?

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Why is $60 billion a year spent
on something that doesn't work?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I think probably what is
the biggest myth for us--

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what were
you going to say?

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
is that people think

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
a diet is going to save them.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's more an approach
to nourishing the body

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and really shifting away
from the diet mentality.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.831 align:middle line:84%
That's moving outside of
that whole sphere into else.

00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:90%
What were you going to say?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's not
fair to put it on people

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because the amount of marketing
and the advertising that

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
steers people towards
the diet products

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and the fat-free products.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
That's really what-- as
part of making the film,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
we interviewed people outside
of the leading supermarkets,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and we would ask them if they
believed they were shopping

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:90%
healthy for their family.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And most parents would say,
yes, I'm shopping healthy.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And they would happily
show us their cart.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you would
see the diet products.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And you would see the margarine
and the fat-free products.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But they were doing
that thinking they

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
were doing the right thing.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when we spoke
to the leading doctors

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and nutritionists from around
the world-- who we asked

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:84%
what would you
suggest in regards

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.434 align:middle line:90%
to losing weight and vitality.

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
best thing to do,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.355 align:middle line:84%
and what the worst
thing would be to do.

00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, steer
clear of the diet product,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:84%
steer clear of the
fat-free products,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
steer clear of the margarine
and the chemicalized products.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
The 100 calories, yes.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
What we were really seeing
is-- we were seeing this mix-up.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like people don't
realize that this

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:90%
is where they should be at.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Whereas they're
trying all this stuff.

LISA GARR: This is only-- this
is one of the biggest points

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that I want to get through
to the listeners today

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
is to really get from
what you're saying,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that these products
that are marketed

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
to us-- about the sugar-free,
fat-free, 100-calorie,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
are the worst products
for your body.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They set up addictions
in the body.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.046 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
all about this.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.846 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: And I think
what Laurentine is saying

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
is there's really a disconnect
between the research

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that some of the great experts
we've got featured in "Hungry

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
for Change" are telling us about
nutrition in the diet industry.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing in
mainstream media, in magazines

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and newspapers, in
chemists and pharmacies,

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and the quick diet
fixes-- there's

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
this disconnect between what
is actually really healthy,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
being promoted to.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And to help clear that
up for people, for us

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
consumers-- people are
out there every day

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:90%
making purchase decisions.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure
that their money

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is being invested
wisely in their health

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:90%
and not being wasted.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: We have
a clip of the movie,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and I want to show
it to the viewers

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.867 align:middle line:84%
because it's something that's
going to really sum up a lot

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:90%
of what we're talking about.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into it in more detail.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this clip.

[CHIMES]

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Dear diary, today
I feel very sad,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and I want to eat everything.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.355 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we are
not eating food anymore.

00:13:39.355 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We are eating food
like products.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And they are adorned.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
They are made to look
better and smell better

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
so that people are
attracted to them.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault.
You're programed

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to put on fat whenever
there is food available.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But now there's a lot
of food available,

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's the wrong kind.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is in everything.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
In America, we're eating about
22 teaspoons of sugar a day.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Even the milk hasn't escaped.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:90%
So let me just show you.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
One kid, just the five years
of elementary school sugar,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.595 align:middle line:90%
just in milk.

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You might as well be
rolling up the kid's sleeve

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and putting in heroin.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the same.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:10%
The marketing essentially lies
to you because it presents you

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:10%
with the promise,
you're going to be

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:10%
sexy and popular and cool.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you're going
to be obese, and miserable,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
and sick.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else does it in your
brain quite like a diet cola.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there's
a deadly combination there

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%
of aspartame and caffeine.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
believe the FDA actually

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.775 align:middle line:84%
has their own scientists
to do this analysis.

00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:10%
But nothing can be
further from the truth.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
If I was in the food industry,
what am I looking to do?

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to sell you more food.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They're into just
selling a market.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You can lose weight
on a diet, but it's

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like borrowing
from Peter to pay Paul.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can get 10
pounds off your body

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:10%
through sheer force,
but you're going to have

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:10%
to pay back with interest.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
People know this, so why are
highly intelligent people not

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:90%
stopping?

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
the nature of the track.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The whole dieting
paradigm is flawed.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I was 31 when I
realized I don't know

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:90%
how to take care of myself.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
And I am sick.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go back and
learn all the things that I

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.132 align:middle line:90%
wish I had known as a child.

00:15:39.132 --> 00:15:40.614 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:51.424 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.424 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I've tried everything.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I did witch doctors,
I did mud baths,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
acupuncture, I did the lot.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The one thing which I was
really afraid to face up to

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.698 align:middle line:84%
was changing what I
put into my mouth.

00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:06.186 align:middle line:10%
I never heard of a
raw food restaurant.

00:16:06.186 --> 00:16:07.674 align:middle line:84%
Raw food-- how do
you cook raw food?

00:16:07.674 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I thought vegan was a planet.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I was over 400 pounds, and
I had very bad sleep apnea.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.034 align:middle line:84%
I was borderline
type 2 diabetic.

00:16:18.034 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing and
detoxification can

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's got
beautiful skin,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
it invites us to a deeper
understanding of what's

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.243 align:middle line:90%
going on inside their body.

00:16:30.243 --> 00:16:33.624 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.624 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
is a real diet in the sense

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:90%
of what a species needs.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
When we get onto our real
diet, we don't have to think

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:90%
about these things anymore.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
body's going to do?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
reject this at all.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It's going to look and
say, now I'm on board.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.901 align:middle line:84%
Now you're good to me,
let me shine for you.

00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
How much sugar do
Americans consume?

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're consuming more
sugar in America, Australia,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
United Kingdom, most of
the Western developing

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
world, more than we
ever had in the history

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:90%
of sugar consumption.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And as Kris Carr just
mentioned in the trailer there,

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:84%
we're consuming up to 22
teaspoons of sugar a day.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
So it's like taking
22 packs of sugar,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:84%
laying it out, and
just eating that.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
--gobbling them up.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now sugar is coming in a
lot of different forms.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You'll see most of
the processed foods

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:90%
have sugar in the ingredients.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're consuming
sugar in foods and in beverages

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and drinks, like in sodas.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So the amount of sugar
that we're consuming

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is coming from so many
different sources now as opposed

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to just simple fruit
sugars, or vegetable sugars,

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
or sugars that we would
get originally, or honey.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So those sugars
are OK, the fruit sugars,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
the honey sugars.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What does the other
sugar do to you?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: I think
that what we're talking about

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:90%
is the--

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
-refined sugars.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: The refined
sugars are the main issue here.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
experts in the film

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
go to show that sugar
is highly addictive,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and it is a drug-like substance.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And the way that sugar
impacts your body

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.941 align:middle line:84%
to cause these addictions
is really powerful,

00:18:15.941 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:90%
and you see it.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
You see so many people
that have to keep

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:90%
on that sugar bandwagon.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And what it does to your
hormones, and to your insulin,

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and to weight gain
is so important.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the key
aspects we need to really

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.854 align:middle line:90%
understand in our diet.

00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
And a lot of people

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
say that they can't get
off the sugar train.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
It is really a biochemistry
type of experiment.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Addiction.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.869 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH: --and
what's happening in the body.

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Because our body has
this type of PH levels

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that-- our bodies really
shouldn't be at that high.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we continuously
crave these sugar foods,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and we put them in our
body, we keep fueling that.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So really, it's from
a biochemistry level.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
said in the film,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not the fat
that makes you fat.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar--

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: --sugar
that makes you fat.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's the avocado.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And those are all good fats, but
it's the sugar that converts.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
And I think what's

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
really interesting
is that we have

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
gone on this whole war against
fat in the modern world.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:90%
It has to be fat-free.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
We have to be on fat-free
diets or low-fat products.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that fat is
really important for metabolism

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
in the right type
of fat, and we need

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.037 align:middle line:84%
good fats in order to be thin
or lose weight and stay healthy.

00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
--and have good skin.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.169 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But the sugar is really
the main culprit.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Christiane Northrup
goes to show, as you said,

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:90%
it's not fat that makes you fat.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It's sugar that makes you fat.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And really, our
relationship with sugar

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:90%
is pretty toxic at the moment.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
We're consuming
more than we ever

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:90%
have, especially teenage kids.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing
so much teenage diagnosis

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.081 align:middle line:84%
with adult onset obesity--
diabetes and obesity in kids.

00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
What about the
alternatives to sugar?

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.756 align:middle line:84%
Those little pink packages,
those little blue packages--

00:19:57.756 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones we should
really be avoiding as well.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
chemicals, really.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when they're
looking to go on a diet,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
reduce their sugar consumption,
then shop sugar-free.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
this disconnect

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
before was that there's a
disconnection between what we

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
think is healthy and what the
experts in "Hungry for Change"

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:90%
show is healthy.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
This is another one
of these conundrums.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.525 align:middle line:84%
People are shopping sugar-free,
but in sugar-free products

00:20:23.525 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:90%
are artificial sweeteners.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And these particular types of
sweeteners, such as aspartame,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:90%
can be very toxic for the body.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And if consumed
in large amounts,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
can cause horrible
hormonal chaos

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.555 align:middle line:84%
and even lead to
more weight gain.

00:20:36.555 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
More weight gain.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So what exactly is
aspartame, anyway?

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.601 align:middle line:84%
Is it a man-made
chemical substitute?

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: Aspartame is
a chemical that's made by man,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's specifically for-- it's
a low-calorie, sweet chemical.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with this
chemical, the most interesting

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
about it is-- it is correct, it
is low-calorie, and it's sweet.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's the perfect additive
from the food-industry

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that
aspartame has zero nutrients.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So when your body
consumes aspartame,

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
it tastes the sweet flavor,
and your body thinks

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're getting nutrients.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's no nutrients
actually delivered,

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
so this is the main problem.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's that apart from its
toxic neurological effects--

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
from a biochemical standpoint--
when you consume this additive,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and your body thinks
you're getting nutrients--

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and you aren't-- you actually
start craving more products,

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:90%
even carbohydrates.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the hidden
things is chewing gum.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Aspartame is in chewing gum.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And little kids love
chewing gum, even

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:90%
if it's sugar-free chewing gum.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's going right into--

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I have so many of my
friends that are addicted

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:90%
to these sugar-free gums.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
times they have-- it

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is associated with headaches
and painful migraines,

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes can't
come into work

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:90%
because of these migraines.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they don't
realize that it could be

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:90%
because of these chewing gums.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And they constantly have it.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.327 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly having
one after the other.

00:22:02.327 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes,
and two at a time.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
the chewing gums.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It could be in so
many other things

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
like cough drops and
medications for kids, as well.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole great
clip from the movie

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
that I want to show
the viewers here.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a clip about aspartame,
specifically from the movie,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.629 align:middle line:84%
"Hungry for Change."
Take a look.

00:22:20.629 --> 00:22:27.525 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.525 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If I was in the food industry,
what am I looking to do?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to sell you more food.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Now how can I do that?

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I can manipulate the chemical
structure of their food

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
so that it now becomes
not fulfilling, but empty.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But gives the impression when
they very first ingest it,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that it is the most fulfilling
thing they've ever had.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else does it in your
brain quite like a diet cola,

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's because there's
a deadly combination there

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:90%
of aspartame and caffeine.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And those two together
create a very unique blend

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of excitotoxin that
kills off brain cells.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But before they die,
they have this excitement

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that's like a buzz.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So what you find with
the diet cola addicts

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is that they'll drink sometimes
a liter, two liters a day.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
women do it as a way

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:90%
to keep their weight down.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They just have the next
buzz of diet colas.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame causes formaldehyde
buildup in the brain.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:10%
It causes frontal
lobe inflammation.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Migraines can be a common one.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Visual disturbances.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Symptoms that mimic
multiple sclerosis.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
There's headaches, there's
neurological problems.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Seizures in more serious cases.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.705 align:middle line:84%
Cognitive problems,
and can, in fact, lead

00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:90%
to different types of cancers.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most pilots
are aware that they

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:90%
can't drink diet sodas.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's well recognized
within the pilot association

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't drink this
because it can really cause

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
severe aberrations
in your vision

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that will potentially lead
to problems with your flying.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
That is very, very alarming,
but important information.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So why do these foods
make you crave them more?

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.521 align:middle line:84%
We started off
talking about this.

00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And to draw on some research
leading into this, one

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of the pieces-- one of the
quotes we show in the film

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is that Yale University--
this is Yale--

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
show that people who consume
artificial sweeteners actually

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
lead to weight gain and
carbohydrate cravings.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So that seems so strange because
we're taught in mainstream

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
media that the consumption
of artificial sweeteners

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:90%
is low-calorie.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It's good for if
you're on a diet,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
so you stick with the sugar-free
gum, the sugar-free sodas.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's
leading to weight gain.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the news.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what we wanted to
get to the bottom of it.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Because really, if you're
finding that people that

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.435 align:middle line:84%
are trying to lose
weight are then

00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
regaining more weight
because they're more

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
addicted to these substances.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
That was, for us,
that was crazy.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's the sugar-free
food that we are craving

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.324 align:middle line:90%
more that are making us fatter.

00:25:20.324 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
It's unbelievable.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like something out of a
sci-fi movie, really, isn't it?

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's
important to know.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's so
important about the film.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:84%
When people are
going on a diet, you

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
have to be really careful
about what foods you choose.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about going
and following the mainstream

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.850 align:middle line:84%
approach of I'm going to
go sugar-free, fat-free,

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:90%
because that is not working.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So going back to why aspartame
causes this weight gain-- which

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:84%
we started on just before the
clip-- was this concept of how

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
when you can chew
aspartame, it sends

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
this signal to
your brain saying,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:90%
hey, I've had something sweet.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But what actually happens
biochemically in your body

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is that you're not
getting any nutrients

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.214 align:middle line:90%
from that particular sweet.

00:25:58.214 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
So you get more of it.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: So then
you want-- you crave--

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, so
you want more of it.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: You
start craving more.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I see, that sets up--

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And you start
craving carbohydrates

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
because you're trying to fill
that gap of the nutrients.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It's this never-ending cycle.
-I see.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And then these-- other
than being a chemical,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's
been known to cause--

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have the
statistics on this,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
but you said it is
disruptive to the brain.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
Neurological problem,

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:90%
migraines--

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Formaldehyde build
up in the brain.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It mimics symptoms
in MS patients.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So it's a very
highly toxic substance.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And no one stops you when
you buy it at the counter.

00:26:34.085 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's right.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.163 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
anyone standing there

00:26:36.163 --> 00:26:37.194 align:middle line:90%
at the supermarket and say--

00:26:37.194 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It should say
the surgeon general warning.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
---that it's super
dangerous for you.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
That is has-- right,
that would be a good idea.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
All right so what
we're going to do

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
take a quick break.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.823 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to find out a little bit

00:26:47.823 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:90%
about what foods we can eat.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.914 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
just a little bit more

00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
because I want
people to understand

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:90%
the importance of MSG in foods.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Because that's in-- the
film said 80% of foods--

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
80% of processed foods.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: --of processed foods?

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:90%
MSG?

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's free-group
glutamate forms which

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
is under 50 different names.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:90%
So you got to be--

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be very aware
of what is in our food.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
We need to know
how to read labels.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.114 align:middle line:84%
We need to know what are
all these crazy names.

00:27:16.114 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --what's in the
food, and the fact that caffeine

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and aspartame together
is what causes

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:90%
that chemicals explosion.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: --and
so addiction as well.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:90%
I never knew that together.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And addiction, as well.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we come back, we're
going to talk a little bit more

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:90%
about MSG, what foods MSG is in.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
get into the whole idea

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
of what you should eat.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:84%
What we can eat, what's
readily available to us,

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
detoxification, juicing,
and all that great stuff.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So stay with us.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back about the
film, "Hungry for Change."

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
Gaiam Inspirations.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.014 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:49.014 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
Gaiam Inspirations.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my
guests are James Colquhoun

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and Laurentine ten Bosch.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And they are the documentary
filmmakers of the movie,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:90%
"Hungry for Change."

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit
about why these food companies

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:90%
put these items in foods.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:90%
--like aspartame and MSG.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:10%
What was really interesting
doing the research for "Hungry

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.210 align:middle line:10%
for Change"-- and this was
brought to light really

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:10%
by Jason Vale in
the documentary--

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:10%
--was that in the '50s and '60s,
the cigarette companies were

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:10%
knowingly adding and
increasing the nicotine

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:10%
content of their cigarettes in
order to make them addictive.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:10%
Now they got called out by
this and had to take it out.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big
kerfluffle about it.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually know that
until I watched the film is

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that they were-- as
people were becoming more

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
accustomed to the
nicotine levels,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:84%
they were increasing it
to adapt to the addiction.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way to keep
your customer coming back.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.975 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy, yes.

00:29:00.975 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what's happening
in the food industry right now.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There is an additive called
monosodium glutamate and E621.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And MSG is an
addictive additive.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Now they put this-- have
you ever wondered-- I'm sure

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
there's people out
there-- You go to a party,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
or you open a package of chips,
and you just don't know why,

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
but you have to get that
last little [INAUDIBLE] out.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH: You're
just going back for more.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what it is.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:84%
You get overtaken by
this-- I need to have more.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Or you go to-- you have some
sort of salty soup or something

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
at some sort of restaurant.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And you come home and
you've got a dry mouth.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got a headache,
you can't go to sleep,

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what's going on.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:90%
You've likely consumed MSG.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Now for most of us,
that's the symptomatology.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
For others, it's severe
headaches, migraines.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
people I've met

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
that have to carry a necklace
saying, I'm sensitive to MSG.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
If I go into a fit,
call this number.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.274 align:middle line:84%
It can be a very
serious food additive.

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
But actually, we

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
thought when we first made
the film-- we thought, MSG,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
isn't that what you find
mostly in Chinese restaurants

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
or when you go to
places where the food is

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
not really that kosher.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And it will say
MSG, monosodium glutamate,

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Right, but we actually
found that it's

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:84%
in 80% of all flavored
and processed foods.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that
there's a lot of foods

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:84%
out there on the shelves
that we didn't even

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
realize that have this in them.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:34.831 align:middle line:84%
So if it says the word
"natural flavors," is that MSG?

00:30:34.831 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: --often
have MSG in them.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:90%
What's natural about that?

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The tricky thing about MSG
is that MSG and this family

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
of free glutamates
can be called or known

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:90%
under 50 different names.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you see
monosodium glutamate,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:90%
you know that it's MSG.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Or you see E621.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:31:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you see yeast extract or
a tortula extract, or these--

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Modified food starch?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many of
these different names

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
where you look at them,
and you might not instantly

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
recognize them as MSG.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:10%
But given that they're in
that free glutamate category,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:10%
they have a similar
effect on the body.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most interesting
pieces of research around MSG--

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:10%
which I found absolutely
phenomenal-- which we talk

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:10%
about in the film-- was that if
researchers are doing research

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:10%
on mice in order to
study the effectiveness

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:10%
of obesity medication or
weight loss approaches,

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:10%
they have to first
make the mouse fat.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Or the mice fat.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.607 align:middle line:84%
Now how they do that
is they feed them MSG.

00:31:41.607 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
That is the protocol.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what they start with.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.485 align:middle line:90%
In order to make them fat.

00:31:45.485 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
start doing the testing.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So if they're making mice
fat by feeding them MSG--

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and this has become such a huge
part of our modern processed

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
food landscape--
it's little wonder

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're suffering from
such large rates of obesity.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if anybody's listening
to this, just Google it.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.341 align:middle line:84%
We say this in the film,
MSG, obesity-induced mice.

00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And you see it.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.940 align:middle line:84%
The research papers,
the fat mice,

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's-- we're consuming this.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.069 align:middle line:90%
So it's a really interesting--

00:32:13.069 --> 00:32:14.835 align:middle line:84%
So these food companies
have taken this information,

00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:16.741 align:middle line:84%
and they've seen
that this works.

00:32:16.741 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.777 align:middle line:84%
People will really-- they will
love-- this food will be yummy.

00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
People will buy
more of this food.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --because
the mice eat it.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The mice eat it, and it's
an addictive component.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's of strong
flavor, which we--

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:10%
We actually have a
still here of the photo

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:10%
of some of the foods
that you do find MSG in.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:10%
And some of these things
I didn't even suspect.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.577 align:middle line:90%
Like protein shakes, ketchup--

00:32:39.577 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
--salad dressings.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:10%
---salad dressings,
the drinkable yogurts--

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:10%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
--drinkable, instant noodles.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Instant noodles, in
particular, was a big one.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:10%
Like the flavoring enhancers and
a lot of the pre-made sauces.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.524 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: So is
it a preservative?

00:32:51.524 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:10%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: It's
not a preservative.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:10%
It's a flavor enhancer.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:10%
So it's called a
flavor enhancer,

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:10%
but I'd rather call it an
addiction weight-gain additive.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:10%
Really, that's what
it should be called.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.670 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a way to say that.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Many-- MSG-- We could
think about that one.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're really not
trying to put people down.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We're really just exposing
them to this information.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people--
if I tell someone

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
they can't eat
those chips, they're

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
really upset because they love
those chips They've become

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
familiar with those
chips, and they've become

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:90%
buddy-buddy with those chips.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's just about
exposing this information.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And once they start
realizing what's

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
really going on behind
the scenes, they'll shift.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: No, I can see how
that could be comfort food.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I love those chips.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That's my salty, crunchy,
carbohydrate, study food.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes comfort
food, and I can see why.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It tastes good,
it feels good, it

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.840 align:middle line:90%
takes me back to a good memory.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what we can
eat, and what is good for us.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:84%
When I look at
ingredients, and I

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
see things that I don't
recognize as food,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:90%
it really makes me wonder.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:90%
What is modified food starch?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:90%
What is corn whatever?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.909 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
is-- a lot of people

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:84%
see it as a daunting
task to have to go

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and redo their whole diet.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And it shouldn't be.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
premises we talk about

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:84%
in "Hungry for
Change" is to really

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:84%
counteract-- these diets don't
work-- research that exists.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.219 align:middle line:90%
These diets don't work.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So to really counteract
that, the best

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:84%
way and the best
approach you can take

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:90%
is this concept of adding.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a really great
approach because all you do

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
is you start to add more foods--
which we'll talk about now--

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.243 align:middle line:84%
more foods which are natural
and whole, and in a form

00:34:41.243 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:84%
that our body is familiar with
digesting and assimilating

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:90%
the nutrients from.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we just focus on
adding one of them a day,

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.050 align:middle line:84%
or two a day, and then you
start to build from there.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
taking anything out.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So you can keep
your chips, Lisa.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And everybody out there can
keep their little comfort foods.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But the concept is to just
add some of these food

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.380 align:middle line:90%
groups, which we'll talk about.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And really, when we're
talking about what to add,

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
it's really acknowledging
that our bodies have been

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.810 align:middle line:84%
biologically adapted
over millennium to deal

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:90%
with certain types of foods.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Now the introduction of
processed foods in the form

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
today has only really happened

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:90%
in the last 50 to 100 years.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very short period
of time in the evolution

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.130 align:middle line:90%
of our bodies on this planet.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But it's no
wonder why we are getting

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:84%
sicker and heavier
and more toxic

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because of the
introduction of these foods

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:90%
in the last 50 to 100 years.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And it makes perfect
sense why our children

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:90%
are being born sicker.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
first step would be,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:84%
though, to start to detoxify
from some of these foods.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.377 align:middle line:90%
Would that be a good first--

00:35:47.377 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
That's right, and we

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:84%
talk about detoxification
in the film as well.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And detoxification is a
great way to cleanse the body

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and clear it out.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
focus should always

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
be kept on adding
because that really

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.791 align:middle line:84%
clears the mental neuroses
around our relationship

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:90%
with food.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it is an emotional
relationship we have with food.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:10%
We always say, start
adding a green juice,

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:10%
even if it's just a
green juice a day.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Or just a big salad before you
have your lunch or your dinner.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Just have a really beautiful,
big, leafy, green salad.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So the introduction of the green
and the chlorophyll-rich foods

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
help to alkalize the body.
So soon--

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That helps.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:84%
--the biochemistry will
change, and you crave

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:90%
less of these toxic foods.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.747 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
clip in the film

00:36:30.747 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was
really important to show

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.880 align:middle line:90%
people about detoxification.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So that you can really
start to understand

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the importance of it, let's
take a look at that clip now.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best thing a
person can do in the beginning

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is clean themselves out and get
on a detoxification program.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Foods that detoxify the body--
some are really obvious,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and some are not.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Some the more obvious
ones are green vegetables,

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.530 align:middle line:90%
chlorophyll-rich foods.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:84%
In hospitals chlorophyll
is used, or was used,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
as an internal deodorant for
people who had a lot of body

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:90%
hard.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Chlorophyll is a great way
to clean our bodies out.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So those are, of course,
all of our well-grown,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:90%
heirloom, organic vegetables.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
These are fantastic for
cleaning our bodies out.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.270 align:middle line:84%
There's some less
obvious stuff as well,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
though, like
gelatinous plant foods.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
For instance, things like
chia seeds, or aloe vera,

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:84%
or the seaweeds--
these foods that

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.885 align:middle line:84%
have a gel that they
secrete when they get wet--

00:37:25.885 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And what those do,
those gels move

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:90%
through our intestinal tract.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
If we eat something
like chia seeds-

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:84%
if we can blend that
into a drink some way,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
or something like that--
and get it into our bodies,

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:84%
these gelatinous fibers move
through intestinal track,

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
absorbing things, binding
them, and passing them through.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.605 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, what they do is
they absorb the bile salts that

00:37:45.605 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:84%
are released by the liver, bind
those up, and pass those out

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
with all the fat-soluble
toxins the liver's

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have these
gelatinous fibers,

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.500 align:middle line:84%
we tend to reabsorb
a lot of that.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So the liver tries to get rid of
something, puts it in the bile,

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.090 align:middle line:84%
dumps it into the
small intestine,

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
hoping that it eventually
gets out of us.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:90%
But it gets reabsorbed.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So gelatinous
fibers can really do

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot to clean out the liver.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention two
other ingredients that are

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
especially useful for detox.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:90%
That is parsley and cilantro.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Now parsley cleanses
your entire blood supply,

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and it also gives
you fresh breath.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Parsley has so much chlorophyll
that it just cleanses you

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:90%
whole system.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:10%
And cilantro binds
with heavy metals.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are
getting mercury, especially

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:10%
through the fish
that they're eating

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:10%
or through their
dental fillings.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat cilantro,
it can bind with that

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and remove it from your system
so that the mercury doesn't get

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:90%
lodged in your body's cells.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And mercury, as you
know, is very toxic.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.724 align:middle line:90%
It's a neurotoxin.

00:38:49.724 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't want that anywhere
in your brain cells, right?

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But cleansing our bodies
is not complicated.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult. It's
just going to require

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.770 align:middle line:90%
high-quality, green plant food.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.225 align:middle line:84%
It's going to require
gelatinous fibers.

00:38:59.225 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
require good water.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
needing good air.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
getting sunlight.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And our body wants
to cleanse itself.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It's looking to cleanse itself.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to cleanse itself.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to do very much.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Just input gentle foods.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Be out in nature.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Your body will cleanse
itself very easily.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the weight
starts coming off,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:84%
people become so excited
they don't want to stop.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, starting
to add more and more foods back

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
in from healthy sources
that look like the foods

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.760 align:middle line:84%
they used to eat but
are actually more

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:90%
satisfying and more nutritive.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And they'll find that they can
live a life of not just being

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:84%
fit and trim, but actually
feeling how they've always

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.420 align:middle line:84%
wanted to feel in a
body that works properly

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.140 align:middle line:90%
and that stays healthy forever.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is very important.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
solutions here,

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and this is the best part.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten through the
things that are toxic

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
awareness about that.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about what to do.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
What are you-- how do you eat?

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start-- let's
break it down with the juicing.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Juicing is a really
great way for people to,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:10%
like we said, adding in juices
is a great way to start.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So we have a green
juice in the morning.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And that consists of
four things, kale,

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:90%
celery, cucumber, and apples.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite easy to get
in the farmer's market.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:84%
They have these beautiful,
organic veggies.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you pick that
up in the weekend,

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and then in the morning you
just have it in the crisper.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready to go.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And you throw it
through the juicer,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
short thing to do.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a couple
of minutes, and then--

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Now do you use the
pulp from the juice?

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you do a Vitamix?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you just do the juice?

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:43.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
different opinions.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the things to touch
on that-- people always say,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.160 align:middle line:84%
what juicer do I need, or
what juicer do I have to get.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And we always say, the
best juicer you've got

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.700 align:middle line:90%
is the one you've got.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.245 align:middle line:90%
And if you don't have a juicer--

00:40:53.245 --> 00:40:55.384 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
a juicer, get one.

00:40:55.384 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
want to get a juicer,

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:84%
there's so many juice
bars these days.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:84%
You can quickly find
one close to your house,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, for most people.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And if not, and
you've got a blender,

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
just put that all in the
blender and blend it up.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what we're
encouraging people to do

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:84%
is to get more greens
into their life.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.067 align:middle line:84%
And juicing is really powerful
because when you drink it,

00:41:13.067 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:84%
it goes straight into
your blood stream.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.666 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
difference between that

00:41:15.666 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and eating a salad?

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
No, it's nothing
much difference.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:10%
It's getting the nutrients.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.290 align:middle line:84%
The juice is really
a 15 minute--

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.935 align:middle line:84%
I call it the 15 minute
express nutrient cleanse.

00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:10%
So really, it goes into
your system straightaway,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and 15 minutes later you have
that in your blood system.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a salad
has to be digested,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:90%
and it will still get there.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:10%
But it's just less quick.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
The juicing for me is almost
like a blood transfusion.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the vitamins and
nutrients going into the body.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I experience that sometimes.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.070 align:middle line:84%
If I'll go and exercise
and have a juice,

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.035 align:middle line:90%
I can actually feel in my legs.

00:41:52.035 --> 00:41:53.220 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Just because I
think you really do

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:84%
break down the hull-- as they
were showing in the video

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:90%
there-- of the food.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the
actual nutrients.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.219 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:03.219 --> 00:42:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, our
body is a juicer.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:90%
We are a juice machine.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Our bod takes in food,
it crunches it all down

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.495 align:middle line:84%
in our mouth, and
then with the saliva,

00:42:13.495 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
it goes through our
digestive tract.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it has to
be liquefied in order

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:84%
for the nutrients to
go through the villi

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.287 align:middle line:84%
in the small intestine, in
the gut, into the bloodstream.

00:42:22.287 --> 00:42:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And then from when they're
in the bloodstream,

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
they go through-- so
juicing is just basically

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:84%
taking one of those
steps out and consuming

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:90%
the vegetable juice.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Now it's so powerful
because of how quickly

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:90%
it delivers those nutrients.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got a
beaten-up digestion system,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
or if you've got a gut
that's not working too well--

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.430 align:middle line:84%
you haven't had too many
probiotic rich foods.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So your digestion
is not 100%, then

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
juicing is powerful because
it just bypasses all that

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and goes straight
into the blood stream.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Does it have in the beginning
cause a detoxification

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:90%
effect at all in the body?

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It sure does.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, if they're not
used to the juicing, the juices

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
green juices, will

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:90%
allow things to start moving.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people need that.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.180 align:middle line:84%
We say, start with a glass of
water and then have the juice.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Things will start moving.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you add water to your juice?

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
No, we want to be
hydrated, as well.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Juicing and hydration
go hand in hand.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But really, what
we're talking about

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
is really trying to find those
things that people can add in.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And the most healthy
things people can add

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:84%
in-- and the
juicing, and salads,

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and green foods,
and plant foods--

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.465 align:middle line:90%
not seeds-- vegetables--

00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:29.270 align:middle line:90%
You can put those in?

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:84%
---seaweeds, sprouts.
Add it all in.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, not-- into your
diet is what I'm saying.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.740 align:middle line:90%
The concept of adding.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So add that juice once per day,
or add a great, green smoothie

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
once a day, or add a
salad with your lunch,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
or add a salad
before your dinner.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I can already hear
people's excuses.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't like
to use my juicer.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how to clean
it, it takes a lot of time,

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm too busy.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.950 align:middle line:10%
But it's really about
breaking it down for ourselves

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.460 align:middle line:10%
and making it easy and
simple, and being prepared.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.850 align:middle line:10%
If you have all those
veggies there in the weekend,

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:10%
they you'll know you will
use them during the week.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a good idea.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Go to a farmers' market.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the clip from the film,

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:84%
"Hungry for Change,"
about juicing.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So take some notes.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is important
for two main reasons.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.880 align:middle line:84%
People often say, well,
why don't we just eat it.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.300 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
question, first of all.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just eat it?
We don't.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
thing to address.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
most people don't

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:84%
consume enough raw
fruits and vegetables

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and spectrum of colors.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So that's number one.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, most
people are overfed,

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and they're undernourished.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so their digestive system is
beaten up over years and years

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of trying to digest,
extract the nutrients,

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and dispose of the waste
of the wrong kind of foods.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.930 align:middle line:90%

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is important as well,
because it's easy to absorb.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate fast food.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
People say, I want
a fast food diet.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Get juicing.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think the average
dinner will take anything

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.840 align:middle line:84%
from 4 to 16 hours to leave
the stomach-- and the body

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
try and digest it--
freshly extracted juice

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is the 15 minute, nutrient
express to health.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It goes into your stomach plus
15 minutes into your cells.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's be
fair, you will consume

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.770 align:middle line:84%
far more raw,
fresh, vegetables--

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the kind of vegetables you
wouldn't ordinarily eat.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Juice mixed with a
little bit of apple,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.990 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
pineapple, a bit of lime--

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:84%
you can jazz up some of these
juices so they taste divine.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.220 align:middle line:90%
So can you imagine?

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
You remove refined sugars,
refined fats, junky-type foods,

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:84%
all the wheat, the
breads, the man-made foods

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.180 align:middle line:90%
going into your body.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
overnight you

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:84%
replace it with
high-water content.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Pure high-water content,
organic-rich mineral,

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
vitamin-rich fuel, going into
every single cell of your body

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.980 align:middle line:84%
in the most easy to
digest and absorb form.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And with a spectrum of
colors, with everything

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:90%
the body requires.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
body's going to do?

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
reject this at all.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's going to look and
say, now I'm on board.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Now you're good to me,
let me shine for you.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you were to
say that the number one

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:84%
thing that people should
start with if they're

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.330 align:middle line:84%
realizing all this for the first
time, what would you say it is?

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I would say juicing.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:90%
I would say juicing.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy, right?

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Just for the quickest--
we're all addicted

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to instant gratification.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We want outcomes.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
drive-through burgers.

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have a
headache pills that

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:90%
promise five minute results.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we want
instant gratification.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Now if you want instant
gratification in the good way,

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's going
to support your body,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:90%
then start with a green juice.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have a green
juice once a day,

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and don't change
anything else, you will

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.010 align:middle line:90%
already see dramatic results.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And from there, build.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Start adding more great
foods, and you'll learn more.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You watch the film, see
other films, read books,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.900 align:middle line:84%
check out the
"Hungry for Change"

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:84%
books, start getting
some recipes.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And you'll just start to ease
your way into it in baby steps,

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.336 align:middle line:84%
and before you know it, you'll
be a gastronaut in no time.

00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:17.212 align:middle line:90%
A what?

00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:18.647 align:middle line:90%
A gastronaut.

00:47:18.647 --> 00:47:19.990 align:middle line:90%
A gastronaut.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Or somebody who's really great.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say as well, in
the "Hungry for Change" book,

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.780 align:middle line:90%
we actually have 100 recipes.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The best juices, the best
smoothies, the best salads,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.210 align:middle line:84%
soups, really quick
and simple easy

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.960 align:middle line:84%
ideas you can throw
together and make it very

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.064 align:middle line:90%
simple and breaking it down.

00:47:37.064 --> 00:47:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually show
one of the recipes in just

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:84%
a minute, but I want to ask
you, what are some tips that you

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:84%
have, so for the
advanced juicer-- what

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.270 align:middle line:84%
eating for beauty--
actually you don't even

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:90%
need to be advanced for this.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.710 align:middle line:84%
What types of foods can you
need for better eyesight?

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, better eyesight--
carrots, the number one thing.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Carrots are shown to increase
blood circulation to your eyes

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:90%
within 20 minutes.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Very high in vitamin A.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.554 align:middle line:84%
So there's also this law
of signatures in foods.

00:48:02.554 --> 00:48:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
you're aware of this,

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.240 align:middle line:84%
but if you look
at foods, and you

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.560 align:middle line:84%
look at the shape and the
construction of the food--

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.075 align:middle line:84%
if you cut a carrot down
this way, across the carrot,

00:48:11.075 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that it
looks like an eye.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:84%
If you look at broccoli,
it looks like the lungs.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a tomato, it's
got four chambers like a heart.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So these foods-- actually these
signatures in foods-- actually

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.690 align:middle line:84%
have a relationship
with our body.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way of looking at
it which is for visual people.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many foods
that can affect our beauty.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Skin, you're looking
at silica, arugula,

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:37.590 align:middle line:10%
you're looking also at
radishes, endives, olives

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.970 align:middle line:10%
and olive oil, cucumbers--

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:10%
---probiotic foods.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Foods that have been cultured
so they have all the probiotics

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:10%
that help us to digest
and help with the gut

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.350 align:middle line:10%
flora that are usually in
disrepair for a lot of people.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
What types of
foods have those--

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Sauerkraut.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.411 align:middle line:84%
Cultured vegetables like
kimchi and sauerkraut.

00:48:58.411 --> 00:49:00.050 align:middle line:84%
-Kefir?
-Also, kefir, yes.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And kombucha and yogurts.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So really helping to recolonize
the digestive system--

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
the effectiveness

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.660 align:middle line:84%
of the way that your
body assimilates

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and digests all the
nutrients from the foods

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:16.545 align:middle line:90%
increases dramatically.

00:49:16.545 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you get more nutrients,
your nourishing your body.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine was asking
this morning about this.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.740 align:middle line:84%
She was wondering,
should she get a flu

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.040 align:middle line:90%
shot for her child, or not.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
think along the lines

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.380 align:middle line:90%
of, well, I don't really know.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The nasal spray
flu shot-- there's

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:84%
a controversy of whether
or not that crosses

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.870 align:middle line:90%
the blood brain barrier or not.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And what type of advice
would you give her?

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say to stick
to natural things

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.010 align:middle line:84%
just so your body
can recognize them.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In the flu shot there's
a lot of items in there

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that our body does not
deal with very well,

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't recognize.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say, stick with things
that we know that our body

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.280 align:middle line:90%
knows how to deal with.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Even when I start
feeling a little bit ill,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.443 align:middle line:84%
I go for things that
are high in vitamin C.

00:50:02.443 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So chlorophyll-rich foods,
high in vitamin C foods,

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.270 align:middle line:84%
lots of water, mega doses
of vitamin C, even just

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.950 align:middle line:90%
the crystals, and then zinc.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think for a lot of people,
the best flu shot you can get

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:90%
is a green juice.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the more that you can
bolster your own immunity,

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the more that you can create
an environment in your body

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:90%
where you are immune.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Because of the strength
of your immune system,

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.330 align:middle line:90%
then you're in a powerful state.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I've got to ask
you about protein.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you get protein
into your diet?

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I think protein
is available in so

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.730 align:middle line:90%
many different types of foods.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We're just led to
believe that it

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.670 align:middle line:90%
only comes from animal sources.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are great sources
of animal protein as well.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Clean, wild-caught
fish, certain types

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.165 align:middle line:84%
of wild or grass-fed
animals for people who

00:50:47.165 --> 00:50:48.940 align:middle line:90%
chose to eat animal products.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But also in the
vegetarian realm,

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:84%
there's so many places you
can get great proteins.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Hemp seeds are a
fantastic example.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Even protein concentrates
from pea or soy.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So really making sure that
you look for the best quality.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever you're
eating seeds or nuts,

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:84%
they're fatty foods because
they have high fat content.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.335 align:middle line:84%
And fats tend to
accumulate toxins,

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
so you want to make sure
they're as organic as possible.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.091 align:middle line:84%
Now can you add a protein
powder to the green juice?

00:51:19.091 --> 00:51:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You can add it to
a green smoothie.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We usually add a
tablespoon of hemp powder.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Hemp powder.

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Hemp's one of my favorites
because it has the amino acids.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It has the building blocks
for the protein in the body.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I also, from David Wolfe,
learned about the hemp seed

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and about-- He has a
brown rice protein powder.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.170 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN:
Protein, exactly.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:90%
There are so many available.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:84%
There's whey protein that
are goat's milk protein.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can get also now whey
concentrate and grass fed whey,

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.825 align:middle line:90%
raw whey concentrate.

00:51:50.825 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can get higher
quality whey products now.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So really, when we're talking
about foods in this section

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.580 align:middle line:84%
here, it's about being--
one of my friend's term

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is actually called-- she's
a fantastic nutritionist.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And she calls it
a "qualitarian."

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about not
being a vegetarian or a vegan.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:06.870 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, interesting.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's more about quality.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So your primary
concern as a filter

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:84%
when you go shopping is not,
I can't have this, or has that

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:90%
got animal products.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It's more, what is the
best quality product

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I can be giving my body.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:20.451 align:middle line:84%
And if you choose to be more on
the vegetarian plant base side,

00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:21.150 align:middle line:90%
that's great.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Or if you choose to have
some animal products,

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that's great, too.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:24.857 align:middle line:84%
But make sure the
quality is high.

00:52:24.857 --> 00:52:26.490 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH: So
what are we looking for?

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people ask, well,
what types of meat are OK,

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.520 align:middle line:90%
or what types of dairy are OK.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:90%
We usually say, the grass fed.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So that means the cows have
been raised on pastures

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.520 align:middle line:90%
rather than locked up in cages.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're humanely treated.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.700 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot now.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Especially in a lot
of supermarkets,

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.445 align:middle line:84%
you can see a lot of
labeling is happening.

00:52:45.445 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.880 align:middle line:90%
You know what you're buying.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes that's good.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk
into a supermarket,

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.946 align:middle line:84%
what's the first
section that you go to?

00:52:52.946 --> 00:52:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just go
to farmers markets?

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.800 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH: That's
a good question, Lisa.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, we go to
supermarkets, too.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I want practicality, here.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.510 align:middle line:84%
We usually go
around the outside.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:03.360 align:middle line:84%
The perimeter is where
we shop because that's

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.390 align:middle line:90%
the most freshest.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know that those
people-- they come in and go,

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's the produce section.

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.080 align:middle line:84%
We usually steer clear
of the middle part,

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's got most
of the processed foods

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that our body
doesn't really know

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.030 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with and recognize.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
before, as well,

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the processed
foods and the E numbers-- when

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.190 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of
those foods, our body

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.160 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what to do with it.
So what does it do?

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It stores it as fat
because it doesn't know.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.010 align:middle line:84%
It will just be like,
we'll deal with that later.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big proponent
of child's lunch boxes.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.267 align:middle line:84%
Please put color
in the lunch box.

00:53:35.267 --> 00:53:36.300 align:middle line:90%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: Eat a rainbow.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It is challenging,
though, because you

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.280 align:middle line:84%
want to put stuff in there
that's going to last all day.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.646 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if the
box is going to sit

00:53:41.646 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:90%
outside or in a backpack.

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I always want to put
green food in that lunch box.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You got to stay
committed to it, moms.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:50.590 align:middle line:90%
You got to do that.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we have a recipe
that I want to show you.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:55.230 align:middle line:10%
We have just a picture
here of the recipe.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:10%
You can write this down.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:58.370 align:middle line:10%
You can start here
with your juicing.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.230 align:middle line:10%
You can take a look
at what's in it.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:10%
It's just celery,
cucumber, as you mentioned,

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.190 align:middle line:10%
a few kale leaves.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.020 align:middle line:10%
Those are leafy.

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.980 align:middle line:10%
They last for a long time.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.870 align:middle line:10%
Keep going.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.770 align:middle line:10%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: And there's
some parsley in there, which

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.730 align:middle line:10%
we talk about as really
powerful for detoxifying

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:13.940 align:middle line:10%
the bloodstream.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.870 align:middle line:10%
Then a lemon or lime.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:17.740 align:middle line:10%
I like to leave a little
bit of peel on there.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:10%
So take the ends off, maybe
just a little bit off the sides.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.490 align:middle line:10%
But leave a little
bit of the peel

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.674 align:middle line:10%
because it just
adds a nice tang.

00:54:22.674 --> 00:54:23.940 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you
notice the flavor.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Try it out.
It's really nice.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.180 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Interesting.
And very cleansing, too.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:26.650 align:middle line:10%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: And
a lot of the nutrients

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:10%
are in the pith, the
white substance there.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And a lot
of vitamins there, too.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:30.650 align:middle line:10%
That's good.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:31.583 align:middle line:10%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: Absolutely.

00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:34.300 align:middle line:10%
So then, for most people--
I can have it like that--

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.460 align:middle line:10%
but for most people, they want
a little bit of sweetness.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.410 align:middle line:10%
And the pear is really
great because it's

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.200 align:middle line:10%
a low-glycemic
sweetener, fruit sugar.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And/or an apple like a
green apple is really great.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.660 align:middle line:10%
So that alone, if you
lay that out in a bowl,

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.394 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't normally go
and attack that and eat it,

00:54:48.394 --> 00:54:50.240 align:middle line:10%
would you?
You wouldn't normally do that.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.100 align:middle line:10%
But if you juice it, you can
get all those nutrients right

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:10%
into your bloodstream.
That's why it's so powerful.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.490 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That
makes perfect sense.

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:58.170 align:middle line:10%
OK, so now where do we
find out about the film?

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.310 align:middle line:84%
People could show it
in their classrooms,

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:01.410 align:middle line:90%
their work environments.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.060 align:middle line:84%
We encourage free screenings
all around the world.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.640 align:middle line:90%
We encourage groups to do that.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.110 align:middle line:84%
You can find out about
"Hungry for Change."

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Filmmakers actually charge
for their films to be screened.

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So we just said, no, we
want people to see this.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.540 align:middle line:90%
We want it to be available.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And people all over the
world are screening it.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's in schools, and
in community centers,

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of wellness
centers, actually, as well.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.667 align:middle line:84%
And chiropractors, they're
playing it in waiting rooms.

00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:26.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Good, yeah.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of really, really
great information in there.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And the website,
hungryforchange.com?

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.360 align:middle line:90%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: Dot TV.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, hungryforchange.tv,
and foodmatters.tv.

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's also going
to be on Gaiam TV,

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:84%
so it's definitely going to be
on there for everyone as well.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:84%
You are just the
picture of health.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You have so much
great information.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all embedded into the DVDs
as well, and the book as well.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're really doing
a lot to help people

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and to help make a change.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.810 align:middle line:84%
JAMES COLQUHOUN: Thank
you so much, Lisa.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.370 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's great to
have you guys here.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And so, what's next?

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
make another one?

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.900 align:middle line:84%
We would love to
make another film.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Laurentine hates it when
I talk about other films.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.730 align:middle line:84%
She's like, not yet, we need
to get this one out there.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:08.430 align:middle line:90%
We will, of course.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to work on about
two or three other projects.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is like number
10 in iTunes, you said?

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's been really
successful on iTunes.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's coming on Netflix
soon, and obviously it'll

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.884 align:middle line:90%
be on Gaiam TV, gaiamtv.com.

00:56:19.884 --> 00:56:21.050 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: There's
a lot out there,

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.130 align:middle line:84%
so for you to be able to make
a mark with this type of film,

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:84%
it really makes
a big difference.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.987 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both so much
for joining us today.

00:56:25.987 --> 00:56:27.319 align:middle line:84%
LAURENTINE TEN BOSCH:
Thank you so much.

00:56:27.319 --> 00:56:28.370 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:30.520 align:middle line:84%
