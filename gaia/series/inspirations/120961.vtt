00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And the topic for the series
at the Celebrate Your Life

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Conference in
Phoenix, Arizona, is

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.775 align:middle line:90%
to explore the "I am" meaning.

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And in a book called
"I Am That," it says,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to know what you are,
find what you are not.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And my guest, Chris Grosso,
knows what he is not.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:90%
But he also knows what he is.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
He is an indie
spiritualist, and that

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
is the name of his first book.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And also, his second book
is called "Everything Mind."

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS GROSSO: Thank
you, Lisa, for having me.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Who wrote the
book, "I Am That"?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Ah, Nisargadatta,
a wonderful mystic saint

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.199 align:middle line:90%
from India.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So let's talk about it.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
To know what you are, you
need to know what you are not.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And you said, at one
point, I am not a preacher.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.945 align:middle line:90%
I am not a yogi.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:90%
I am not on the Himalayas.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I am-- finish that
sentence for me.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Mm.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
If I had to finish it, I would
say, I am loving awareness,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is the best thing I could say.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.986 align:middle line:84%
It gets tricky though,
because once you add anything

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
onto the "I am"
statement, if you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
speaking in the
"absolute" terms,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
it starts to negate what "I am"
actually means, because "I am"

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:90%
is simply I am.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an is-ness, a stillness,
with nothing else added to it.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But relative
reality is also part

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
of the equation, which is,
here we are right now, speaking

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
the physical.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So "I am" on the
absolute realm; I am.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Or I am loving awareness,
witnessing awareness.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Here right now, I am also Chris
Grosso speaking with Lisa Garr.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: There are two sides.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when the statement
came through, "I am,"

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that "I am" that we
hear in the Bible

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that we've read so
many times, and heard,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
is that basically saying,
I am everything that I am.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I would say so.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I love when Jesus says,
I and the Father are one.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I and the Father are one.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Ken Wilber, who wrote the
forward for "Everything Mind,"

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
has been a hugely influential
teacher in my own life.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
what he calls spirit

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
in action, which is spirit
constantly evolving and waking

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
up to and making itself
more available to itself

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
through its evolution.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So from matter, to body, to
mind, to soul, to spirit.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's all spirit
evolving, and again,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
becoming more
available to itself.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So in this moment,
literally everything

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
is imbued by spirit,
whether it's this glass,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:90%
the water, you, I, all things.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:90%
So spirit is in all things.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
All things are in spirit.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:90%
So I am that I am.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
This is a great way to
talk about your story,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
because you have truly evolved
from matter to enlightenment.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: It's still
a process, but yeah.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a process for all of us.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But talk a little bit
about your back story,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
about how you got
to this awareness of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and studying deeply
the spiritual texts.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.216 align:middle line:84%
So I share a story
that many people

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
have on the
spiritual path, which

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is it was drugs and alcohol that
essentially brought me to it.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I started out
just like anyone,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
experimenting as a teenager.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But for me, that
experimentation quickly

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
turned into regular
use, then abuse, then

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
full-blown addiction
around the age of 19.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I was also playing in bands and
touring around at this time.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.292 align:middle line:84%
So at all these various
shows in different states

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I was going to, there was always
different drugs available,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was always happy
to try these new drugs.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was a "functioning"
addict for a few years,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but it just spiraled out
of control until about 24,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:90%
when I entered my first detox.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And from there, that
was a good experience.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Because from detox
I went into rehab,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and I learned about the
brain science of addiction,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and that I wasn't insane.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I actually had this
disease of addiction.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.112 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't the
end of the story.

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's-- what
you do with that information is

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
the turning point.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back
to what you said,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
that you have a story
like many others.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That this is a culture
that exists and is growing.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's always existed.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
'60s, '70s, '80s,
'90s, before that.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So what do you believe
that is the reason why

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
this much experimentation
even begins?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.854 align:middle line:90%
Where does that start from?

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Boy, that
is a great question.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a deep one, yeah.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It is.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I only feel comfortable
answering it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
from my own experience,
because I can't tell you

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:90%
why other people do it.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you when
I began experimenting.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And to be totally
honest, I was just

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
into all sorts of weird
counterculture things.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I was enamored with David Lynch
movies, and Quentin Tarantino

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.399 align:middle line:84%
movies, and listening to
totally abstract bands.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And even if I named them now,
I'm sure most of your listeners

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't know.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But just all things
kind of strange.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.347 align:middle line:84%
And for me, an extension of
that was drugs and alcohol.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get into it right away.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I was "straight edge," which
is drug and alcohol free,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:90%
for 9th and 10th grade.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was in 11th
into 12th grade,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I just really started
experimenting deeper with said

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
weirdness and counterculture.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.036 align:middle line:84%
And not to say that all people
that are into that go the route

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of drugs and alcohol,
because they certainly don't.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was just,
again, an extension.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, it's
part of the psyche,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to experiment and to find the
boundaries and where you begin

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and-- so where were your
parents in this scene?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.396 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: They were there.

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in the
beginning, it really

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:90%
was just experimentation.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:90%
So there was no cause for alarm.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty good at hiding
it, for the most part, until I

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.646 align:middle line:90%
wasn't able to hide it anymore.

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.145 align:middle line:84%
And I think my parents would
say that they went through what

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other parents do, which
is a bit of denial at first.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
They knew I was
excessively doing things.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%
This is several years into it.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that they
wanted to completely accept it.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe they
didn't know what to do.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.141 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: That's also the case.

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
beginning, I experienced

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
what a lot of other
addicts experience,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
where their friends, family,
people that care about them,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.819 align:middle line:90%
just get angry.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they see that
they're harming themselves,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.068 align:middle line:84%
and they want them to stop,
but they don't understand

00:06:26.068 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
the disease model of addiction.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know my parents
didn't either at first.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So there were times where they
would just get upset with me

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Understandably,
because I'm their son,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want me
to go down that road.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And it pains me to this day
think about how many times

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
they had to see me strapped
down to an emergency room

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.827 align:middle line:84%
or in jail cells and
things of that nature.

00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But I am blessed, in the
sense that my parents did

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
take the time to educate
themselves over the years,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.314 align:middle line:84%
and now they understand
better what it is I live with.

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were there are other
addicts in your family?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I do understand
it's generational.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.667 align:middle line:90%
That is certainly part of it.

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting though,
because on my dad's side,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:90%
he grew up in foster care.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.315 align:middle line:84%
So we really don't know anything
about his side of the family,

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:08.330 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
My mom's side, there were
a few cases of alcoholism,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.049 align:middle line:90%
nothing that was rampant.

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But I have a brother who's
two years younger than I am,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and he never went
down that road.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.372 align:middle line:90%
Complete polar opposites.

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I think part of that
though is attributed to he

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:84%
saw what I went through,
and that scared him.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.846 align:middle line:84%
Scared him to not even
really start experimenting.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I think he could probably
count the amount of times

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:90%
he drank on one hand.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what type
of advice would you

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.029 align:middle line:84%
give someone who is in
the middle of that path?

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
With all your
experience and now that

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
you're on the other side
of it, what type of advice

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:90%
would you give them?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: That is in the
middle of addiction or abuse?

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
See, it's very hard to
actually give advice to someone

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
when they're in the
grips of addiction.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They're literally not
in their right brain.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Addicts resort to what's
called the old brain,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.152 align:middle line:90%
the reptilian brain.

00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're not working from
their conscious forebrain

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:90%
at that point anymore.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to
reason with an addict.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of people
have to hit a rock bottom.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say
that the rock bottom needs

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to be as rock bottom as mine was
or a lot of other people's are,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
because we can
raise that bottom.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's hard.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.165 align:middle line:90%
There's not a lot of advice.

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I can sit here and say-- if
you were in the middle of it,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.329 align:middle line:84%
I can ask you to please
take an honest look at what

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:90%
you're going through right now.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
But chances are, if
you're sitting there

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
addiction, no matter

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
what I say, your thoughts are
on, I need to get more drugs.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I need to get more alcohol.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's all you're
really focused on.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
It's a survival
instinct at that point.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I can't
hear you at all.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: No.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can hear
me, but literally,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
since you're in that
different brain,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
all you're concerned with
is drugs and alcohol.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It's life or death to
you, even to the point

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of addicts
will kill themselves.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But it is a life or death
mindset at that point.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was
the end for you?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
How did you absolutely
reach the rock bottom

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.829 align:middle line:90%
and turn it around for yourself?

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I've hit a number
of rock bottoms in my life,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and each time, it was as if the
bottom gave out, to be honest.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.469 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's
a daily reprieve.

00:09:10.469 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I need
to maintain every day.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I will never be a
"recovering addict" that says

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully recovered.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't believe, until
the day I die, that I am.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a disease that
I will live with.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm not taking
care of myself,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.965 align:middle line:84%
I always run the risk of
going back to that lifestyle.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But does
that allow you--

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
does that phrase or
statement or frame of mind

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
allow you to release the
shackles of being an addict,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.761 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I don't-- huh,
that's a great question.

00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are some people
that will strictly say,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I am an addict.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And I write about
this in my book.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very self
limiting, I believe,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:90%
to identify solely as that.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So I do have this
part of me that I

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
will live with for
the rest of my life,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and that just is the way it is.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I can never safely touch a drug
or a drink of alcohol, ever.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Correct.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.996 align:middle line:84%
But could you say,
I was an addict?

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: What I feel
more comfortable saying

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is I am a recovering addict,
or I am an addict in recovery.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
However, I only
really say that phrase

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:90%
if I'm at a formal step meeting.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.227 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I don't go out there
saying I'm this, I'm that.

00:10:13.227 --> 00:10:15.268 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- because like
we said in the beginning

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
of this interview,
I am that I am.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Simply, I am that I am.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to live with--
just like someone lives

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:90%
with diabetes or something else.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.272 align:middle line:84%
I have something I live with
that I need to be aware of

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and do my best to
take care of that.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.024 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that best is
through your spiritual path.

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely, it is.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
where you found it.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Where did you start?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
How did you first
get interested?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
What was the line for you
that-- the fishing line?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So my fishing line came in the
form of a professor in college.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So after my first time, at
24, through detox and rehab,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.539 align:middle line:84%
which I already
mentioned, I decided

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go to school.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go to school for
substance abuse counseling.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I enrolled,
and my professor also

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
happened to be my
academic adviser.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And she became a very motherly
figure to me and a woman

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I trusted.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Up to this point, I had no
interest in spirituality,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I don't
know, maybe about a year

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
or so into having
her as my professor.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a
breakup at the time.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And she saw I wasn't
in a good way.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.964 align:middle line:84%
So during one of our
academic advising sessions,

00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
she gave me a book called,
"The Power of Now,"

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:90%
by Eckhart Tolle.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.524 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I had some
grand, exciting story,

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:90%
but it was literally--

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, that's
how it happens.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And we're always students.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Always.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know I
still very much am.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So you started down
this journey, and what

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%
made the most sense to you?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.015 align:middle line:84%
Was it meditation, or
was it the introspection?

00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:51.101 align:middle line:84%
Or what made the
most sense to you?

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you couldn't just
go to the mountaintop.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.697 align:middle line:84%
You were interested in
counterculture music.

00:11:56.697 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You didn't want to
change that, right?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: No.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I always honor my heart.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And if my heart guided me to
lead that kind of lifestyle,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:90%
then I would honor that.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not attached to
anything in that sense.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
However, I still love
that kind of music,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't impact my
spiritual lifestyle whatsoever.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I found is actually
bringing spirituality

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
into all areas of my life, which
is what "Everything Mind" is

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.035 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just when I'm
formally sitting in meditation,

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:90%
or if I'm working with a mantra.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That, of course, is part of it.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But when I get up off that
cushion, I bring that with me,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and I try to cultivate
more moments of mindfulness

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:90%
throughout my day.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Even one breath is a meditation.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm able to
remember 10 times a day

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to, no matter what I'm
doing, just stop and take

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
a conscious breath, I'm
meditating 10 times a day,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
on top of sitting
once or twice a day.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your question, I
think the path of meditation,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.214 align:middle line:84%
for me, has been the biggest
learning to quiet the mind.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And not just quiet the mind,
but more than anything,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I've found meditation helps me
to show up today and live life

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
on life's terms,
for the most part.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.564 align:middle line:84%
Some days, of course,
are better than others.

00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But really, be peaceful with the
change that life is constantly.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:90%
It's always changing.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:90%
So to make peace with that.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to
take a look here at a video

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that Chris did, talking about
what he feels that spirituality

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:90%
should show up like.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I don't like hearing
people telling me that it's

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
this way, or it's that way.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and this is the right
way, and you're wrong.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Who is anyone to say that they
have the definitive truth?

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know that
I definitely don't.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
my style of writing

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.925 align:middle line:84%
is I certainly share
my experiences.

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty candid in them.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I share these so I can show
people some of my pitfalls,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in the hopes that maybe they can
avoid that in their own path.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I let them know what's
worked for me, what hasn't.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, I want

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
you to be your own spiritual
scientist, let's say.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Find out for
yourself-- I know this

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a contradictory
term, but experiment.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Find out what works for you.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I offer
practices in the back

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
of the book from various
wisdom traditions,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
from Buddhism or Hinduism,
even Christianity.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there's
wonderful, beautiful things

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:90%
in all of it.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But spirituality is
not just found there.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not just found
in yoga studios.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not just found on
meditation cushions,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
in churches, or sanghas.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
It can certainly be found
there, but it's all around us

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.458 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're on a skateboard,
or you're hiking in nature,

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
you play in a band,
or you're making love.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it's
always available to us.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have
a way of bringing

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the messages of ancient texts
and spiritual information

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to a culture of our youth,
of a great generation.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring
that information

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and meet people
where they're at?

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Something that anyone
who has read my books will know

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is I try to bring in some
pop culture references.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I find that is very
user-friendly way

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to meet people where they are
in today's fast-paced world.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll quote something
from, let's say, the Gita,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
but then I'll pull in a quote
from "Anchorman," a Will

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Ferrell movie, or a
concert I've gone to,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and tie in a spiritual
experience I've

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
had there, in places that
are not traditionally thought

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:90%
of as spiritual in nature.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring
it all to the path,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%
lay it all out on the table.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And I found that it's really
resonated with people.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, that's the
whole point of your message.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.295 align:middle line:84%
As you said, I'm not a
yogi from the Himalayas,

00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
or a preacher from
the pulpit, or a guru

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:90%
with a dollar sign in my eyes.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, as a result
of years of the drug use,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have been
to some dark places,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and that you're here to
help people see the light.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you have,
maybe a friend,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
who is maybe from the days where
you were using, and so forth,

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:90%
have they contacted you?

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Have people contacted
you from that?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And complete strangers.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I get messages,
literally, every day,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
whether people that are
just new into recovery,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.785 align:middle line:84%
or family members, if their
son or daughter is struggling.

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, always
getting contacted.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.955 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are you saying?

00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Well,
it's case by case.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's always-- I will
address wherever they're at

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and try to offer
guidance, whatever I can.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, it's
from people, maybe

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.939 align:middle line:84%
in a different country, the
other side of the country.

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But where do you start?

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
So where do you start?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's say it's someone
that is ready to get help.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
At that point, then it's OK.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
First thing is I
always recommend

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
people don't try to do it alone,
especially in the beginning.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:84%
If maybe you don't need to
go to detox, maybe you do.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
That's something that needs to
very seriously be considered,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:84%
because withdrawals,
if it's from alcohol

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
or benzodiazepines,
can kill someone.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I've had a seizure a few
times, and they are terrible.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, that's the worst
that's happened to me.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But often, you need
medical attention.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But from there, taking maybe
28 days and going into a rehab

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and really taking yourself out
of your life for a little bit,

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
so you can really focus and
get a bit of solid footing

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
underneath you,
some solid ground,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
so you can re-emerge into your
everyday life, but from a place

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
where you have more knowledge
about what you're living with.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You will have support
at that point.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%
You'll have guidance.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll know where to go when
you're back out into the world.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't advocate one kind
of recovery over another.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no shortage
of different paths.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
What I advocate or
what I stress is

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
find what works for
you and something

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.947 align:middle line:90%
that you can stick with.

00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you have
people coming out of rehab,

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and then they do
reiterate back into life,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and you were in that
situation as well,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
what is the first
thing that they

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
can start to do to start
to go on to that stair step

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
up towards growth,
enlightenment, awareness?

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.385 align:middle line:84%
Awareness, let's
start with that.

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
What's that first step?

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: First thing,
find a community

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.774 align:middle line:84%
of people that can support
you in your journey, whatever

00:18:10.774 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:90%
that community may be.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is a
medication group,

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
whether it is a yoga
class, whether it

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
is a 12-step fellowship.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's a combination
of some of those things.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But find people that will
support you on your path.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it alone.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
That was something
that I fell into.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm naturally
introverted, by nature.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.539 align:middle line:84%
And so I would start
to reach out a bit,

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
but then I would
gradually pull away.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.455 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of the reason
why I would always end up

00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
relapsing, is I'd be
isolating, and I was never

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%
a social drinker.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I would always end up drinking
in my apartment, by myself.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.943 align:middle line:84%
So by not having that support,
it just-- every time I

00:18:47.943 --> 00:18:49.032 align:middle line:90%
ended up going back out.

00:18:49.032 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And which
group did you associate

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
with in the beginning,
with community?

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: It was both-- for me,
most of it was both AA and NA.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Both of the fellowships, I found
there was a lot of great stuff.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I will say that
some people have

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.066 align:middle line:84%
a problem acknowledging
what the fellowship is

00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
you're involved with.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I personally don't.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time that people
come out of the recovery

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
closet, so to speak.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like the stigma
and the impact, it's just,

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
people have been hiding
behind fear of what

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:90%
others think for far too long.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:90%
So I have no issues saying that.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But also, so now,
today, I'm more involved

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in what's called
refuge recovery.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Buddhist take on
these 12-step traditions,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
founded by Noah Levine,
who's the author Dharma Punx.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great fellowship, but
I'll still go to an AA meeting,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and I will still--

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That sounds very cool.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit more about that.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: So essentially,
Noah started this

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
in the other fellowships

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
had an issue with
the "god" word.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not something I
have an issue with at all.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's not why I
went to Refuge Recovery.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But I really like that they're
taking a Buddhist approach

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:90%
to these 12 steps.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So it addresses more
of the suffering,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and the root cause of
suffering, and what

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of these underlying
issues that were bringing you

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:90%
to turn to drugs and alcohol.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
And I just love that approach.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I've been rooted
in that for a while.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've been talking
a lot about suffering

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and about what that
means, of going

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
from that place of darkness
and internal suffering

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:90%
to a place of lightness.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
What is your
perspective on that?

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you get out of that
deep place of suffering?

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's deep, yeah.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It is.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.379 align:middle line:84%
And again, for me, it had
to be a complete bottom.

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that's
how it is for everyone.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I had to just
have everything shattered.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why that was for me.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that as
I was going through that,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember stumbling across a
Ram Dass quote that helped me

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
significantly, in which
he says, "suffering

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:84%
is the sandpaper
of our incarnation.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:90%
It does its job of shaping us."

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.945 align:middle line:84%
And I read that,
and I was like, oh.

00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
not for nothing.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
There can be good
that comes from this.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so really, the
beautiful thing I found was

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:84%
it left me in such
a vulnerable place,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
where my ego was beat down,
the white flag was up,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:90%
my heart armor was shattered.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I was really finally able to go
into these raw and vulnerable

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
places and start sifting
through that wreckage of my past

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and working with these places
I was just scared to go to.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they're very
uncomfortable to work with.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And not just for
addicts, for anyone.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Anyone.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.286 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
to get on with life.

00:21:39.286 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do
now for a living?

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you teach for a living?

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:90%
I write books.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.496 align:middle line:84%
I speak at these
wonderful conferences,

00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:49.495 align:middle line:90%
like we're at right now.

00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you went
right to doing that?

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Pretty much.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Out of my last
treatment program,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
which was a little over
four years ago, I came home.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in my life,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I had to file for unemployment.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no job.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was an
addict for those years,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.589 align:middle line:84%
I was still able to hold down
a job, for the most part.

00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Or when I would have
to leave, you're

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
covered under, in my state,
a family medical act.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, so when I
came home, really, nothing.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
My car was repossessed
when I was in treatment.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I had lost my job.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that I
started doing in treatment,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
before I got home-- and I still
do to this day, every day--

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is I make the
intention or prayer

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
to help-- I say it
to, we'll say "God,"

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you care to call it.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But please help me
to lay myself aside,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
so that your will will
be done through me.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of cliche, but in
a very heart-centered way.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, please help me
to set myself aside,

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
so the greater good can come
through this vessel that

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is Chris Grosso, and be of
service in whatever way,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to however many
people you'd like.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.836 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
saying that, I

00:22:54.836 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
did not say it
with the intention

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of but I want to be
writing books and speaking.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.835 align:middle line:84%
If I had to be working at a
gas station or a janitor--

00:23:03.835 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
not that there's anything
wrong with those things--

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I was going to do
whatever my path was.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But I attribute that completely
to why I'm here today,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
is that aspiration.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you did back
yourself off and lay yourself

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
aside, what showed up?

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: The first thing I was
compelled, felt moved to do,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:90%
was I'd been journaling a lot.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I have for many years, but
particularly in this last rehab

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:90%
I was in.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I felt moved to start
writing or sharing a bit of it

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So I did with some websites that
accepted unsolicited material,

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and it really started
connecting with people.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And someone got a hold of that.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
I got introduced

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.630 align:middle line:90%
to my literary agent.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a
year and a half rehab

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:90%
that I signed a book deal.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it was--

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.092 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:23:54.092 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Very surreal.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.646 align:middle line:84%
Because I never went
to school for writing.

00:23:57.646 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, why I say,
I attribute it all to this.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.436 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This
underlying awareness.

00:24:01.436 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.845 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: This
witnessing awareness.

00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It's aware of all things that
are happening at all times,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and that goes back to
when we were a child.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that has never changed,

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the entire time, since we've
taken this birth and this time

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.430 align:middle line:84%
around, is this
witnessing awareness.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that is always present

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and never changing.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:84%
A constant state of
non-biased, unjudgmental--

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:90%
if that's even a word.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nonattachment.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Not attached.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Just a witnessing awareness.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So witnessing
our awareness

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:90%
from a detached place.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Not disconnected, but
we're not hooked by it.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Right.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just completely
unaffected by what's going on

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in this relative form level.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely-- again,
unbiased, just awareness.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Just witnessing what's going on.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said a
phrase to me that I

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:90%
adopted as one in my life now.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You said, what is the-- where
did you hear this first?

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So I heard it
first-- I don't know

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
if it's from them, but from
Noah Levine and Dharma Punx

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:90%
But "right now, it's like this."

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is the phrase.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.322 align:middle line:90%
Right now, it's like this.

00:25:16.322 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] There's so much--

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.523 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: For good or bad.

00:25:18.523 --> 00:25:19.792 align:middle line:90%
Right now, it's like this.

00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's like this.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just a total
place of acceptance.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.595 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you to
stay in the present moment,

00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:84%
to accept what is
in that moment.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, in that
moment, you can't change it.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You can change it in the moments
ahead or in the circumstances

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But for that moment,
if you accept it,

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
it will most likely change
in the moments ahead.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.635 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so much to be
said for accepting that phrase.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Right now, it's like this.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a huge fan of
that too, because it does.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.579 align:middle line:84%
When we bring acceptance
to whatever is happening,

00:25:56.579 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's not to say that-- if
we can do something about it,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.161 align:middle line:90%
we do something about it.

00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:90%
But we bring the acceptance.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that acceptance is
where the suffering leaves.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
We suffer because we don't
accept what's happened.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We suffer because no,
I don't want this.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:90%
We-- and it's that boundary.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Control it.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.903 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:12.903 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So by bringing acceptance to
right now, it's like this,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
then there's a spaciousness that
opens up around the situation.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that it's magically
perfect and life's beautiful.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But is it that much easier to
weather whatever life storm is

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.526 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:26:28.526 --> 00:26:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have
that tattooed here?

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.984 align:middle line:90%
That's a great--

00:26:30.984 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: [LAUGHS] I
don't have that line, no.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the only
things I probably don't have.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I like this,
is you've got hope.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Bookworm.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bookworm.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.393 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Loving kindness.

00:26:39.393 --> 00:26:40.824 align:middle line:90%
I have all sorts of--

00:26:40.824 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh, actually, yeah.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.652 align:middle line:90%
"God is," kind of like "I am."

00:26:44.652 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You say God is, and
you leave it at that.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Because anything after
that starts to negate.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So just "I am."

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:90%
God is.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautifully said.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.545 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
That was a beautiful
definition and an embodiment

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
of what the "I am" is.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Thank you.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks, Chris.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate you being here.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Thank
you for having me.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:84%
