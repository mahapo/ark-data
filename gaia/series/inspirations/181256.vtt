cost of health care in America,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
many are seeking alternatives
such as natural medicine,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:90%
acupuncture, and qigong.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Qigong originated
in China, and it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
has proven to be an effective
therapy of many ailments.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It has been practiced
for thousands of years

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:10%
through American presidents,
acupuncture into our validity

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:10%
for insurance,
which is incredible.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.827 align:middle line:10%
You've really, really made such
a big difference in our world.

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you could,
tell us a little bit

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:90%
about your background.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
As a child, what
sparked your interest?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOW: I grew up in
the household that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:10%
practiced Chinese medicine,
or the friends did.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And we played a very
important emphasis on food

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:10%
being the healthy
component of our lives.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And also, our attitude and
how we treat one another,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%
relationships, and everything--

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, emotionally,
physically, we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
are conscious about our
interaction with everybody.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:10%
And so I actually came
from China as a 3-year-old,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:10%
escaping the World
War II as a refugee.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't realize
how deeply that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:10%
was until I started
going through my life

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:10%
for this museum
that had chosen me

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:10%
to honor on traditional
Chinese medicine and qigong.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I escaped to Canada--

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Duncan, a little town near
Vancouver on Vancouver Island.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And I had my schooling there.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I had my nursing in Vancouver,
Vancouver General Hospital,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and also at the University
of British Columbia.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Then I came down to
Stanford as a nurse,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and I worked in research
and was very, very fortunate

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
in the research department
of the hospital in Stanford

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
in Palo Alto.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were first in the
research, as a nurse,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Shumway's mitral valve
operation, a heart operation.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%
This made history.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Kant's
kidney transplant.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:90%
That was in the 1960s.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And then we
also did morbid obesity,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
where we had them feed
on their own self.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
groundbreaking.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: So exciting.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And with that diet, I
introduced a substance called

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:10%
agar-agar, which is a seaweed.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- what was it?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:10%
A Petri dishes?

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And they are still using
it now for dietary things.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.675 align:middle line:10%
That's from 1960.

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:10%

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are, for certain--

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
so it was a thrill.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
And what else?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It was the first research in
DNA for tuberculosis and cancer.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So you see we're
the cutting edge.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so here, from
a refugee, and I

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
get the honor of
being consultant

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%

Health and Human Services

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%

System, or Chow Medical

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Qigong, which has healed
where all else have failed.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's so heartwarming
to be able to do this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:90%
with the help of God and Buddha.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I would love to know
how qigong helped

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
you do all these incredible
things in your life.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You've really
accomplished so much,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and it was through hard
work, and determination,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
the whole system.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a dichotomy in your
life where you had health here

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
but people weren't
doing great things.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It was always a lot of
integrity in your family, right?

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Absolutely-- the
greatest integrity, and truth,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and honesty.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And going back to those
days, I remember growing up

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that people would die early.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there was some cases
that my father said to--

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
my father was a
self-made lawyer,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and he helped a lot of the
Chinese come over from China,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and get established, and
acted as their banker,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and saved their money.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when single people
come over, men come over,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and no language of
the sort, they're

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.722 align:middle line:90%
open to gamble and to drinking.

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And get
taken advantage of.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.471 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: And taken advantage of.

00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:90%
My dad helped them.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't find out that he
helped them stay at our place

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
free until they got
settled, had a job.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.595 align:middle line:84%
And then we had somebody
else come into our house.

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how come
we have so many--

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
he says, well, they're all
cousins, when we asked.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, how come we have so many
cousins for years and years?

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we
must help our cousins.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And in Chinese,
everybody is our cousin.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm, yes.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Right?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see you were
taught that at an early age.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.228 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: We were taught early.

00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And we witnessed-- particularly
this one case I'll give

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
as an example, but
example of many--

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that Mr. Wong had no
diagnosis, but he was dying.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, he's
eminently dying.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So my father said, well,
can we use our medicine?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
That means our Chinese
medicine-- qigong, tai chi,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
acupuncture, moxa, and cupping,
and herbs, and diet, and all

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So we got the carte blanche.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So we had a whole
group of friends

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
who did different things, and
he lived for another 15 years.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
going into nursing,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was exposed to what
I chose as my life work.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was see the
revolving door concept--

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
they come in, they go out
not quite well, come back in,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.166 align:middle line:84%
they go out, and then
they end up dying early.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the Western
medicine system.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.123 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: In the Western medicine.

00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So as a nurse, I witnessed
this at Stanford,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
at a lot of the UC.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%

>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:54.281 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was a little
bit of both, right?

00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Exactly, yes.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
integrate it, otherwise,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll be pulled with the schism
and the chaoticness of it.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so pick a hero and
see, who's your hero?

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an unfriendly
competition, but a striving,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:90%
a hero you strive to be--

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A mentor.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: --and even better.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So in my students, if
I teach my students,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and they become
better than I am,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't keep secrets from them.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
teachers keep secrets

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.852 align:middle line:90%
so that they're the best.

00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've heard that, yes.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And I give them all of the info.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The first day,
they're doing things

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that the other teachers would
say, well, you don't do this

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:90%
until two and three years.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And so for
me, my philosophy

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is, if you are better
than me, then I've

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:90%
been the best teacher.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.873 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
wonderful philosophy.

00:08:47.873 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Yeah, that
has been so true.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really would love
to see you move the energy

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and do qigong, so we're going
to watch a demonstration here

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:90%
of Dr. Effie Chow doing qigong.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we are in
the Gaia Studio here

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
with Effie Chow and the
director of "Inspirations," Doug

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Moldawsky.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy to
have them both here.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So Doug is going to do a little
bit of an energy demonstration

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
with Effie, and Effie's
going to lead him through it.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Show us how energy flows.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: All right.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Now before we do
the exercises, I

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
want to explain the
use of the energy

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and how one can enhance it.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.492 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way,
Doug, I'm going

00:09:33.492 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how
you can lift me up.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.625 align:middle line:84%
There, put your
arms under my ribs.

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUG MOLDAWSKY:
Under the ribs.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Yes, and don't
crush my ribs, OK?

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: OK.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.513 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And just lift me
up, turn me right around,

00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:90%
and put me right back here.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: OK, here we go.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And we'll see
whether you can do it or not.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Was that easy?

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: Yeah, no.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It was easy, yes.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Now just
stay right there.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: OK.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Now I'm going
to do a qigong maneuver.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And now I want you to
do the same thing, OK?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: OK.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.065 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: The same
thing as what you did.

00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And so put your arm around.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put my hand
on his wrist, as I did before.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you
details so that you

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
can practice, but be sure
not to crush a person's rib.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a crushing exercise.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And so let's show what we
can do with the energy.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
When I say go, you try
to lift me, all right?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLDAWSKY: OK.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: [BREATHING SOUNDS]

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, go.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.566 align:middle line:90%
Now is there a difference?

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOLDAWSKY: Um, yeah,
you weigh 400 pounds now.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yeah.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's what I
was demonstrating,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can work the qi so
that you get more qi, and so not

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
only from the exercise, that
if you go work with a cancer

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
patient, or you work
with any other patients,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that you can accelerate
your qi so that you're more

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
effective and more powerful.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I have
increased, and I rooted myself

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, good job.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And Doug is a very strong guy.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.942 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: You're welcome.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.066 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you very much.

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Do you want to say the
difference you felt at all?

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOLDAWSKY: The
difference was that it just

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:84%
felt like you were
rooted to the ground.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I did.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Remember, I did this?

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:90%
The qi?

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And so my mind is exponentially
increasing the power of the qi,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I am moving it
down into the ground.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It is fascinating to see how
we can literally root ourselves

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.295 align:middle line:84%
to the ground by focusing
our mind with this practice.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me how the
principles of qigong

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
have worked in your life
and how you use that

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
as the basis for everything
that you do teach?

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Teach us a little about qigong.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Well, you
know something?

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I've had a very
diversified life.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy
that I live, and I

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
have to trust in my
intuition, and what I do

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and what I don't do, and your
relationship to individuals

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:90%
are extremely important.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
meeting strangers,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
you need to be able to assess
from an energetic standpoint

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
whether they're trustworthy,
whether they can become

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:90%
really good friends or not.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And also in working with a
client, a patient, a client,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:90%
you need to be intuitive.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just what
you learn in school--

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
diagnosis-- but you

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
need to be intuitive to
the individual as to what

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:90%
their needs are.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And it must always be spiritual,
emotional, and then physical.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
physical manifestation,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
they are signs and
symptoms of disruption

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
with a spiritual and
emotional balance.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And that's
what Western medicine

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.312 align:middle line:84%
labels that as something--
physical manifestations.

00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, so
they break it up.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you-- spiritual,
emotional, physical

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.822 align:middle line:84%
are all the same thing, which
is basically what qigong is.

00:13:29.822 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And you were
explaining this to me,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
about how when you do
qigong, you move the world.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Oh, yes.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's part of your
being with the world.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And in Taoism, in Chinese
medicine, and also qigong,

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the basis of
Chinese medicine,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:90%
the balance of this energy.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
saying that, oh, qigong, oh,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that's another exercise
and meditation.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It is your connection
with the universe.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It is your connection
with the life force.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't just
moving like this, OK?

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So even the movement--

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
moving like this looks good.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you move like
this, and your focus

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
is into the universe, and
your movement of the hand

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.802 align:middle line:90%
is moving the whole universe.

00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when you work
with the individual,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you're also moving
the individual,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation of the qi.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't just,
oh, OK, you know?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: So it takes your
whole mind, body, and spirit

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to integrate with
the individual.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And in qi, we're talking
about we are all energy,

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and so we are connected to
everything in the universe.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: And this is energy.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:90%
This is alive.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
In the Western sense, they
said this is inanimate

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and this is animate.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is animate.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you
have to relate to it.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And not just bugs, and
animals, and human being--

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:90%
everything is.

Because if you didn't have
oxygen, what would this be?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:90%

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:90%

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you bring their energy
back together again?

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: That's a great question.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
In Western medicine,
we have our downfall

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
now because we look at a part.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, kidney.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:90%
So we deal with the kidney.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Or you have a
gallbladder problem.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you deal with the
gallbladder or whatever else.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is a failure that is
happening with Western medicine

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.965 align:middle line:84%
because you cannot
isolate things together.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like quantum physics,
talking about the connection

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And that when you
look at a body,

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
it's all collection
to smaller particles.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you look at the smaller
particle, its connection

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
with smaller, until it's
ad infinitum, that it

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%
is all connections.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And Fritjof Capra has
written two good books.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.762 align:middle line:84%
"The Tao of Physics," and
that was way back in 1970s,

00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:28.306 align:middle line:84%
and it's still very
apropos theory.

00:16:28.306 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And the next one is--

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.425 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.187 align:middle line:84%
"The Turn Around" or
something like that.

00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "The Turn Around"?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But "The Tao of Physics" has to
do with the physics as a whole.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Yes, the
quantum physics relating

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%
with the Taoist physics.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, what
it is is that qigong

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of traditional
Chinese medicine.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.958 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I think that I
read a quote from you that

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
said, "When you eat
food with appreciation,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
it becomes fuel for your body.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat it
hastily, it becomes fat."

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yeah.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you eat
it with a spiritual sense,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes energy.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you just eat
it without concern

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
about what you're eating,
even if you eat good food,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
it turns into fat, more
likely, instead of energy.

a lot of us don't do.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:84%

Yes.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So we have to know.

And that's with
everything, not just food,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:90%
but your physical activity.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we strive to do
this and do this until we drop.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And we need to not do that.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
qigong is soft and gentle,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's very powerful,
more powerful than just

and all that.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Shin Lin, who
is with UC Irvine,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
researched fast-moving qigong
versus slow-moving qigong.

And in tai chi, they have this.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:90%
They have--

[SHOUTING]

But then there's a tai chi
movement that is very smooth.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I used to teach
tai chi, but I have

through Western science

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
found that the slow-moving

>>CHOW: Well, why?

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The logic is you have to
concentrate a whole lot more

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:90%
to move with a qi.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.832 align:middle line:84%
You move like this, it doesn't
take much concentration.

Yeah.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Then the other thing is, with
our movement, for example,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
we move like this, and
we pause and stretch.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that point when you're
stopped, the qi rises up.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%

taken 12 different systems.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%

I found out what was good in
this system, what was better

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:84%
in this system, and I took
the best from the system

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and I take a little bit.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I took the depth of the system.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw what was good
and what was not as strong.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%

to create my system.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
people are doing that.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The only caution
is a lot of people

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
are doing it without
having studied in-depth

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.172 align:middle line:90%
these systems that they take.

00:22:02.172 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:90%

glad that you said that.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%

really integrate these systems

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%

them in-depth.

saying it always takes years.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the individual.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
If they concentrate and say,
this three months, everything

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:90%
is yoga.

going to concentrate.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But mostly dabble, dabble,
dabble, so it takes years.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But we shouldn't relegate
ourselves to time space.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.089 align:middle line:84%

And so I want people
to understand that.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not the time.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
It is your diligence,
and your commitment,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and your desire to learn
in-depth the system.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them, dedicate
yourself three months

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to six months to really
dedicate to that system,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and you take whatever it is.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Then you look at another system.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Unless you have
the time and frame

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that you can take this system
and be able to separate them,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.012 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, take
this system, but don't mix it.

00:23:14.012 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand what
I'm talking about?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand perfectly.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.608 align:middle line:90%
I understand perfectly.

00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now you have an incredible

>>LISA: Tell me what that is.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOW: Well, it's dedicated
one day out of the year--

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:10%
the last Saturday in April--

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:10%

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:10%
in every country participating
on that day from 10 o'clock.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:10%
So from New Zealand through
the time span, it starts.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And so that in 24 hours,
you're enhancing qi.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:10%
It starts in New Zealand,
then the next time frame, then

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.084 align:middle line:10%
the next time frame.

00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:11.041 align:middle line:10%

events in their cities.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.951 align:middle line:10%

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:10%
on qigong, tai chi, TCM,
traditional Chinese medicine,

and natural healing.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
That expands it
more than qigong.

And so they bid to have it.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And last year, we
had it in Italy.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:10%
And so the purpose of that
is to bring them together.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:10%
As you know, as in
acupuncture, I've

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:10%
been very much involved
with the politics,

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:10%

>>LISA: So can you
explain a little bit

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.430 align:middle line:90%
further of what qigong is?

What are they doing?

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: It is a basis of
traditional Chinese medicine

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
theory, the balance
of the energy,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:90%
of the qi, the vital life force.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:90%
The qi is breath.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It's that simple, but
yet, that complex.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:90%
So the qi is breath.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.980 align:middle line:90%
And so that means oxygen, right?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have to breathe
to get oxygen. So you

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
have to learn how to breathe
with your diaphragm, not--

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] --this.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.852 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And so you have to
learn proper breathing-- there's

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
different ways of breathing--
so that you maximize

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:90%
the oxygenation in your body.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So maximizing oxygen will get
your blood circulation moving,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and your heart will
function better.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
circulation going,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the blood is what brings
oxygen to the cells.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:90%
So I use 300 trillion cells.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
When I went to school,
it was 60 trillion.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And then science said
it's 600 trillion

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.132 align:middle line:84%
because of the sophistication
of instrumentation and testing.

00:27:38.132 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great image.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: So I use half of that.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.927 align:middle line:84%
300 trillion babies
in your body.

00:27:44.927 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I teach people.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to feed them.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to cajole them.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to teach them.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To move them.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:90%
And move them and all that.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So qigong is really
a way of life.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just an
exercise and meditation.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, "qi"
is breath or oxygen.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
"Gong" means cultivation,
or manifestation,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.495 align:middle line:84%
or how to use it to
the greatest advantage.

00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can
understand how this

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:84%
would work with health,
because most disease is

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.920 align:middle line:90%
caused by stuck energy, right?

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Yes, and therefore,
lacking in oxygen.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And the newest
therapies right now--

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
just using cancer
as an example--

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:34.634 align:middle line:84%
is that they are injecting
oxygen into the cancer cells.

00:28:34.634 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wouldn't you
think they would grow?

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.434 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Well, it kills them.

00:28:39.434 --> 00:28:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It kills them?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Oxygen kills cancer.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And the disease don't like
oxygen, but they love sugar,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:84%
they love carbohydrates,
and they love no oxygen. Now

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the newest
therapies is injecting--

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because chemotherapy, it kills
good cells as well, even more

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:90%
readily than the cancer cells.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you get all
the side effects--

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:90%
horrendous.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And many people die
from side effects.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is what,
using qigong, we

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
have prevented side effects
from chemotherapy and radiation.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, we're
talking about the oxygen.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You inject it in, and you
don't get any side effect.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Now Germany is more premiere in
having this readily available.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
it's very hard to find.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you still do it.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes, we can still do it.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the other new
one is a stem cell,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
where you have cells
that are neutral,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's designated
to where you need it.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in qigong, I equate
that to the empty force.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We have, always,
energy around us

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:02.515 align:middle line:84%
that is not delegated,
relegated to a certain function.

00:30:02.515 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Well, it's
neutral force.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is for you to be able
to practice qigong so that you

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:90%
know how to utilize this.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I demonstrate it in the
push, and the lift, and all

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:90%
that, how we utilize that.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this outside
force is where--

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: We call it
the empty force.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The empty force.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Mm-hmm.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
utilize that force

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
when you lift people,
or push grown men over.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Well, heal people.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But I use this for demonstration
because people like

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to see something happening.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't stop there.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for six people,
and I can't push them.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I just confronted them.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And then using the qi,
and feeling their qi,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and building up my own
breath and my qigong,

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.202 align:middle line:84%
then I'm able to push
them across the stage.

00:30:55.202 --> 00:30:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually
have a video of this.

>>CHOW: So it's not fighting.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not fighting, I'm just

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:90%
that can be escalated.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:90%

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to push

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:90%

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Now you push, and
you confront, and you

deal with all your might,
and you can't get anywhere.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Not all the time, some time.

But we do, we go at it without
thinking, without feeling.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.995 align:middle line:90%
So now we use the qi.

00:31:54.995 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And so just stay.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:90%

>>CHOW: Well, it
isn't just breath.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, I teach people
to feel, sense where it is.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And I teach people how to brush
away the energy if they have

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.470 align:middle line:84%
too much, or pack in the energy
if they don't have enough,

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
if they're insufficient,
or the excess.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, I use
the meridian system

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to open up the meridian system.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I give them a toolbox
that they can use every day.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Simple tool box,
but it's so complex.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I present it to them
simply because I

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
went through many, many years of
research to come to my system.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we give them
a tool box so they can practice,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:90%

become more calm.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:84%

everything like that,

However, they
didn't give me food.

They just fed me
by IV and wouldn't

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:84%
let me move in fear that
I might have fibrillation,

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
which I'm clear I don't have,
in fear of my cholesterol level,

in fear of high blood
pressure, which all is normal.

My pulse is alright--

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything was normal.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.460 align:middle line:90%
But they kept me.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I understand medicine
because I'm a nurse,

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I worked at
integrating the food system.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they put me on three
series of drugs, of six drugs

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in each batch,
three antibiotics.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.380 align:middle line:84%

but they wanted to give me.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had terrible
reaction from it.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And I kept getting
worse and worse.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
After the third set, when I
complained of side reaction,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:90%
they would change it to this.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
further side reaction.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, by the third day, I

each one of them

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.550 align:middle line:84%

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: It was flabby,
and her belly got hard.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And also, then after one hour--

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:90%
and I teach people how to do it.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I taught her son
to work with it.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
literally push against

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.310 align:middle line:84%
while you're breathing,
and then push me out,

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.085 align:middle line:84%
so build the strength of the
thing with someone pushing you.

00:43:59.085 --> 00:44:01.359 align:middle line:84%
And so you develop
this power diaphragm.

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Strong diaphragm.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yeah, the abs, right?

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: And that's what she did.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow, it's tight.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Before, it was flabby.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's muscles there.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Her husband was
there, so I was teaching them.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Always family, work with family.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.312 align:middle line:90%
And so I have fun doing this.

00:44:17.312 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It looks
like you have fun.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:23.054 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Because we have results
that no one else is getting.

00:44:23.054 --> 00:44:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you clearly
have a mission to do this.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
mentioned that you

00:44:26.996 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
had affected the US president,
the ability to have insurance

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.155 align:middle line:90%
cover acupuncture.

00:44:33.155 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Well, it was a fallout.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't exactly that, but
because we had the commission.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:84%
We had, throughout the
United States, and in Canada,

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and other countries,
that most of them,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:84%
not everyone, most of
the medical schools

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:84%
incorporate an integrative
medicine, or energy medicine,

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:84%
or holistic medicine, whether
it's a class or a division.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: I had started
that, and then that

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.560 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of
the reimbursement order.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And I worked with the senators.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I go up to Sacramento and say,
OK, I've got two hours here,

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
then I got to go back down to
San Francisco and go to jail,

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.210 align:middle line:84%
because they were jailing
the acupuncturists,

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was helping the
acupuncturists get out of jail.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is why you
created this measure?

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: They were blamed that
they were practicing medicine

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:90%
without a license.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And they got a smart lawyer--

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Italian lawyer, not
a Chinese lawyer.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, they weren't
claiming to practice medicine

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.510 align:middle line:90%
with a license.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:84%
They were practicing
acupuncture.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So they got the case
thrown out of court.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: The acupuncturists,
two of them.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And then a well-known
homeopathist, he got arrested.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And remember, all this,
I was, at the same time,

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:84%
writing legislation
with the legislators,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:90%
having to go from Sacramento.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I just came from the jail.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I've got to go down to the jail.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It was like "Pirates of
Penzance" or something.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.790 align:middle line:90%
It was so fantastic.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the homeopathist also
got arrested, put into jail.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And they used the same
argument that they're

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.450 align:middle line:90%
practicing homeopathy.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've
affected policy,

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and you've helped us get
insurance to cover acupuncture

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, how can--

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Not as much
as we need to do.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I want
to ask you is, how can we

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:90%
affect health care?

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:90%
How can we make a difference?

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Well, the
power of the people

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is more powerful than the
power of the practitioners.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well-said.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Because if
we want legislation,

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and it talks about
finance, of course,

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.130 align:middle line:90%
we want finances, et cetera.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But the people is that
they want service so

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:90%
that it can be taken care of.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Right now, insurance only
covers medicine and surgery.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Basically.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it doesn't
cover alternative.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: There's a little
bit here and there,

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.410 align:middle line:90%
like the acupuncture.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They only give you so many
treatments a year, and also

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.240 align:middle line:90%
very little.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.072 align:middle line:90%
So they give the wrong idea.

00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You have this belief
that we should

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:29.244 align:middle line:84%
be able to cure what we
couldn't cure for $100,000,

00:47:29.244 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and you should be able to cure
for a few hundred dollars--

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For a
couple of sessions.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.553 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: --and for
a few sessions.

00:47:33.553 --> 00:47:34.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:34.353 --> 00:47:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So in a few hours, we really
can't accomplish much.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way that we can
get insurance companies

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to cover alternative therapies?

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.400 align:middle line:90%
It could be massage.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be qigong.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be tai chi.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It could be any types of these
incredible therapies that move

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.990 align:middle line:90%
the circulation in the body.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Well, you just
brought up a subject

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that I am very much
involved with right now.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Because coming back from
my near-death experience,

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that was one thing that
I was also primed to do.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a medical
system, and there's

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all the other traditions, but
it's so hectic and chaotic.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I am now,
with several groups, working

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:84%
at developing all
the alternatives

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.210 align:middle line:84%
into a structural
system so it has power.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm, explain.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.607 align:middle line:90%
What would that look like?

00:48:31.607 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Well, it would be
like the medical system,

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.230 align:middle line:84%
except dealing with all
these other methods.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As an entity.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: As an entity,
as solid structure.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have to write up
the tasks, and mission,

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and all that, and
identify what it is.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have several groups that
are very excited and involved.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And so then when
we have that structure,

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.652 align:middle line:90%
then we can build an insurance--

00:48:56.652 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
call it insurance--

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.240 align:middle line:90%
just reimbursement system.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Because insurance has
a bad name, in a way.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great point.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.743 align:middle line:90%
No, that's terrific.

00:49:03.743 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So as the medical system
has the Heart Association,

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:84%
it has endocrinology,
it has pediatrics,

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:84%
you would take
this, and you would

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.610 align:middle line:84%
use tai chi, or the
Chinese medicine

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.860 align:middle line:90%
system, and Ayurvedic system--

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Ayurveda, and Latino,
and Indians, and so forth.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: African, whatever.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And use all of
these into a system.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: All of these into a
system to get them organized.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they have a structure
to really have a speech

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.150 align:middle line:90%
that they can be heard.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.290 align:middle line:90%
So we need funding.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:41.610 align:middle line:84%
We need people like
you, more publicity,

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:43.290 align:middle line:84%
so more people will
know that we're

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:46.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to develop this
to benefit the people,

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:51.450 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get reimbursed
for practicing wellness classes

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:52.605 align:middle line:90%
and therapy.

00:49:52.605 --> 00:49:53.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:49:53.405 --> 00:49:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Wouldn't
that be wonderful?

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.555 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And that's
like in China.

00:49:56.555 --> 00:49:59.760 align:middle line:84%
In the old day of China,
they paid for their doctor

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.680 align:middle line:90%
if they kept them well.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But if they failed,
and they get sick,

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.940 align:middle line:90%
then they don't pay the doctor.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they get
rid of the doctor too

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and get another doctor
to keep them well.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Doctors still need
to make a living.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Of course.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because they
are really good people.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.105 align:middle line:90%
My father's a doctor.

00:50:20.105 --> 00:50:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Oh, sure, yes.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a nurse.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of the medical system.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you have these
different perspectives.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: It's just I
see the inequities.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, the danger of
complementary alternative

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.540 align:middle line:84%
medicine is what I
said, that people

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.340 align:middle line:84%
will take little
bits here and there,

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and then they go into practice.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're looking at too,

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.849 align:middle line:90%
is standards of practice.

00:50:42.849 --> 00:50:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And then, of
course, every practice

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.324 align:middle line:84%
will have their own
standard of practice,

00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:49.740 align:middle line:84%
but we need to
make sure that they

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.210 align:middle line:90%
have a standard of practice.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:52.293 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is important.

00:50:52.293 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And it's
ethical and courtesy.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's nice.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.200 align:middle line:90%
And having teams work on people.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Exactly.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it's
not just one modality.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.879 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Alternative and
integrative medicine,

00:51:02.879 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe, has always been
the way of the future,

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and you have been
such a pioneer to help

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.670 align:middle line:90%
us understand that in the West.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Thank you.

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I love being a pioneer.

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.850 align:middle line:90%
You are an amazing pioneer.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I just need to ask
you, on that level,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.760 align:middle line:84%
what is your biggest reason,
your biggest why, why

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.500 align:middle line:90%
you do everything you do?

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: That's hard to
pinpoint because life

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:90%
is such a broad issue.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose my answer is
that I have had a good life.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Even with the
challenges, I've always

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.200 align:middle line:84%
been taught that there's
something good that

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.190 align:middle line:90%
can come out of this.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
our bad experiences

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.770 align:middle line:84%
are learning experiences for
the people who are positive,

00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and they will get
benefits from it.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But if someone is
negative, they'll see this,

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.075 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go down,
and down, and down.

00:52:06.075 --> 00:52:10.320 align:middle line:84%
It has turned out
this way unendingly.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I concentrate on
the beauty of my life

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:90%
that has been.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, what
practicing qigong has

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:26.460 align:middle line:84%
been able to do for me,
to be a prowess in sports,

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:33.410 align:middle line:84%
in dance, and in love
and relationships.

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I like to share
this with the people who

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.110 align:middle line:90%
feel so hopeless.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, today,
there are so many people

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.720 align:middle line:90%
feeling hopeless.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: And I like to put out
one prescription, my signature

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.800 align:middle line:84%
prescription, is
that we need eight

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
hugs, heart-to-heart
hugs, every day, and more.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And we need three belly-aching
laughs a day at least.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.196 align:middle line:84%
And really not just
ha ha, but, ha!

00:53:05.196 --> 00:53:05.996 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:53:05.996 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Like Santa Claus, you know?

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that stokes
up the heart.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Laughter is the
sound of the heart.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need
a joke or anything.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:18.290 align:middle line:90%
It's to exercise your heart.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And your circulation will
distribute oxygen to your cells

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and help your mind as well.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer and dementia
is big, and that's

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
getting enough oxygen.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oxygen, laughter, hugs.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: Yes.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOW: And joy.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And joy.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: Peace, peace,
and all of that.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I hope to bring--

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you do.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.507 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOW: --for the
rest of my life.

00:53:42.507 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, thank you so much
for being such an inspiration.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.750 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOW: Well, I want to thank
you, because you folks at Gaia

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:10%
have been the inspiration,
as this program is called,

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.800 align:middle line:10%
"Inspiration," that you've been
an inspiration to where others

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.390 align:middle line:10%
have not been able to reach.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to be a
partner with you people.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, bring it on.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
spreading the message of qigong

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:09.170 align:middle line:84%
around the world and showing
us what it means to really have

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:90%
the ability to heal ourselves.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.830 align:middle line:90%
That's so important.

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:10%
And thank you so
much for watching.
