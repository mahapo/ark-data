00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.248 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.216 align:middle line:90%
Do you suffer from allergies?

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you live from one allergy
medication to the next?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.522 align:middle line:84%
Well my guest today,
Dr. Susanne Bennett,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.826 align:middle line:84%
says you can get rid of
your allergies naturally.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:29.663 align:middle line:84%
And she describes how in
her book "The 7-Day Allergy

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:30.764 align:middle line:90%
Makeover."

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.432 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:32.533 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.767 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. SUSANNE BENNETT:
Thank you so much, Lisa.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.002 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy I'm here.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:35.936 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, me, too.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It's a pleasure.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.272 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, you
make a bold statement.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.041 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that allergies
are just what you live with.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.943 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's
a seasonal change,

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:47.848 align:middle line:84%
your entire inner ecosystem
adapts, or doesn't.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.151 align:middle line:84%
That's a big change for people
to get rid of them completely.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.186 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.288 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that
allergies actually-- you

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.523 align:middle line:84%
can definitely
eliminate the symptoms.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.193 align:middle line:84%
And you can get to the core
issue, the root causes of it.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:84%
And once you address
that, you have

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.063 align:middle line:84%
no problems in
healing your body.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.631 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why do you
think allergies

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.166 align:middle line:90%
occur in the first place?

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.635 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You're asking me if
there's-- why there's so many

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.803 align:middle line:90%
allergies now?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.871 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.339 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: There's a lot
of different reasons.

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:15.175 align:middle line:84%
I find in my practice
it's because a lot of us

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.878 align:middle line:84%
are actually overloaded
with toxins, toxins

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.547 align:middle line:84%
from our environment,
the things that we eat.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.218 align:middle line:84%
We're eating the wrong foods,
the chemicals in our foods,

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:26.687 align:middle line:84%
the stresses we
have in our lives.

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:32.626 align:middle line:84%
We're so overloaded with over
working, a lot of kids stuff,

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:84%
emotional upsets, a lot
of different reasons.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.397 align:middle line:84%
And mainly, it's all
about your lifestyle.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.766 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
I wrote "The 7-Day Allergy

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.337 align:middle line:84%
Makeover," dealing with seven
different aspects of your life

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:48.441 align:middle line:84%
that we can get rid of
and heal by removing some

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:52.045 align:middle line:84%
of these toxins and addressing
and restoring your body.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:56.483 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So most of our
foods and things that we eat

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
have been around
for a long time.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:01.622 align:middle line:84%
It's just exacerbated in our
body because of the toxic load

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:05.592 align:middle line:84%
that we're under as of the
last maybe 25, 50 years.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.827 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That's right.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:10.163 align:middle line:84%
When I was born
in the early '60s,

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.733 align:middle line:84%
we never had issues
of allergies.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anyone who ever
carried an epi pen, which

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.074 align:middle line:84%
is the medical injectable device
to save your life in a sense,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.476 align:middle line:90%
to open up your airways.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:26.146 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember anyone having
Albuterol, the breathing

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.282 align:middle line:90%
formulas, when I was growing up.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:32.486 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, today, you know
a lot of individuals have it.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.855 align:middle line:84%
Allergies hit more
than 65 million people.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:38.492 align:middle line:84%
And that's the typical allergies
we talk about, like hay fever,

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.861 align:middle line:84%
itchy eyes, runny
nose, congestion.

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.763 align:middle line:84%
But I actually
address a lot more

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:44.463 align:middle line:90%
than just the obvious symptoms.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.499 align:middle line:84%
I really address
the hidden allergies

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.701 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with,
like joint pain,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:53.373 align:middle line:84%
headaches, acid reflux,
anxiety, insomnia.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.143 align:middle line:84%
These are symptoms that
people live with day to day,

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:58.278 align:middle line:84%
chronically, thinking
that, oh, it's just

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.646 align:middle line:90%
part of getting older.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.781 align:middle line:90%
I disagree.

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:02.549 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we can
definitely address them,

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.319 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it as an
allergy or sensitivity.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:84%
My definition of
allergy is much broader

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.756 align:middle line:90%
than what most people think.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So also,
most people just live

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
daily with the
over-the-counter medications.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.395 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, they do.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.464 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The
decongestants and the--

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.298 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Headache.

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.233 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --acid
reflux, and right.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.969 align:middle line:90%
And that's just a way of life.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.538 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Most people, because
that's how they've been-- they

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
thought that there was
nothing else to do.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.143 align:middle line:84%
This is the typical-- when it
comes to the medical realm,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.145 align:middle line:84%
well, if you don't feel
good, you go and get

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.847 align:middle line:90%
something to stop the symptom.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:38.151 align:middle line:84%
But my way of the
reality of health

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.487 align:middle line:84%
and how can we really feel
good for the rest of our lives

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.423 align:middle line:84%
is let's get to the
root of the issue.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to, why is it that
you're getting that headache,

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.795 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting something
to mask the symptom.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.197 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what we are doing.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.265 align:middle line:84%
Although yes, it does
get rid of that headache,

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:84%
but what are we really
going through day

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.104 align:middle line:84%
to day that might be
triggering that headache?

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%
It is that perfume that we're
putting all over our body?

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.876 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we're
driving down the freeway

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.912 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't clicked that
little button in our car that

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.914 align:middle line:84%
recirculates our
air, so we're sitting

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:12.919 align:middle line:84%
down all of the smog or the car
exhaust in front of our car,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.922 align:middle line:84%
that we are literally
breathing in every day?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.026 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we're
eating foods that

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
are riddled with toxins and
chemicals, that is causing harm

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.332 align:middle line:84%
to our body, causing
that headache?

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.034 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the
root cause of it.

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:29.169 align:middle line:84%
And so in my book, "The
7-Day Allergy Makeover,"

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.672 align:middle line:84%
I've addressed every
part of your life

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
that can contribute to
all of these symptoms.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What you're
really talking about

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:36.576 align:middle line:90%
here is your immune system.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It is.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.579 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, if these
various things trigger

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:44.084 align:middle line:84%
the immune system to constantly
be overactive, constantly

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:45.886 align:middle line:84%
be fighting and
fighting and fighting,

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:48.288 align:middle line:84%
is that what causes
the inflammation?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.424 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's one of
the factors that cause it.

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:52.225 align:middle line:84%
There's also just from
the fact that you're

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
overburdened by toxins.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.263 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
just loaded with it.

00:04:56.263 --> 00:05:01.201 align:middle line:84%
And our lymphatic systems
are overly congested.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Our liver is overly congested.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.207 align:middle line:84%
We are actually applying
toxins on our skin every day,

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.643 align:middle line:84%
whether it's we're
showering with chlorine

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.044 align:middle line:90%
and fluoride filled water--

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.048 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sunscreen.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:15.816 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: The sunscreens that
are actually-- some of them

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
are very, very high in toxins.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.021 align:middle line:84%
I talk about that in
chapter 6, day 6, which

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.989 align:middle line:90%
is all about your body and skin.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.892 align:middle line:84%
But yes, all of the things
that we're inundated with,

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.128 align:middle line:84%
it's really
difficult to control.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:31.965 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is, why don't we
at least control what we have,

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.135 align:middle line:84%
that we can do today at
our home, in our home,

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:36.737 align:middle line:90%
in our office, in our car?

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:37.738 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what we eat.

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:38.438 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: And what we eat.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.172 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, what we eat.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.944 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What makes you
so passionate about this?

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:46.546 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It started
many, many years ago.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.782 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a lot of
digestive issues growing up.

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:49.282 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aha.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:49.783 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:50.716 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Korea.

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
And in Korea we didn't
ever have dairy.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.189 align:middle line:84%
Korean food is really
all vegetables, rice--

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No wheat.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.557 align:middle line:90%
No bread.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:58.591 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: No, not really.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:05:59.693 align:middle line:90%
It was no breads.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:90%
It was just lots of veggies.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.831 align:middle line:84%
I remember climbing the
mountains with my grandma

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.934 align:middle line:84%
and picking all
the roots and herbs

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle line:84%
and using that as
our meals every day.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was fresh, fresh food.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Dairy was definitely
out of the question.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.612 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
moved to the States

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:23.115 align:middle line:84%
when I was 12 years old in 1975,
what a change in lifestyle.

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The hamburger
was introduced,

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.053 align:middle line:90%
the french fry, yes.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.088 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: All of that.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:28.989 align:middle line:90%
Donuts.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:29.923 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The standard
American diet.

00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:31.124 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The standard,
yes, exactly.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:90%
S-A-D. It was loaded.

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.427 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of cheese.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Monterrey,
where it's all Italian.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.331 align:middle line:90%
Sicilians live there.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.134 align:middle line:84%
And so the lasagnas, the
pizzas and the cheese.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.569 align:middle line:90%
That was all there.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.037 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
ended up eating.

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.439 align:middle line:84%
But it really created
a problem with my gut.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had that-- those typical
irritable bowel symptoms,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.247 align:middle line:84%
the diarrhea whenever I had a
cheese pizza, things like that.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.649 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of bloating, gas.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.519 align:middle line:84%
And at 13, I actually got
an ulcer in my stomach.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.088 align:middle line:84%
And that was all related
to the food I was eating

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.657 align:middle line:90%
and the stresses in my life.

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
So I realized early
on, something's

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:90%
going on with my gut.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went
to UCLA, I started

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.665 align:middle line:90%
discovering that, you know what?

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:15.168 align:middle line:84%
When I stop eating the dairy,
I feel a little better.

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've been dairy-free
for a very, very long time.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.207 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What type of response
does the body have to dairy?

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.375 align:middle line:90%
What causes the allergy?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.277 align:middle line:90%
And is it in most people?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.478 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:28.815 align:middle line:84%
Humans, by the time that
they're about five years old,

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:33.587 align:middle line:84%
it actually stops producing--
our gut lining, small intestine

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.689 align:middle line:84%
gut lining, the
brush borders stop

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.924 align:middle line:84%
producing an enzyme
called lactase.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.659 align:middle line:84%
You might have heard
of that enzyme, which

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.561 align:middle line:90%
is in a lot of the milks.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.597 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Lactaid
milk and things like that?

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:44.965 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes, OK.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:48.134 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And what that means
is that the milk, actually they

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
put the enzyme in
it so you don't

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.239 align:middle line:90%
have the digestive issues.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:55.976 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you
are post five years old,

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:59.012 align:middle line:84%
as we get older, we don't
have the ability to digest it.

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:02.115 align:middle line:84%
And that's called an
intolerance, an intolerance.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.985 align:middle line:84%
And some people, even though
you may an intolerance, meaning

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.786 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
enzyme to break it down,

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:10.023 align:middle line:84%
some people actually become
allergic to the dairy

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:13.293 align:middle line:84%
because there're proteins
in-- not just lactose, which

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.394 align:middle line:90%
is the sugar.

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:84%
There's proteins, whey
proteins and casein.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Casein.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.965 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Exactly.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.334 align:middle line:84%
And when we've got a
disruption in our gut

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.503 align:middle line:84%
because you're eating
foods that you're allergic,

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.672 align:middle line:84%
when you're drinking
a lot of tap water,

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.708 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of chemicals
in tap water such as chlorine,

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.177 align:middle line:90%
which is an antiseptic, right?

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:31.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:32.879 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Think about it.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.446 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
cleaning the water.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Exactly.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.348 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is it
going to do, but it's

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.951 align:middle line:84%
going to kill the
good bugs in our gut.

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:40.019 align:middle line:84%
And that will disrupt
and cause what's

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.621 align:middle line:84%
called inflammation
and leaky gut.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.025 align:middle line:84%
A leaky gut is
when the chemicals,

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.493 align:middle line:84%
the foods that
you're allergic to,

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.862 align:middle line:84%
will start to
create inflammation.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.665 align:middle line:84%
And your immunity is
actually reacting as well.

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:55.635 align:middle line:84%
And then there's gaps between
the cells that open up.

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:58.171 align:middle line:84%
And when there's gaps,
then undigested food

00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
goes through into
our bloodstream.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
boom, immune reactions

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.278 align:middle line:90%
and allergic reactions occur.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.513 align:middle line:90%
So you can have intolerances--

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.048 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because the
the immune system

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
is reacting to the
particles in the blood?

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.384 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.652 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And trying
to fight them off.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.154 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well,
they're recognizing

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:16.189 align:middle line:90%
it as-- not as nutrients.

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:18.224 align:middle line:84%
It's not vitamins,
it's not minerals.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It's foods that's undigested.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.062 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bigger molecule.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.897 align:middle line:84%
Remember the gaps we
just talked about.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Those bigger molecules
in your gut lining

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.368 align:middle line:90%
allow food to get in.

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.337 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
mean by leakiness.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a leaky gut or an
intestinal permeability.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.643 align:middle line:84%
They allow more food
than we really need to.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:38.478 align:middle line:84%
Not only though--
it's not just food.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You've got to think
about all the bugs

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.084 align:middle line:84%
that we've got in the gut,
bacterias, yeast, fungi,

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and molds and things like that,
as well as even parasites.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.222 align:middle line:84%
They can come into
our bloodstream,

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:84%
causing, again, more
inflammatory reactions.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.526 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you said that
the holes are caused--

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:56.296 align:middle line:84%
those permeabilities are
caused by what again?

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:58.498 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, when
we go ahead and eat

00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:00.633 align:middle line:84%
foods that are
toxic-- so we talked

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.836 align:middle line:84%
about the chlorine,
the chemicals,

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:05.005 align:middle line:84%
if we have a lot of
mercury fillings--

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
mercury is known--
they've done studies here.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.709 align:middle line:84%
Mercury in our fillings,
which are the silver fillings

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.978 align:middle line:84%
in our mouth, will
cause a disruption

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:14.781 align:middle line:84%
and cause inflammation
and irritation.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.549 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much
like-- remember

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:17.817 align:middle line:90%
I told you I had an ulcer?

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:18.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:19.319 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Similar to that.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:20.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Same thing.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.821 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's like
you've got inflammation,

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:24.024 align:middle line:84%
you've got irritations
in that lining.

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:29.329 align:middle line:84%
You're not capable of even
healing the gut, because you're

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.964 align:middle line:84%
not eating the
right foods, either.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating foods that
are like the standard American

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
diet, you're not getting the
right nutrients and vitamins,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.639 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants, greens,
fish oils and things

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.474 align:middle line:84%
like that, that
help heal the gut.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.643 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having that,
that's another reason.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:48.515 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there's also--
we take a lot of antibiotics.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:90%
We take a lot of antibiotics.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.184 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does that
cause it as well?

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:51.785 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, it does.

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:52.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:56.222 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Including
the non-steroidal

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:59.459 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatories,
like the ibuprofens,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:84%
the over-the-counter drugs
for joint pain and headaches.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.531 align:middle line:84%
We have a tendency
to have that, too.

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:07.867 align:middle line:84%
And if you have even just
two, three, sometimes

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:12.172 align:middle line:84%
four dosages of it, it'll start
the inflammatory reaction,

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.573 align:middle line:84%
and you'll start
to get leakiness.

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:16.376 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard if you
take too much aspirin, if you

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.144 align:middle line:84%
take too much of the
ibuprofen, you get--

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.613 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It can eat through the
stomach walls type of thing.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.748 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:23.116 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:25.752 align:middle line:84%
It can cause bleeding,
and, again, that leakiness.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want
you to take a look

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.355 align:middle line:84%
at the video here of
Dr. Suzanne's story.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.457 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:31.357 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.525 align:middle line:90%
-Hello everybody.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.462 align:middle line:84%
It's Doctor Suzanne Bennett,
natural allergy expert

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:38.264 align:middle line:84%
and the author of "The
7-Day Allergy Makeover,"

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:41.501 align:middle line:84%
a simple program to eliminate
allergies and restore

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:44.003 align:middle line:84%
vibrant health from
the inside out.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.639 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book specifically
for anyone suffering

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:50.143 align:middle line:84%
from obvious allergy symptoms,
things like runny nose,

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:54.147 align:middle line:84%
watery, itchy eyes, sneezing,
rashes, and even hives.

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.316 align:middle line:84%
But it's also for
those of you who

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:59.552 align:middle line:84%
have allergy symptoms
that are not so obvious,

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:04.524 align:middle line:84%
things like fatigue,
insomnia, joint pain, bloating

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.259 align:middle line:90%
and digestive issues.

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.795 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you've got
anxiety, lack of motivation,

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:11.865 align:middle line:90%
or have trouble concentrating.

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.801 align:middle line:84%
My definition of
allergy is much broader.

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.569 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that if
you're not operating

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.438 align:middle line:84%
at your optimal level
of health, and you're

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:20.473 align:middle line:84%
dealing with chronic
symptoms every day,

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:24.611 align:middle line:84%
then you have hidden
allergy symptoms.

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.547 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "The 7-Day Allergy
Makeover," number one,

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to give you an
easy-to-implement, step-by-step

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
action plan to discover the
root causes of your health

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.457 align:middle line:84%
issues, number two, to help
you eliminate the toxins

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:39.993 align:middle line:84%
and irritants that trigger
your allergy symptoms,

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.862 align:middle line:84%
and then of course number
three, to restore vibrant health

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:45.064 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.734 align:middle line:84%
I can help you get to the
bottom of what's going on,

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:52.038 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly, turn it
around, so you and your family

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.674 align:middle line:84%
can feel symptom-free,
full of energy,

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:84%
and get back to
enjoying life again.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.179 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe you've
got a child who's

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:02.348 align:middle line:84%
suffering from allergies
as my son Cody suffered.

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.484 align:middle line:84%
And you're at your
wit's end, desperately

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:06.152 align:middle line:90%
looking for an answer.

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.254 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you or
your loved one have

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
issues that aren't
so severe, but you'd

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.725 align:middle line:84%
like to find out
how to live without

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:84%
these annoying,
irritating symptoms,

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:19.399 align:middle line:84%
such as constant runny nose
and acid reflux, headaches,

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.935 align:middle line:90%
or unexplained fatigue.

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.403 align:middle line:84%
I know my plan
works, because I've

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.272 align:middle line:84%
helped thousands of patients
heal their allergies

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:29.342 align:middle line:84%
and regain their energy
and zest for life.

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:31.711 align:middle line:84%
I've helped everyone
from kids to parents

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:34.347 align:middle line:90%
to celebrities to CEOs.

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:38.184 align:middle line:84%
Simply put, I've condensed 24
years of clinical experience

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.286 align:middle line:84%
and put it into this
book to save you

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:44.424 align:middle line:84%
time, heartache, in your
own search for answers.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:48.294 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't know my
story, well, 19 years ago,

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.496 align:middle line:90%
I gave birth to my son Cody.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.666 align:middle line:84%
And what should have been
the happiest time of my life

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.035 align:middle line:90%
quickly became a nightmare.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:59.973 align:middle line:84%
At three months old, my baby
became plagued with allergies.

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:03.309 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean a simple
sneezing fit or rash

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.378 align:middle line:84%
here and there that
subsided in a day.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:08.047 align:middle line:84%
No, he developed
severe-- a whole range

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
of severe allergic
reactions, including

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.153 align:middle line:84%
hives and intense
rashes, mucousy stool,

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.956 align:middle line:84%
constant runny nose,
and terrible wheezing.

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.658 align:middle line:84%
And things only got
worse over time,

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:20.727 align:middle line:84%
that we had to carry
a medical injection

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:25.231 align:middle line:84%
to open up his airway during
emergencies and save his life.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.934 align:middle line:84%
We were so disappointed,
disappointed in the doctors,

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:29.702 align:middle line:84%
and I was so
disappointed in myself.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.538 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever we tried, we
just couldn't help our son.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:84%
I was so, so scared for Cody's
life and for his future.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.111 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't going to accept it.

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.847 align:middle line:84%
So I became 100%
committed so that we

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:42.948 align:middle line:84%
could find the root
cause of his illness.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:46.019 align:middle line:84%
I read endless scientific
studies and books

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:49.122 align:middle line:84%
and took post graduate
programs in allergies

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:53.326 align:middle line:84%
and environmental medicine and
contacted doctor after doctor

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:56.429 align:middle line:90%
in my search for the answers.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.131 align:middle line:84%
Finally, little
by little, I began

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.166 align:middle line:84%
to put the puzzle
pieces together.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about how the
food and water that we consume

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:84%
can trigger allergies and the
steps on how to heal them.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.443 align:middle line:84%
I learned about how to
keep an allergy-free home

00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and how to clean the
air that we breathe.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.349 align:middle line:84%
I put everything I
learned into practice.

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the time Cody was four
years old, he was allergy free,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.123 align:middle line:84%
and our nightmare
was finally over.

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:28.328 align:middle line:84%
What began as a mother's
desperate fight to save her son

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:31.297 align:middle line:84%
evolved into this
comprehensive program and book,

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:32.965 align:middle line:90%
"The 7-Day Allergy Makeover."

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.133 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.336 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so what is the
7-Day Allergy Makeover?

00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:37.337 align:middle line:90%
What does it consist of?

00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:38.771 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: 7-Day
Allergy Makeover

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.441 align:middle line:90%
was after taking care of my son.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.243 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even go into that
part, and that was really

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.012 align:middle line:90%
the reason why I wrote the book.

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That was
in the video, yes.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.416 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, and
my son was so ill.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.819 align:middle line:84%
And I really had to figure
out a way to help them.

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:55.088 align:middle line:84%
As a mother, I was desperate,
desperate to help him.

00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:57.523 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't want to see
your child in that much pain.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:59.325 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: No, not at
all, absolutely not.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.259 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.794 align:middle line:84%
It was scary, because
we didn't know

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.163 align:middle line:84%
if he was going to survive
this kind of allergy,

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.666 align:middle line:84%
these anaphylactic reactions,
being in the hospital.

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.334 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really difficult.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.104 align:middle line:84%
But what ended up happening was
with all the different studies

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:13.072 align:middle line:84%
that I went into,
and finding out

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that there are a lot of natural
remedies, natural strategies,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.748 align:middle line:84%
that we can do it at home,
for ourselves, with our food.

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I developed the
7_day Allergy Makeover.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:84%
So each day, seven days, we
deal with different aspects

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:28.788 align:middle line:90%
of our lifestyle.

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.357 align:middle line:84%
Number one, day one, is
all about your nutrition,

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.692 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to be eating.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:35.128 align:middle line:84%
And I teach all
the different foods

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:39.465 align:middle line:84%
that I ask people to eliminate
and what to add into your diet.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:42.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, the elimination-- no
dairy, as you said, no gluten--

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:43.236 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That's right.

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:44.036 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --no sugar.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:45.171 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: No sugar, yes.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.472 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you add in?

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:49.642 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, let's go ahead
a little bit further then.

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:52.178 align:middle line:90%
It's not just that-- no alcohol.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.847 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very difficult
thing that a lot of people

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:90%
cannot get rid of.

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.751 align:middle line:84%
The alcohol is one
of the factors that

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:01.554 align:middle line:84%
also causes that leaky gut
syndrome that we talked about.

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:02.054 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:02.755 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Why?

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.623 align:middle line:90%
Because it is a microtoxin.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The fermentation of
sugar and yeast and mold

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.563 align:middle line:84%
all together, it
creates a microtoxin,

00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:13.366 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually a
byproduct of the fermentation.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.333 align:middle line:90%
That's alcohol.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.269 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's wine,
beer, all alcohol.

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, yes.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.171 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, let
me write this down.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.474 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, and
so is also fungal.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.179 align:middle line:84%
Fungal-contaminated
foods-- that's

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:28.381 align:middle line:84%
a very difficult thing
to understand, too.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.417 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't realize that
the fresh fruits and vegetables

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have, if we don't
wash them carefully,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.955 align:middle line:84%
and if we end up eating
a lot of salads--

00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.491 align:middle line:84%
we love salads in
America, and we eat it

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.792 align:middle line:90%
at all the restaurants.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.662 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know, these
restaurants do not clean it.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:43.796 align:middle line:90%
They don't wash it.

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.164 align:middle line:84%
They take it out
of that bag that

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:48.434 align:middle line:84%
says it's three times
washed, but often it's

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:51.571 align:middle line:84%
still contaminated with
bacterias and fungi.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.374 align:middle line:84%
The fungi can also make a major
disruption in the gut as well.

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:57.276 align:middle line:90%
So that causes more allergies.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:84%
You probably heard
about mold allergies.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:03.115 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've got mold allergies
from the home and inhalant.

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not just smelling it.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.319 align:middle line:84%
It's eating it that
can be a problem.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.955 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course--
cheese is mold, right?

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:10.022 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Oc courses.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.658 align:middle line:84%
Most of us like cut
all the outside, right?

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:14.393 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll just
eat the middle of it.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:17.563 align:middle line:84%
But definitely there's
a lot of fungus there.

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:21.133 align:middle line:84%
And how about a basket of, let's
say, strawberries or berries.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:24.504 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to find one
where you don't see mold in it.

00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:26.072 align:middle line:84%
And we have a tendency
to be like, OK.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the body doesn't
adapt to any of that?

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.909 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been around
for hundreds and thousands

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.078 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Good
point, good point.

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about the
toxins, again, that we ingest

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:84%
and the water that we drink and
all the chemicals and the drugs

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:42.889 align:middle line:84%
that we take, and we disrupt
the gut lining, then the acid

00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed to
have in our upper stomach--

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.594 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to have
the high level of acid

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:51.264 align:middle line:84%
when we're eating these
foods which will kill it.

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.532 align:middle line:90%
We don't have it.

00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:55.835 align:middle line:84%
We end up disrupting those
cells that produce this acid,

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:58.971 align:middle line:84%
and we have what is
called hypochlorhydia.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.706 align:middle line:84%
It's a condition that
many people end up

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:05.177 align:middle line:84%
having because we end up
causing harm to our gut lining.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we don't
even know that.

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:09.081 align:middle line:84%
So this is all contributing
to inflammation,

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.416 align:middle line:90%
is basically what you're saying.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:10.983 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:11.884 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, day two.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:12.418 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even
gotten to day two.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:13.019 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: I know.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.786 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.855 align:middle line:90%
Day two is all about your water.

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:18.558 align:middle line:84%
I discuss a lot about
water, the water

00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:21.794 align:middle line:84%
that we drink, the water
that we actually wash our--

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:23.329 align:middle line:90%
and bathe with.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of chemicals,
especially tap water.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.502 align:middle line:84%
When I grew up in Korea,
we had to boil our water

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.437 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that all
the bugs were gone.

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.706 align:middle line:84%
But in America, we
don't do that at all,

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.975 align:middle line:84%
because we believe
that it's clean.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.209 align:middle line:90%
It is not clean.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.613 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to really look
at what is in your water.

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
There is, in every city,
there's actually a water report.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.784 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:45.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.688 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the water reports
with the cryptosporidium.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.488 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Arsenic.

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.189 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Arsenic in it, yeah.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.257 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Uranium.

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really amazing.

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:53.893 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you drink?

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:55.628 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I drink
purified water.

00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:56.228 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Purified.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:56.862 align:middle line:90%
It is reverse osmosis?

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:57.863 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:90%
It is reverse osmosis.

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.167 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it alkaline?

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:04.804 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I believe
that alkaline water is great.

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:08.774 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I just drink
pure water, reverse osmosis

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
water, is this-- I
believe to increase

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.549 align:middle line:84%
your alkalinity in your body
is by eating more vegetables.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.551 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables have a
lot of minerals,

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:22.088 align:middle line:84%
and minerals is what keeps
our body more alkaline.

00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:25.324 align:middle line:84%
So to me, pH difference
is not the same

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:27.693 align:middle line:84%
as having high
alkalinity in your body.

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.495 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now what about
the reverse osmosis,

00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:31.297 align:middle line:90%
where it takes the minerals out?

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- oh, you put them
back in with the vegetables.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:36.969 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, if you eat
plenty of vegetables, nuts,

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.804 align:middle line:84%
and seeds, the healthy
nuts and seeds,

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:84%
the one that's not
loaded with fungus,

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.008 align:middle line:90%
like peanuts and cashews--

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:43.042 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The dry roasted.

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, exactly.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.213 align:middle line:84%
If you eat these foods
that are whole foods,

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:48.714 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
all the minerals

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:51.684 align:middle line:84%
that you need to keep
yourself more alkaline.

00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:55.221 align:middle line:84%
Now, everyone-- a lot of my
patients come and say, well,

00:20:55.221 --> 00:20:57.623 align:middle line:84%
RO water or distilled
water is dead water.

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:59.258 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever heard that.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.493 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:01.894 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yeah, because there's
no frequency or vibration

00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:03.095 align:middle line:90%
because there's no minerals.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
it is lacking minerals.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.534 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to realize
that the majority of the world

00:21:08.534 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
actually drink distilled
water in a sense,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.139 align:middle line:90%
because that's rainwater.

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:16.142 align:middle line:84%
Rainwater is distillation,
natural distillation,

00:21:16.142 --> 00:21:19.412 align:middle line:84%
and it is vaporization
of water into the clouds.

00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:21.147 align:middle line:90%
And then boom, we get rain.

00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:22.882 align:middle line:90%
That is actually pure water.

00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:25.418 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I would rather choose
the minerals that I put back

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:27.687 align:middle line:84%
into the water rather than
get them from the source.

00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:29.755 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know if
they're micro available,

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:32.191 align:middle line:84%
if they have any types
of bacteria in them.

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather choose the
source, which vegetables

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.329 align:middle line:90%
is a great way of doing that.

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:37.363 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought of that.

00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:39.165 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You've got
to also remember that

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.033 align:middle line:84%
when it's not reverse
osmosis, and let's say

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.068 align:middle line:90%
it's carbon filtered.

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:43.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:45.504 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: We've got carbon
filters in our refrigerator.

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:47.807 align:middle line:84%
We've got carbon filters--
it's just a charcoal carbon

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.509 align:middle line:84%
filter-- coming from
let's say our tap water.

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:51.811 align:middle line:90%
You can get that.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.648 align:middle line:84%
And then there's certain
bottling companies

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:59.852 align:middle line:84%
that are fresh, spring waters
that are carbon filters.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:84%
But if those spring
waters come from water

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:06.525 align:middle line:84%
such as up in Arrowhead or
in the Colorado mountains,

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:10.262 align:middle line:84%
where there's a lot of
granite, natural granite,

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:13.232 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get arsenic
and uranium in minute amounts.

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.434 align:middle line:90%
Still, because it's in granite?

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.436 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, granite,
just natural granite.

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:20.606 align:middle line:84%
In California, we get our water
from the California aqueduct.

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:22.074 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Colorado mainly.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.111 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: We have a lot
of arsenic and uranium.

00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:26.112 align:middle line:90%
You will see that.

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:27.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, I saw
that in the report.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:27.913 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, exactly.

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.048 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's not added.

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:30.182 align:middle line:90%
It's naturally occurring.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.717 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Oh, it's
naturally because

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.786 align:middle line:90%
of the granite in basic earth.

00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:35.621 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then could
it be harmful, though?

00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:36.789 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Sure.

00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:39.759 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot of water,
you have an accumulation

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:90%
of arsenic and uranium.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:42.628 align:middle line:90%
Think about uranium.

00:22:42.628 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:84%
It is definitely can be
nuclear waste, right?

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:90%
Like in Fukushima--

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a heavy metal.

00:22:47.633 --> 00:22:48.834 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, it is.

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:52.271 align:middle line:84%
It is a nuclear byproduct,
a waste product.

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:55.541 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have that little
by little in your body,

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.677 align:middle line:84%
and you might have an issue
with your liver or your kidneys,

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.913 align:middle line:84%
and you're not able
to filter it out--

00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:03.048 align:middle line:90%
because our cells can do that.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.451 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have the
ability, whether it's

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:08.687 align:middle line:84%
a genomic issue,
immune system issue,

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.557 align:middle line:84%
you've got kidney
disease, you've

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
got fatty liver, whatever
it is, and you're not

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
able to eliminate it, then those
toxins are going to accumulate.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.368 align:middle line:84%
And that toxic burden, and the
overload of the body burden

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:26.172 align:middle line:84%
is what also is one of the
causes of allergies, too.

00:23:26.172 --> 00:23:28.574 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all these
things happening all at once.

00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.276 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
talking about not only

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
environmental allergies
or weather allergies,

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
food allergies,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.781 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of allergic
reactions that

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:36.982 align:middle line:90%
cause inflammation in the body.

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:37.516 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:38.484 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right,
so I mean, the water

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:40.352 align:middle line:84%
topic we could talk
about for hours.

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:41.387 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That's right.

00:23:41.387 --> 00:23:42.588 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just because
our whole body is, what?

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:43.789 align:middle line:90%
70% water?

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: 70% water.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.958 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our eyes are 90% water.

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:46.458 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, yes.

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:47.359 align:middle line:90%
Our blood, too.

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.061 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very high.

00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:52.498 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that water is
one of the ways-- actually,

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:54.033 align:middle line:84%
did you know that
if you drank water,

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:57.236 align:middle line:84%
and a good amount of water,
you can reduce your allergies

00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:58.671 align:middle line:84%
if you're having
an allergy attack?

00:23:58.671 --> 00:23:59.305 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:00.272 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is it
half your body weight?

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:03.609 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's
actually in ounces, yes.

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:05.611 align:middle line:90%
So let's say you're 150 pounds.

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:08.013 align:middle line:84%
If you're 150 pounds,
you drink half

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:11.317 align:middle line:84%
of your body weight, which
is 75 ounces in water.

00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:13.352 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're in a hot
day, like right now, it's

00:24:13.352 --> 00:24:15.354 align:middle line:84%
so hot here in
Southern California,

00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:16.555 align:middle line:90%
you've got to drink more.

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:18.691 align:middle line:84%
And if you're an athlete,
then you definitely

00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:20.793 align:middle line:84%
want to drink at least
20 to 24 ounces more.

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: If you sweat.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.028 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, day three and
four basically is

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.365 align:middle line:84%
combined with
indoor living area.

00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:27.399 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, yes.

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:30.269 align:middle line:84%
Day three is all about
your quality of air

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:32.471 align:middle line:84%
and how to clean it
and what you want

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:90%
to do inside your environment.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:39.645 align:middle line:84%
90% of our lives are

>>LISA: 90%?

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:41.747 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:43.315 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Americans spend--
that's the studies showing.

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot hours.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.484 align:middle line:84%

So we've got to make sure the
air that we breathe indoors

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
is clean.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.893 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
remember that we also

00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:56.328 align:middle line:84%
live with a lot of furniture,
beautiful furniture.

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.097 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of chemicals that

00:24:58.097 --> 00:25:02.401 align:middle line:84%
can out-gas from textiles of
different types of furniture

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:05.271 align:middle line:84%
if you've got flooring or
carpeting and all that.

00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:07.673 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
get a HEPA filter.

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.575 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
types of filtrations

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:11.176 align:middle line:90%
that you want to put.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.279 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that your
air purifier has

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:84%
HEPA, which is to
take out all the dust,

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:84%
molds, particulates, but
the carbon filtration

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:22.388 align:middle line:84%
to absorb the chemicals
that I'm talking

00:25:22.388 --> 00:25:24.623 align:middle line:84%
about that comes
from furniture, which

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:27.927 align:middle line:84%
is called volatile
organic compounds, VOCs.

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.528 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:31.864 align:middle line:84%
All right, so day four
is combined with this?

00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:33.999 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yeah, well day
four is about the living.

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.834 align:middle line:84%
So day three is
all about the air.

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:38.637 align:middle line:84%
And then what is going on
in the living environment?

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.539 align:middle line:84%
So we talked a little
bit about the furniture,

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.307 align:middle line:90%
but your bedroom--

00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:42.274 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Carpet.

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:44.109 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes,
but in the bedroom,

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:84%
we got to make sure that
we have dust mite covers.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.415 align:middle line:90%
How old is your pillow?

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.649 align:middle line:90%
How old is your mattress?

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:55.154 align:middle line:84%
Do you sleep with your
little pet in the bedroom?

00:25:55.154 --> 00:25:56.555 align:middle line:90%
And those types of things.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:26:00.626 align:middle line:84%
And for children, I have a whole
section for children's room.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:02.428 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot
stuffed animals

00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:06.565 align:middle line:84%
on the children's bed, that
can promote more allergies,

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.901 align:middle line:84%
inhalant allergies
and things like that.

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:11.937 align:middle line:90%
OK, so day five.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Day five is
all about your kitchen.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.409 align:middle line:84%
And the kitchen is probably
where a lot of people

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
forget that you can have a
lot of toxins and allergens.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.549 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, I
clean it all the time.

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:25.451 align:middle line:84%
But what are you
cleaning it with?

00:26:25.451 --> 00:26:28.253 align:middle line:84%
Could it be it's a lot of
detergent and chemicals?

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.856 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals with
chlorine bleach and things

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
like that, ammonia products,
that's a lot of toxins.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, that can create
a problem with your gut.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.633 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend people to use a
half white vinegar, distilled

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.103 align:middle line:84%
white vinegar, with
water combination.

00:26:44.103 --> 00:26:46.005 align:middle line:84%
And you can clean your
counters that way.

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:46.905 align:middle line:84%
You can clean your
refrigerators.

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:47.539 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it get
rid of bacteria?

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, they do.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.608 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
You can even do it in your
showers and things like that.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.213 align:middle line:84%
But I recommend you
clean it properly.

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:56.849 align:middle line:84%
And then, what are we
cooking our food with?

00:26:56.849 --> 00:26:59.852 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talked
about my son's story,

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:04.857 align:middle line:84%
where his first problem was an
eczema patch under his chin.

00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:07.159 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
that it actually

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:10.496 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the
heavy metals, nickel,

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:13.032 align:middle line:84%
in the stainless
steel pots and pans.

00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:15.234 align:middle line:84%
I shaved his head off
and got rid of-- I

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
took all his hair,
sent it away, looked

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:84%
at all the metals in
his hair analysis.

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.974 align:middle line:90%
At six months old we did this.

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.842 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there
was a lot of nickel.

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.878 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, where is
this child getting nickel?

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:26.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You know,
he's only six months old.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:84%
But that's when I
started feeding him

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.786 align:middle line:84%
food with a stainless
steel spoon.

00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:36.522 align:middle line:84%
Stainless steel is an alloy,
and there's nickel in it.

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:37.656 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.792 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Stainless steel
pots and pans, you know.

00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So we were using
all kinds of that.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I changed
my pots and pans

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to glass and enamel
cookware, which does not

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.704 align:middle line:84%
have nickel in it, and
started using bamboo spoons

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:53.706 align:middle line:90%
to feed little Cody--

00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:54.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They don't
have bacteria in them?

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:55.707 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:57.009 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's not
about the bacteria.

00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:00.846 align:middle line:84%
It's the nickel that was
causing the allergic reaction.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:04.483 align:middle line:84%
I spoke earlier about how
mercury can disrupt the gut.

00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:90%
So can nickel.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.218 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So can nickel.

00:28:06.218 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yeah, you know
how when you wear jewelry?

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.222 align:middle line:84%
For me, I had a really
bad nickel allergy,

00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:13.959 align:middle line:84%
and if I wore custom
jewelry, I'd always get itchy

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:15.227 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, or turn green.

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.728 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Turn green, exactly.

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:20.732 align:middle line:84%
And basically my son had the
similar allergic reaction

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:22.034 align:middle line:90%
to nickel.

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.804 align:middle line:84%
And in his case, it created
this eczema patch on his skin.

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is eczema related to
inflammation and allergies?

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.641 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, it is.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.376 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Skin psoriasis
and so forth.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:32.644 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Exactly.

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:36.782 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a lot of these
hives, red bumps all over,

00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:37.683 align:middle line:90%
eczema, itching--

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:38.917 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bumps behind the arm.

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.953 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes,
bumps behind the arm.

00:28:40.953 --> 00:28:43.055 align:middle line:90%
Some people just swell up.

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden they have
an eye that-- all of that

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.226 align:middle line:90%
is allergic reactions.

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:48.861 align:middle line:84%
Your body is telling
you something

00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:51.296 align:middle line:84%
is wrong because of
these skin issues.

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:52.631 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to dig deep.

00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:55.868 align:middle line:84%
And I ask everyone to be an
allergy detective on their own.

00:28:55.868 --> 00:28:57.336 align:middle line:84%
If you go and read
the book, you're

00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:84%
going to get all the strategies
to become your own allergy

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.241 align:middle line:90%
detective.

00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.108 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now
that was day six.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.678 align:middle line:90%
And then day seven?

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.113 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Day
six is all about--

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.047 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, day six.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: --cleaning
up your body.

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:11.783 align:middle line:90%
Your body.

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:14.853 align:middle line:84%
We have a tendency to
take really short showers.

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:17.189 align:middle line:84%
Like quick showers
because we've got

00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:19.725 align:middle line:84%
to go and get to work or
take care of our children,

00:29:19.725 --> 00:29:20.893 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:29:20.893 --> 00:29:23.462 align:middle line:84%
But did you know, in this
tiny little patch of skin,

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:26.965 align:middle line:84%
we've got almost a million
bacterias and bugs growing.

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:30.636 align:middle line:84%
We've got natural bugs
that are part of our skin

00:29:30.636 --> 00:29:35.073 align:middle line:84%
that we need to constantly
wash away and clean

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and scrub away so that
our immunity-- we do

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.846 align:middle line:84%
have a really big immune
system on our skin as well.

00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.549 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to take care
of our body on the outside

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:90%
as well as on the inside.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.619 align:middle line:84%
I also talk a lot
about exercising.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.756 align:middle line:84%
And if you exercise, the
appropriate types of exercise,

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:53.358 align:middle line:84%
it will calm your
allergy symptoms down,

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
number one by sweating.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.429 align:middle line:84%
If you sweat, you get
rid of your toxins.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:59.431 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What types of
exercise do you recommend?

00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:01.533 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I
actually call what I

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.769 align:middle line:84%
teach my patients
is Burst to Boost.

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:06.205 align:middle line:84%
Burst to boost your
energy, but also burst

00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:09.408 align:middle line:84%
to boost your sweating and
getting rid of your toxins.

00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:14.012 align:middle line:84%
So Burst training is short
term, repetitive short term

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:16.481 align:middle line:90%
and high-high impact.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.817 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
be impact, but a lot

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:22.721 align:middle line:84%
where you feel the increase
in your heart rate.

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.157 align:middle line:84%
So if you increase your
heart rate really quickly

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:26.625 align:middle line:84%
and you do it short
period of time,

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:30.429 align:middle line:84%
so let's say 50 seconds to a
minute, run, run, run, run.

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:31.463 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:34.166 align:middle line:84%
Or climb the stairs
or dance or jump rope.

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.033 align:middle line:90%
I'm a jump roper.

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:36.368 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:30:36.368 --> 00:30:38.337 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Or jump rope, and you
do it for about a minute long,

00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:40.839 align:middle line:84%
then you walk and relax
for another minute.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:43.542 align:middle line:84%
Then you do it again, and
you're doing these cycles

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:47.012 align:middle line:84%
of intervals of
exercise and rest.

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.948 align:middle line:84%
And I only do 15
minutes to 20 maximum.

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.583 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So day seven is--

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.951 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Day
seven is all about

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
dealing with our
stress in our lives.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.624 align:middle line:84%
Stress affects every
part of our body,

00:30:58.624 --> 00:31:01.627 align:middle line:84%
our emotional, mental,
psychological stresses and even

00:31:01.627 --> 00:31:02.794 align:middle line:90%
physical stresses.

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.496 align:middle line:90%
Some people exercise too much.

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:06.632 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about exercising.

00:31:06.632 --> 00:31:08.433 align:middle line:84%
And if you do too
much exercise, you're

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.968 align:middle line:90%
going to cause inflammation.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:13.305 align:middle line:84%
You're not able to handle
the rest of your body dealing

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:14.273 align:middle line:90%
with allergies.

00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:16.308 align:middle line:84%
But regarding the
stresses, I want

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:18.243 align:middle line:84%
people to know that
there's so many things you

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:90%
can do naturally at home.

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:21.213 align:middle line:90%
And I teach that.

00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.315 align:middle line:84%
I give you strategies
on how to help

00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
you deal with your
day-to-day stress.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.119 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do tell, please, a few.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:29.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, the one thing
that I find that people do not

00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:31.923 align:middle line:84%
do enough is scheduling
their day out.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:34.793 align:middle line:84%
If you can deliberately
schedule your day

00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:37.996 align:middle line:84%
and know what you're supposed
to be doing at certain times--

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:40.966 align:middle line:84%
even your meals,
put them in there.

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:42.601 align:middle line:84%
And if you schedule
your day, you

00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.603 align:middle line:84%
don't have to think
about it anymore,

00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:47.506 align:middle line:84%
and it actually helps
you maintain your day.

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:49.107 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
you're not stressed

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:51.276 align:middle line:84%
about getting there on
time and this and that.

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.212 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many times a
day do you suggest eating?

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:56.448 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Oh, I truly
believe that we all

00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:59.785 align:middle line:84%
need meals, three meals a
day, and one to two snacks,

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
depending on the type
of person you are.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.556 align:middle line:84%
If you're an athlete,
you need more food.

00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:07.859 align:middle line:84%
If you're a child, you
also need two snacks.

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:11.129 align:middle line:84%
But an average adult, I
say three meals a day.

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:15.067 align:middle line:84%
And definitely you've got
to have breakfast, and not

00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:17.002 align:middle line:84%
with all the sugars
and all that.

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:20.572 align:middle line:84%
You really want to eat whole
foods, lots of vegetables.

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:21.773 align:middle line:90%
And I've got a list.

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
In the book I give
you all this list.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.346 align:middle line:84%
And if you end up having a
lot of irritable bowel issues,

00:32:27.346 --> 00:32:29.981 align:middle line:84%
you're also going to have to
deal with another special kind

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:32.684 align:middle line:84%
of list that I call my Gut
Restore Food Checklist.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.953 align:middle line:84%
Because that will help
you get rid of your gas

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.621 align:middle line:90%
and bloating and all that.

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:37.622 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about eggs?

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:39.491 align:middle line:84%
Are those considered
dairy for you or no?

00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, eggs
actually comes from a chicken,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.097 align:middle line:84%
so dairy is all about the
milk of the animal, right?

00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The cow's milk, sheep's milk,
goat's milk, buffalo milk.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.703 align:middle line:84%
Eggs actually is one of
the higher allergenic foods

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:52.771 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about the
seven foods that you've

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.408 align:middle line:90%
got to refrain from.

00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:57.442 align:middle line:90%
Eggs is one of them.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.244 align:middle line:90%
And so is peanuts.

00:32:59.244 --> 00:33:01.613 align:middle line:84%
But what you can
have are chicken.

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:05.851 align:middle line:84%
I love of grass fed, grass
finished beef, buffalo meat.

00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:08.019 align:middle line:84%
You know, buffalo
meat in America,

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.688 align:middle line:90%
you're not allowed to cage them.

00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:11.189 align:middle line:84%
They're never
supposed to be caged.

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.591 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed
to be free range.

00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:14.793 align:middle line:84%
So buffalo, bison
meat is actually

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:18.196 align:middle line:84%
the healthier meat,
as well as lamb.

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.032 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that
humans do need meats.

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:23.835 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to and you're
vegetarian, totally fine,

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:27.172 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to have to
really up your amino acids,

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:29.141 align:middle line:84%
supplement amino
acids, so that you

00:33:29.141 --> 00:33:31.543 align:middle line:84%
get enough to help you make
your proteins in your body.

00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:33.412 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was going
to be my next question

00:33:33.412 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
was amino acids--
I mean supplements.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.682 align:middle line:90%
Do you recommend supplements?

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.317 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I actually
love supplements.

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:40.685 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
love supplements

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.688 align:middle line:84%
is because our soils are
not loaded with nutrients

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:44.456 align:middle line:90%
that we want.

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:45.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.591 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And the
vitamins-- there

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:50.562 align:middle line:84%
are essential nutrients, which
are called orthomolecular.

00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:55.634 align:middle line:84%
And if you want your cells to
be living as long as you can--

00:33:55.634 --> 00:33:59.104 align:middle line:84%
and what I mean by that,
without causing aging, right?

00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:00.539 align:middle line:90%
And I'm all about aging now.

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm 52 years old.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I really need to maintain
my health and my vitamins

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.879 align:middle line:90%
and the antioxidants I take.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.216 align:middle line:84%
Antioxidants and green
juices that I have,

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:17.154 align:middle line:84%
they all are to help me maintain
my maximum cellular lifespan.

00:34:17.154 --> 00:34:20.091 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you need
to eat healthier foods.

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:24.229 align:middle line:84%
And then all the fats that
you're eating, fish oils, these

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:28.066 align:middle line:84%
are all important to
maintain, reduce inflammation

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.935 align:middle line:84%
for the brain, for the
allergies we were talking about.

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:33.605 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I truly believe
that supplements do help.

00:34:33.605 --> 00:34:36.007 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would you
say is your typical diet

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.042 align:middle line:90%
look like during the day?

00:34:37.042 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:90%
Start with breakfast.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.143 align:middle line:90%
What do you eat?

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Oh, breakfast--
I love vegetables with eggs.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I put
spinach, tomatoes,

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.821 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of avocado
into-- I use arugula, too.

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.257 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that you
can actually cook arugula.

00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:53.158 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a strong lettuce.

00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:54.125 align:middle line:90%
It's a great taste.

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.026 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Oh, it's so good.

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:55.759 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Adds a lot
of texture to it.

00:34:55.759 --> 00:34:56.728 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:59.164 align:middle line:84%
I actually, when
I go out to eat,

00:34:59.164 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat lettuce because
of the contamination

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.335 align:middle line:90%
of fungus and bacteria.

00:35:03.335 --> 00:35:05.403 align:middle line:90%
I ask them to cook my lettuce.

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:08.773 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to cook my
arugula, cook my radicchio.

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful side
dish just like spinach.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.677 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:15.614 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: But for breakfast,
I love eating that.

00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:84%
And I love having let's
say chicken slices

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:20.085 align:middle line:90%
or a tiny little bit of beef.

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:23.722 align:middle line:84%
And it could only be a
vegetable with a little bit

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:90%
of gluten-free oatmeal.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.995 align:middle line:84%
So I like having carbohydrates,
proteins, and vegetables

00:35:29.995 --> 00:35:31.129 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:35.901 align:middle line:84%
And that is because I have
a very high stressed day.

00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:39.104 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of work throughout
the day with patients.

00:35:39.104 --> 00:35:43.441 align:middle line:84%
And for me to maintain my
health and my adrenal strength,

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.776 align:middle line:90%
I need some carbohydrates.

00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:46.244 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
most of my patients

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.413 align:middle line:84%
do well when they have a
little bit of carbohydrates

00:35:48.413 --> 00:35:49.614 align:middle line:90%
with each meal.

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:52.751 align:middle line:84%
So 50% of your plate will
be veggies, a quarter of it

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:57.355 align:middle line:84%
is protein, a quarter of it
is the carbohydrates-- low

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.958 align:middle line:90%
glycemic of course, gluten free.

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.627 align:middle line:84%
And then you drizzle
a little bit of oil,

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:04.529 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit
of ghee if you want.

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:06.031 align:middle line:84%
Ghee is like the
only thing that I

00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.465 align:middle line:84%
think that the
dairy you can have.

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.533 align:middle line:90%
which is clarified butter.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:09.534 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.903 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's completely
free of lactose,

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
which we can be intolerant
to, and the proteins

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.874 align:middle line:90%
casein and whey.

00:36:15.874 --> 00:36:16.641 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it is?

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.542 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes, it is.

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:18.643 align:middle line:90%
Completely devoid of it.

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:19.411 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's very rich tasting.

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.478 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Oh, it sure is.

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:84%
It's yummy, very, very
soft and liquidy, right?

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:26.985 align:middle line:84%
But it also has butyrate in it,
which is great for your gut.

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
things that you want.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.621 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:31.723 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I always
take my enzymes.

00:36:31.723 --> 00:36:34.859 align:middle line:84%
As we get older, we cannot
produce, we have a tough--

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:39.431 align:middle line:84%
tougher time producing, enzymes
in our gut and small intestine

00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:41.967 align:middle line:84%
and our pancreas, as
well as our stomach.

00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:44.135 align:middle line:84%
So I always-- I
do take an enzyme

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:90%
with my meal in the beginning.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.608 align:middle line:84%
And then I take some of the
vitamins and minerals and oils

00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:54.279 align:middle line:84%
that are healthy for you,
antioxidants in my green drink.

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:56.982 align:middle line:84%
And then as I go into my
lunch, I may have soup.

00:36:56.982 --> 00:37:00.819 align:middle line:84%
I really love soup, because I
love warm foods more than cold.

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even on a hot day?

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.488 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Even on
a hot day, you'll

00:37:03.488 --> 00:37:07.058 align:middle line:84%
see me drinking a hot--
even warm-- water,

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.362 align:middle line:84%
as well as having a soup
with vegetables in it, lots

00:37:10.362 --> 00:37:11.429 align:middle line:90%
of veggies.

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:11.896 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you make a
lot of your own soups?

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:12.998 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: I do.

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:15.834 align:middle line:84%
I love bone broth soup,
like chicken bone broth.

00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:16.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For what reason?

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Because
there's a lot of collagen.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
When you break the
bones and open,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.276 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
collagen that comes out,

00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:26.645 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
nutrients that are

00:37:26.645 --> 00:37:28.713 align:middle line:84%
inside the bone, which
is the bone marrow.

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:29.547 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.615 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:33.818 align:middle line:84%
And that helps with the
healing of your gut.

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:37.455 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of the
collagen and the proteins

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.457 align:middle line:84%
that you want that
will be helpful

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:42.093 align:middle line:84%
for-- and of course
calcium and the nutrients,

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:45.397 align:middle line:84%
and magnesium, as
well the silica.

00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:48.366 align:middle line:84%
All of that is really healthy
for building your gut.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.235 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot of
bone broth soups.

00:37:50.235 --> 00:37:51.236 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:53.238 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that
children eventually

00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:55.874 align:middle line:84%
will grow out of
these allergies?

00:37:55.874 --> 00:37:57.108 align:middle line:90%
Did your child grow out of it?

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: No, of course not.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.112 align:middle line:84%
What ended up happening is after
I implemented all the things

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:05.383 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from
school-- I literally

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:08.053 align:middle line:84%
had to go to post graduate
in environmental medicine

00:38:08.053 --> 00:38:10.889 align:middle line:84%
and allergies and
all the natural ways.

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:13.158 align:middle line:84%
By the time he was three
and a half, four years old,

00:38:13.158 --> 00:38:15.794 align:middle line:84%
he was completely
free-- completely free--

00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:18.296 align:middle line:84%
of allergies, including
anaphylactic reactions.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.933 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: So because
of that, I found out

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:24.903 align:middle line:84%
that-- you know what, how about
all of these other children?

00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:26.004 align:middle line:90%
Do they outgrow it?

00:38:26.004 --> 00:38:27.238 align:middle line:90%
And I say no.

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:30.709 align:middle line:84%
What actually ends up
happening, it goes down deeper.

00:38:30.709 --> 00:38:34.646 align:middle line:84%
So you get these children that
are really overtly allergic,

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:37.782 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of allergic
reactions and hives

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:40.852 align:middle line:84%
and itchiness and anaphylactic
reactions or asthma.

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:43.354 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And ADD, ADHD,
all of those things.

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Those are
sensitivities, often

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to chemicals and toxins in the
foods that we eat and casein

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.061 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.796 align:middle line:84%
But what ends up
happening, it goes deeper.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.965 align:middle line:84%
And they end up
having gut issues.

00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:56.434 align:middle line:84%
They end up having,
instead of the asthma,

00:38:56.434 --> 00:39:00.238 align:middle line:84%
they start having, wow, I now
have irritable bowel symptoms.

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:01.973 align:middle line:90%
I start having colitis.

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:06.745 align:middle line:84%
I have bloating, excess
gas, acid reflux.

00:39:06.745 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
start to happen.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.516 align:middle line:84%
So I find that it's not
that you outgrow it,

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%
it just goes deeper and starts
causing other deeper conditions

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.591 align:middle line:84%
and chronic illness, like
arthritis, like diabetes.

00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:21.826 align:middle line:84%
As you go along,
it can definitely

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:23.795 align:middle line:84%
be part of the whole
inflammatory problem.

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:25.797 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so tell me
about your clinic.

00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:90%
Who comes into your clinic?

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.933 align:middle line:84%
What types of
problems do they have?

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:31.002 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: My clinic in
Santa Monica, California,

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:33.104 align:middle line:84%
is called Wellness
for Life Center.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:37.208 align:middle line:84%
And I've been treating all forms
of different chronic illnesses,

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.844 align:middle line:84%
in particular allergies,
because that is my expertise.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.913 align:middle line:84%
But I also work with
individuals who've

00:39:41.913 --> 00:39:44.382 align:middle line:84%
got dietary issues,
who are having

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.252 align:middle line:84%
chronic symptoms such as
joint pain, headaches.

00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:50.855 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these conditions that
they've gone to other doctors

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:52.757 align:middle line:84%
and have not been
able to figure it out.

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:53.792 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even migraines?

00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Oh, even
migraines, absolutely.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.928 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can be
fixed through diet.

00:39:56.928 --> 00:39:58.696 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, through
diet, through figuring out

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:00.532 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in
their environment.

00:40:00.532 --> 00:40:02.901 align:middle line:84%
Often migraines can
be because something

00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:04.869 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the office even.

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.071 align:middle line:84%
There's chemicals in
the office, and the way

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.942 align:middle line:84%
they are dealing with
the cars, whatever.

00:40:10.942 --> 00:40:13.678 align:middle line:84%
You know those perfume
little trees that you have?

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, those give
me a headache, yeah.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.247 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: There we go.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.248 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.149 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's what
I'm talking about,

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.250 align:middle line:90%
those type of things.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I can figure out by going
through their history,

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.157 align:middle line:84%
looking at their blood labs,
and possibly even needing

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:29.027 align:middle line:84%
to go into their stool
analysis, urine analysis.

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:84%
We do all of it to figure
out what is going on,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.865 align:middle line:84%
getting to the root
cause of your issues.

00:40:33.865 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And then one by one,
we get rid of it.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you end
up having much better outcome,

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.471 align:middle line:90%
and you feel a lot better.

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:42.807 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is I
want you feel better.

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:45.276 align:middle line:84%
Let's get you so that
you have more energy.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.211 align:middle line:90%
You sleep better.

00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:47.712 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And a greater
quality of life.

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:48.847 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: A lot better.

00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:49.881 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:50.849 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: The vitals,
the vitals-- to me,

00:40:50.849 --> 00:40:51.916 align:middle line:90%
I call the vital signs.

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:54.085 align:middle line:90%
Because we need to sleep better.

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:90%
We need to eat well.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.155 align:middle line:84%
We need to have better
bowel movements.

00:40:57.155 --> 00:40:58.289 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:59.791 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: A lot of people
run around not having

00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:00.658 align:middle line:90%
good bowel movements.

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:01.526 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:02.827 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: We want
to sleep better.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:07.465 align:middle line:84%
All of these day-to-day things
that are just basic to life.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:08.733 align:middle line:90%
We've got to do better.

00:41:08.733 --> 00:41:11.502 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that by being
your own allergy detective.

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:12.537 align:middle line:90%
And I will help you.

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.606 align:middle line:84%
That's what we do
a the-- excuse me,

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:16.908 align:middle line:84%
that's what we do at the
Wellness for Life Center.

00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:17.976 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At the clinic.

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And then also the book
will help other people

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.144 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it ever too
late to start something

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
like this, if you're
a senior citizen,

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.183 align:middle line:84%
or if you're well
into an illness?

00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:26.284 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Not even.

00:41:26.284 --> 00:41:29.387 align:middle line:84%
I see children from
newborn-- in fact,

00:41:29.387 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the hospitals
on the day they're born,

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.291 align:middle line:90%
and then I looked at them.

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.561 align:middle line:84%
And definitely up into
the 70s, 80s, 90s.

00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:39.264 align:middle line:90%
We can do it any time, any time.

00:41:39.264 --> 00:41:42.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my students-- because
I have programs online.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.368 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my students
are actually

00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:45.703 align:middle line:90%
in the 60s, 70s, and even 80s.

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:49.073 align:middle line:84%
And as they get older, they
can change a few things,

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:50.775 align:middle line:90%
and they can feel better.

00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:51.609 align:middle line:90%
And why not?

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:53.077 align:middle line:90%
Why not start anytime?

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.879 align:middle line:90%
You've just got to be motivated.

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:56.948 align:middle line:90%
You've got to want to feel good.

00:41:56.948 --> 00:41:59.117 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
both of that, then you

00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:00.919 align:middle line:84%
can definitely be able
to change your life.

00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.155 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with this
anti-inflammation diet, which

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:06.457 align:middle line:84%
is basically what it is
that you're doing here.

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.527 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled a muscle
the other day in my back,

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.397 align:middle line:90%
and I healed it through food.

00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:16.301 align:middle line:84%
I actually ate my
way clean enough

00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:20.738 align:middle line:84%
that it was gone in a half a
day-- and ice and so forth.

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.774 align:middle line:90%
But I managed to do that.

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:24.776 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying
it as an experiment

00:42:24.776 --> 00:42:30.114 align:middle line:84%
to see if I ate the clean, clean
foods, vegetables and protein

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:84%
only, no grains, no wheat, no
dairy, no sugar, no coffee.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.155 align:middle line:90%
It actually healed my body.

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:37.822 align:middle line:90%
I just tried it.

00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:38.589 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That makes sense.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:39.924 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a great experiment.

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:40.625 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It is.

00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:42.026 align:middle line:90%
Why not live that way--

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:42.894 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.095 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: If you can, yes.

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:46.631 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because in a way I
viewed it as restrictive.

00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:47.832 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:49.534 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because I was
so used to the old habits

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:50.735 align:middle line:90%
and patterns.

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:53.838 align:middle line:84%
But if I could feel like I
feel every single day when

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:57.875 align:middle line:84%
I did that and healed
the back muscle,

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.877 align:middle line:84%
and to wake up
clear-headed, and to not

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:02.847 align:middle line:84%
have foggy thinking, and
to really just be active

00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:04.582 align:middle line:84%
and not need coffee
at 4 o'clock.

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.784 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Could you imagine
how efficient you'll be?

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:07.852 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:07.852 --> 00:43:11.289 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: How efficient
that pure mental focus

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:13.257 align:middle line:84%
and the actions
that you go into.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.662 align:middle line:84%
I call it my seventh sense, is
that when I'm feeling the best,

00:43:17.662 --> 00:43:19.263 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my seventh sense.

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.332 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
really can focus,

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:24.535 align:middle line:84%
that mental focus, and that
intuitive feeling that you get,

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:26.938 align:middle line:84%
that aha moment, which
I call the sixth sense,

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people,
we know about that.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.008 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what's the seventh?

00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Seventh to me--
if you look at it online,

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.078 align:middle line:84%
they call it the
divine love energy.

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:37.181 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's
actually, I call it--

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:39.217 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about this
for many, many years.

00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Because as an athlete,
there's a feeling

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.957 align:middle line:84%
that we get when you just
know you're in the zone.

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:46.858 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:43:46.858 --> 00:43:48.226 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You have
that aha moment.

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.361 align:middle line:84%
You just know how
good it feels inside.

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:53.931 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got that mental
pure focus, and your body's

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:57.769 align:middle line:84%
right on that edge, in
combination with action,

00:43:57.769 --> 00:43:58.903 align:middle line:90%
that's the seventh sense.

00:43:58.903 --> 00:43:59.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're in the flow.

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:01.472 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You're
in the-- very good.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.306 align:middle line:90%
You know the flow.

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.174 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:44:03.174 --> 00:44:04.375 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It's exactly that.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.511 align:middle line:84%
And I love to live
in that manner.

00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:10.081 align:middle line:84%
If I live in that manner, then
I'm the happiest I can be.

00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:12.083 align:middle line:90%
I can be of service to everyone.

00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:14.552 align:middle line:90%
I can be present with my family.

00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:16.421 align:middle line:90%
I can be present with you.

00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:21.359 align:middle line:84%
I experience enthusiasm and
life in such a different way.

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:23.928 align:middle line:84%
And I find that this really
helps my patients, too,

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:26.030 align:middle line:84%
because how can I be
good to my patients--

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, if
you're not practicing--

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:28.566 align:middle line:90%
yes-- this yourself.

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:29.801 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: I just can't.

00:44:29.801 --> 00:44:31.302 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are
such an inspiration.

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:34.939 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate the fact
that you love living full out

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:37.975 align:middle line:84%
and that you like a
switched-on state of mind.

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.211 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I mean, I've
gone to doctors before,

00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:42.513 align:middle line:84%
and they look sicker than I
do when I walk in the door.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.514 align:middle line:90%
And yeah--

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:44.549 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It's sad, isn't it?

00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:45.817 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to see
the example of what

00:44:45.817 --> 00:44:48.319 align:middle line:84%
I want to be sitting on
the other side of that desk

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:50.621 align:middle line:84%
and then empower myself
to do this on my own.

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:52.056 align:middle line:90%
This is a lifestyle change.

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:53.057 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That is true.

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:54.358 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:55.393 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Thank you.

00:44:55.393 --> 00:44:56.427 align:middle line:84%
It could be "The 7-Day
Lifestyle Makeover."

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:57.662 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:44:57.662 --> 00:44:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Take the word "allergy"
out, you could

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.431 align:middle line:90%
put anything else in there.

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:00.865 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That's right.

00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:01.532 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.767 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inflammation, yes.

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yeah, you can
transform your life immediately

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:07.905 align:middle line:84%
just from changing
little things one by one.

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:08.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:45:08.673 --> 00:45:09.307 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Thank you.

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:10.508 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:12.343 align:middle line:84%
