00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that giving is
actually good for your health?

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I once heard Oprah say that the
greatest way to self-healing

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:90%
is to help others.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what my
guest has done, Cynthia Kersey.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
She is the Chief
Humanitarian Officer

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Unstoppable
Foundation, which

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what Cynthia
is, unstoppable.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Her mission is to ensure that
every child on the planet

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
receives access to the
life-long gift of education.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
She's done this through
the Unstoppable Foundation.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It has already funded
over 65 schools

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and educated-- it educates
6,000 children a day.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
You have done such an amazing
job with your foundation,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so grateful
that you are here.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA KERSEY: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.608 align:middle line:84%
So, how did this
all start for you?

00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:90%
Tell me the story.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.117 align:middle line:90%
Your 50th birthday, right?

00:01:06.117 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Right, exactly.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, prior to that, I went
to this rural African women

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I got invited to go
to this conference.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that I
knew that was happening there

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is that women from rural
Africa were coming together

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%
to share their stories.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing that I knew.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you get invited?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: A friend
knew the organizer.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
So I knew one person.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:90%
She said she was going to go.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just really
felt led to go.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
It was kinda crazy.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a calling.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.745 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: A calling.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So I just rearranged my
schedule and booked this flight

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and flew over to Kenya.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And then I got
on this bus with 40 women

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
from North America,
and we spent two days

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
on the bus going into the
interior of Kenya-- you know,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
bumping up and down and no,
what's it called, suspension.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.491 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And it was
interesting, Lisa,

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.305 align:middle line:84%
because I was
noticing myself kind

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of getting a little
more annoyed.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.388 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
sitting on the bus,

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
it's like First World
problems, right?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, God help
me get over my little self

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
so I don't miss why
I'm here, because I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:90%
knew I was there for a reason.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't just fly to
Kenya and go on a two-day bus.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's just
back up for a second.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can understand
going to a conference

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:90%
in your hometown.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in your
life to make you actually

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.552 align:middle line:90%
take that trip?

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Right.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting, because
I'd really already experienced

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:90%
many, many projects.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I wrote my
first book, "Unstoppable,"

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
18 months after it came out,
I got separated and divorced

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
from my husband of 20 years.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And my mentor
was Millard Fuller,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the founder of
Habitat for Humanity.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I called him and
told him what had happened,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
he said, why don't you build
a house for a family in need?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing
that he said to me

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is, when you have a
great pain in your life,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
you need a greater purpose.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:90%
So that was the catalyst.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that 100
houses building in Nepal

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:90%
was bigger than my pain.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So that year, where I'm
having a brand new book out,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I would go out and talk
about this project.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:90%
And I raised $200,000 that year.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I took a group of
18 people to Nepal,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and it completely
changed my life.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
major experience

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
with the power of giving.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So after that happened,
then I was consistently

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:90%
doing other projects.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And my second book, "Unstoppable
Women," came out in 2005.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of looking
for another project.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I was invited
to the conference,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:90%
it resonated at some level.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's what got you
to fly all the way to Africa

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and to get on the bus.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And what did you find
when you got to Kenya?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So that's
such a great question.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I met--
well, first of all,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
these women greeted us,
and we were dancing.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see their faces
and their-- the love and just

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
their open-heartedness.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
And I met two women,
Rose and Jawaher.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Rose is about 60, in her 60s.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And Jawaher is early
20s, with a baby.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And those women, I
fell in love with them.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
is, of course,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
the surroundings
were very rural.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Big, huge roaches, and I
mean all sorts of things.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.375 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when I was there,
I felt like I was in heaven.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Really.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because of
the love that you--

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was missing.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So all of the stuff that I had
about, you know, getting there

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and being with all of
these women, I mean,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
literally the women
from North America,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.454 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of seeing myself
as not a group person.

00:05:00.454 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that is about.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But when I got there, it was
like everything fell away.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.712 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely present and
in the moment with these women.

00:05:09.712 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you
say that that was

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:90%
a bit of an awakening for you?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.575 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just a cosmic,
conscious cracking open?

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was your calling.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.825 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: It was
a huge calling.

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I was
really struck by is,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
number one, how
empowered they were.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So they came together-- they
were looking not for a handout,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
but looking for
solutions to things

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
we never even have
to think about.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
How do they get
access to clean water?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
How do they treat
their children when

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
they get malaria or
waterborne illnesses?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all sorts of
issues we don't deal with.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with their
crops and preserve food

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
with consistent and
persistent drought?

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And the number one thing
they were looking for

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.845 align:middle line:84%
is how do we get our
kids into school?

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did they express this
to you when you were there?

00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Over and over and over.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I was really taken
by is, number one, first off,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:84%
how optimistic and how
empowered they were.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Because when I looked
at their situation,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:90%
I felt pretty much overwhelmed.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, how could
they be so optimistic?

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.721 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And loving and open?

00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.053 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And they're
there not as a victim

00:06:20.053 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
but looking for solutions.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And the other piece
was I thought, wow,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, how is this right that
they're born in a place where

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know
if their-- you know,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
how to get education
for their own child.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm born in a country
where it's given to everyone.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Assumed.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.604 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah, and
children and many people

00:06:42.604 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
don't even take it for granted.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.322 align:middle line:84%
So it just really struck
me, the injustice of that.

00:06:47.322 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just
a matter of where

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:84%
you were born
determines your fate.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.994 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And think about
the United States,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and especially when you meet all
of these extraordinary people,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
we have access to everything.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.762 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, looking at
the videos and the slides

00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to
take a look at really

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.322 align:middle line:84%
showed the women just walking
seven, eight miles a day.

00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Right.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:90%
One way.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One way.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: One way.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To go to
a muddy riverbank.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To pull out muddy water.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.879 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Dirty.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.213 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like a stream--

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.213 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Contaminated.

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
That's right,
contaminated water.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And carry it on their back.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.619 align:middle line:84%
And they do that multiple times
a day, the women and the girls.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:30.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so there is
no time for education.

00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are raised
to support the village.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And this is your fate.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:90%
You're in survival.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So did you
make a conscious choice

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to want to change the
fate of these villagers?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So what I said
to them is I said-- I did.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I fell in love with them.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I gave them
everything that I had.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.959 align:middle line:84%
We weren't supposed
to give them anything.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I literally gave them my bra.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I gave them my gym shoes.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK, this
is what I have now.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I promised them
I would do something.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what it was, but I

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:90%
knew I had to do something.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I came home and
started doing some research

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.672 align:middle line:84%
and really got
education is the key.

00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
landed on education.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it helped
all the other things,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
which we're going
to learn about.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.945 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Exactly.

00:08:16.945 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So the conference that
you went to-- and here's

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
a picture of you in this-- at
this African women's conference

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
You met these
women, and these two

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
women on either side of
you, are these the women--

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Grace
is on the right.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And Jawaher is on the left.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:30.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:08:30.765 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So you learned that there was
a global education crisis.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So I come back and I start
doing some of my own education

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:90%
around this issue.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And really got-- it
is a global problem.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
57 million children

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world who don't even have
a primary education, and just

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to give a little
context, that would

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
be every child in the
United States 14 years

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.011 align:middle line:90%
of age and younger.

00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.842 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Can you imagine?

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all know someone--

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
many 57 million is.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.937 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: That's how
many 57 million is.

00:09:07.937 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Per year
you're talking about.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.441 align:middle line:90%
Around the world, that's right.

00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And 43% of all of those children
are in the sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: 43%.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So when people say why Africa,
first off, I'm called to it.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And the need is the greatest.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like triage,
with an emergency room,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
you look for where is
the need the greatest,

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and you start there.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The biggest density of
children are in that area, 43%.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: 43%.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's
explainable when

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
you talked about how
their days are spent.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So to change this trajectory
for these children

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:90%
is no small effort.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're continuing
to learn that.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.236 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now
that you've learned

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's a global
education crisis, what

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
happens when these people
don't have an education?

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:90%
What is the result in their--

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.396 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, it's like,
no matter how hard they try,

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
committed they are,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
they will never be able
to change anything.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So they'll never be able to
lift themselves out of poverty.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
They'll never be able to
really pursue their dreams,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
actualize their dreams,
even get a good job.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If you can't read or write,
what is the possibility

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.257 align:middle line:90%
for your life?

00:10:19.257 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
stay in the village.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And you're in survival.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all about surviving.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So kids, they are taken out of
school to work with the animals

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.564 align:middle line:90%
or work to earn money.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the
fields or whatever.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right,
so they can survive.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
taught their traditions,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but they're never able to get
out of the cycle of poverty

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.589 align:middle line:90%
that they've lasted in for--

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Forever.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.359 align:middle line:84%
Generations and generations
and generations.

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we have that area,
say, of the world that's

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in that level of
poverty, how does that

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
affect the rest of the world?

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.704 align:middle line:90%
And this next slide shows.

00:10:57.704 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I love this because
we think in North America,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
or certainly in
developed countries,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
well, how does it impact us
when a child is uneducated?

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
day, uneducated children

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
are a breeding ground for
terrorism, political unrest,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
global epidemics and pandemics.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.149 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Violence.

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Terrorism.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And we are all at risk.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
57 million children,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:90%
that is a lot of children.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.097 align:middle line:84%
And we can't create
a global society

00:11:35.097 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that works for
everyone thinking we're

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
going to leave all
those children behind.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And that they just don't exist.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you found out-- let's
address really quickly the idea

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.144 align:middle line:84%
about the pandemic and
the health care situation.

00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.685 align:middle line:84%
So there's no health
care whatsoever.

00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:52.351 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: None.

00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Or marginal.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Only if it comes
in from outside areas.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Oh, right.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you have that
level of poverty,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
you have children that
have malaria, that contract

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.905 align:middle line:90%
different types of viruses.

00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:06.937 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's no
curing those viruses.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They just spread rampantly.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Or there may be some
sort of facility hours away.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I've just
seen-- experienced children--

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
the Gates Foundation, he
called it impatient optimists.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was this
video of this mother

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
who her little girl had malaria.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they walked for
days with this mom,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and then they caught a van.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And on the way to the
hospital, the little girl died.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is a very common thing.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if your child is sick,
and there's nowhere to go.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And you hold that baby, and
you're walking for days.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just for a solution.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.715 align:middle line:90%
Just for some medicine.

00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Something.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
For a price of a cup of
coffee, they could be cured.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cured.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you end this
type of poverty cycle,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
just take one
person, for example,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:90%
how does it change their life?

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
If you just start
to educate a child,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.019 align:middle line:84%
what difference
begins to happen?

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, I mean,
there's so many stories.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have-- I mean, it's
like-- well, I was gonna--

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.507 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we
want to jump ahead,

00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:90%
but there's a couple of stories.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, even the
Chris Mburu story.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you want
me to talk about that now.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Let's
talk about this,

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:90%
because that's really relevant.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So here's a kid about
25 miles from Nairobi.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.522 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have
a picture of him.

00:13:35.522 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: There he is.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Love this.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so he's 25 miles
outside in a little village

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in Nairobi, grown up in this
little thatched roof hut.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
His parents are living on,
I think it's $0.40 a day.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So he's in and out of school,
because no matter how hard

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
he studies-- and basically,
his mom said, listen.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Your way out of this survival
is through an education.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how hard he
worked, how committed he was,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that would not
keep him in school.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Only money will do that,
because they pay school fees.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:20.127 align:middle line:84%
So even in very extreme
poverty communities,

00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
they still have to pay-- many
of them have to pay school fees.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They have to
pay to go to school.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.537 align:middle line:84%
It's not a lot, but when
you're making $0.40 a day--

00:14:26.537 --> 00:14:27.328 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a lot.

00:14:27.328 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: It's a lot.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it takes
the children off of--

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he's
in and out of school,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
hoping he'll get
out of the fields

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
one day so that he can
actually really get

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:90%
that education he needs.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, across the
world is Hilde Back.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And Hilde Back was
raised in Nazi Germany.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:90%
She was now living in Sweden.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
kindness of a stranger,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
he paid for her and her
family to escape Nazi Germany,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:90%
or they would have died.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.357 align:middle line:84%
And so she was looking
for a way to give back.

00:15:01.357 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To pay if forward.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Pay it forward.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And he-- she heard about
this Kenyan educational fund,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:90%
and she heard about Chris Mburu.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And she thought, you know what?

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pay
his school fees.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So every month, she
would pay really

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
something that she felt was very
nominal, kept paying his fees.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And year after year, she
never misses a payment.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And here Chris is, he is
able to stay in school.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And basically what that
looks like is he's in school,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
but after school,
he's doing his chores.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's not studying until
late at night by candlelight.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:90%
But he's committed.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
she didn't realize

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that she was giving him
more than an education.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
She was giving him really a hope
for a whole different future.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So Chris Mburu, talk about what
can education do for one child.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
He ended up graduating from
primary school and then

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:90%
secondary school.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
He was able to go to college.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to get the
resources to go to Harvard.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my God.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And
graduate from Harvard.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And he became an
advocate, of course,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
for children who have
no-- had no voice.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And he started an
educational fund, just

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
like what Hilde had done--
and had given money to.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the Hilde
Back Educational Fund.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And now he's paying it
forward by giving hundreds

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of children access
to an education.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.485 align:middle line:84%
And he became very
inspired to meet Hilde.

00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And he started looking for her.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And he traveled all the
way around the world

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.392 align:middle line:84%
to tell her that
she was his hero.

00:16:39.392 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.199 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And she
said she didn't

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:90%
feel like she was a hero.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
She was just doing
what she could.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet the ripple effect
of her consistent investment

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
not only changed Chris'
life but really now

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
thousands of other
children's lives.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
That's from one child
getting an education.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.816 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting
that her last name is Back,

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly
what she did is give back.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.221 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:07.942 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how-- now, when
she donated the money through

00:17:07.942 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:90%
your foundation--

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:09.565 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: It wasn't
through our foundation.

00:17:09.565 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it was another--

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: No, no.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.853 align:middle line:90%
That was a different foundation.

00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Because this was
a long time ago.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But along the lines of
foundation, how did she know,

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
or how would one know--
and I'm sure you've

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
been asked this a zillion
times-- does it go directly

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
into the community?

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, obviously it
did, because it paid his fees.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And he was able
to go to school--

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Come back to her.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.624 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: So it came back.

00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was like this
visual representation.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We have ways of connecting
people, our donors,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to the impact, too,
which is important.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%
But I think that's living proof.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that it can
be-- that the difference can

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
be made, and the
money can go directly

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:90%
into the people that need it.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
you want to know

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.584 align:middle line:84%
is that this money is really
going to help somebody.

00:17:50.584 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Absolutely.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.041 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And you-- you're there in
Africa how many times a year?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well,
it really depends.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:90%
We're there at least twice.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have people on
the ground full time.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And we go over there, and we
document every single project.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So we are-- we have the
implementing partners

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:90%
that implement all the programs.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we manage it, we
oversee it, we take pictures,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
we document it, and then
we bring information

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
back to the donors, so that
they're connected to it.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So how much would
it take to actually

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.294 align:middle line:90%
educate those 43 million--

00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: 57 million.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.007 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 57 million.

00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So that's
a great question.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And studies say that it
would cost about $15 billion

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
every year to
educate every child.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds like a
lot of money-- actually,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:90%
they say $11 to 15 billion.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a lot of money,
but when you think about it,

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
we spent twice that last
year in North America

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:90%
alone on ice cream.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, think about all
the billion-dollar industries

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Beauty is a
billion-dollar industry.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Beauty, we spent $160
billion on skin care.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That doesn't even work.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Or $60 billion
trying to lose weight.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Or $45 billion dollars
feeding our dogs and cats.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
any of that's wrong,

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
but the point is
the money is there.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.039 align:middle line:84%
We just need to have the
will, the collective will.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In North America.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And giving people ways
they can plug in that

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.705 align:middle line:84%
feel really good about
what they're doing.

00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what we know
is people love to give.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As I mentioned earlier--
and it also, as Oprah said,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the
greatest ways-- you

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
use the example of self-healing
to actually be a contribution

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and to turn around, and just to
contribute to something so much

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:90%
bigger than us.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Oh my gosh,
it changes everything.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then when
you went to Kenya

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and you realized that
that was-- after you

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.648 align:middle line:84%
did all your
research, you realized

00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
that was the greatest
need, how did you then

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:90%
mobilize into this foundation?

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:90%
What was the catalyst for that?

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.544 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Great,
great question.

00:20:06.544 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So basically, again, I looked
at who is doing the work.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:90%
What kind of model really works?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
great organizations

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
will build schools, and
then you can go back two,

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:84%
three years later,
and they're empty.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was--
well, first off,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
can I talk a little bit
about the birthday party?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.475 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
happened-- let's

00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:90%
just step back for a second.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So, I was doing
all this research,

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
really got education is the key.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm thinking, well,
how can I do something?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So my first step was-- six
years ago, I had a big birthday.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.996 align:middle line:90%
It was my 50th birthday.

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And what was kind of interesting
about it is at the time,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I was actually feeling
a little depressed

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
about having my
50th birthday, which

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is kind of-- talk about
a First World problem.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.397 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of insane.

00:20:55.397 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
People are happy to make
it to their 50th birthday

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in other places
around the world.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But I just had
this thing about it

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and was looking at what
do I really want to do?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm at Debbie Ford's
house for Thanksgiving.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling me
about her son Beau, who

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
for his Bar Mitzvah
instead of getting gifts

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
asked people to donate
money to help at a school.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And literally, Lisa,
I sat up on the couch

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, that's
what I'm going to do.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use my birthday
and ask people to donate money.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what I did.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:90%
I charged them $100.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.535 align:middle line:84%
And then when they came,
it was in Marina Del Ray

00:21:29.535 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
at Shanghai Red's,
at the restaurant.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked them for money
again, but it was not for me.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
It was for these children,
and we raised enough money

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.795 align:middle line:90%
to build two schools in Uganda.

00:21:40.795 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my
gosh, in one night.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: In one night.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So that was the beginning.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
really looking, OK,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:90%
how do I scale this?

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And really, who's doing
the work over there?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And the partner that we found
in the Maasai Mara in Kenya

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
is fantastic.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And they have a track record.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.437 align:middle line:84%
And the programs that they were
implementing were in alignment.

00:22:03.437 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And they follow through.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.331 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:09.094 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we started
making a huge investment.

00:22:09.094 --> 00:22:11.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, when did you
come up with the five pillars

00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:14.707 align:middle line:84%
and realizing it's not just the
schools that you need to help

00:22:14.707 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:90%
but every-- all of these other--

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.956 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, yeah.

00:22:16.956 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
several organizations

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:90%
that get this is critical.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So people who are really
successful in development,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
especially in these
particular communities, really

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
get you need to do
all five pillars.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Although a lot of
people don't do that.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:84%
They'll do water or
they'll do schools.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.125 align:middle line:84%
And so we found--
Free the Children

00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
is our implementing
partner in Kenya.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing a four
pillar model at that point.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
expanded to the five.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:90%
So we were really in alignment.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They implemented a model that
we believed in and supported,

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and it was a perfect
relationship.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So the five pillars are
education and clean water and--

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.032 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Clean
water sanitation.

00:23:00.032 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then the food
and nutrition, teaching them

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.871 align:middle line:90%
how to grow, reharvest.

00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Organic gardens, healthy living.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
tenants to really

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
having a healthy
life and a lifestyle.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
the health care.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.226 align:middle line:90%
So bringing in--

00:23:20.226 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Mobile
health clinics.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vaccinations.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Every single month.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.651 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of things.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:90%
De-worming.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.232 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
basic health care

00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that makes a huge difference.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And then there are two
bigger health care clinics

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that are fantastic, and
they just now implemented

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
a child birth center, which
is just amazing, because so

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
many women in this particular
area, the highest mortality

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in the world because
of childbirth.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, you talk a
little bit about that,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
around the children
literally 10, 11 years old,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.431 align:middle line:84%
these girls are forced
off to be married.

00:23:56.431 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And explain how and
why that situation occurs.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So
basically, they don't

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
see a possibility
for their girls.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
If there's not an
education, then how

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
are they going to
be taken care of?

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And they see the boys that
they'll be able to continue.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But the girls, a
lot of girls, they

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
don't keep their
girls in school.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why are the boys
able to continue more?

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, I don't--
I think there's something--

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
first off, they see the girls
as needing to stay at home

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:90%
to support the family.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So they are the ones that
are fetching the water.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are even
fetching firewood and really

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:90%
helping preserve the family.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they feel like the only
way to keep their girls healthy

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:90%
is to marry them off.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And then also they get a dowry.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.435 align:middle line:84%
So they get money when they're
marrying their child off,

00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's another kind
of survival mechanism.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And when these girls
are getting married,

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
they're having babies at an
age where their body is not

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
really ready to give birth.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So a high percentage
of the children

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:84%
have-- either they
die in childbirth,

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
or they have all sorts
of complications.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you start having a
baby, it's like the cycle,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
you never get out of it.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:90%
You never get out of it.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they-- the
children, which are still

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
children at 11, 12 years
old, are having babies.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they're not
birthing the children

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
because they die in childbirth.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.124 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
perpetual cycle that's

00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
been going on for
years and years.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you're breaking
such a major cycle like this,

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%
it takes a huge initiative.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: It really does.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, just to start
with something like education.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.653 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: It really does.

00:25:35.653 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
to be on board.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going
into these communities

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and pushing any
kind of ideologies

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of a-- our
solution or religion.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It is a-- We are met.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:90%
They're standing with us.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They are committed to
keeping their kids in school,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
keeping their girls in school.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a
partnership, which

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is really important
for long term change.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a picture here
of one of the schoolhouses.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they
look like basically

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.441 align:middle line:90%
before you got to them, right?

00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a typical
schoolhouse there.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And the one on the
right, it's still being used.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So this classroom
is being used today.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, it's sorely
a dilapidated-- it's dark.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got mud floors.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And they've put
hundreds of children.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They'll just cram them.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hundreds into that room.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Into these
little rooms, yeah.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And they're all ages.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.666 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: They're all ages.

00:26:32.666 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And they'll teach one grade
on one blackboard and then one

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:90%
grade on the other.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's just havoc.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, loud.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.095 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: It's loud.

00:26:39.095 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And there's no windows.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the
environment, there's

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
one group learning
here and another group

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:90%
there and another group there.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
ages, 100 in that one room.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.421 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I could see
the need for that.

00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.771 align:middle line:84%
So you've implemented
these schools,

00:26:56.771 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
building new structures now.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then let's
talk about the clean water

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and the sanitation.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.669 align:middle line:84%
We've got a picture here of the
girls when they are actually--

00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
this is the river that
I was talking about.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.043 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: We've
taken those pictures.

00:27:10.043 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Those are pictures at the
river with little girls

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and the mothers who are--
it is quite arduous.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We've taken people over
there, donors and partners.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And most of the women who we
take over there cannot carry

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the 40 pounds of dirty
water on their back.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:90%
It's too heavy.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And the women are doing it
with babies, the young girls.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We will see little girls
with a little teeny can.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they start when
they're four or five years old

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
with these little water jugs
that the little girls are

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:90%
carrying at a very young age.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.384 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They start
very early learning

00:27:46.384 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:90%
how to carry these big jugs.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And then they bring them back.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.536 align:middle line:84%
And then how do they
sanitize the muddy water?

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, hopefully
they're boiling it.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the education
process that you asked about.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So, and you know,
well, you know,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
sanitation is a
very important part.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Clean water and sanitation
go hand in hand.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have to teach
people about the importance

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of your hand washing
and boiling that water.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The last thing
they're going to do

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.426 align:middle line:90%
is wash their hands, though.

00:28:13.426 --> 00:28:16.157 align:middle line:84%
Once they've got clean water,
they're going to cook with it.

00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:90%
They're going to drink it.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.201 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the last thing
that they're going to do,

00:28:20.201 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:90%
thus the spread of disease.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So at the schools, we
have hand washing stations

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:84%
with soap and then this
jar, and then it opens

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and the water comes out.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It's kinda-- with a bucket.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And then kids are constantly--
because I mean, think about it.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have toilet
paper in the latrines.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
you've got a slide here,

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:84%
but the latrines, the
old latrines were--

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.785 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of girls
in these communities

00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
are not allowed to go to
school because they're not

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
allowed to share a
latrine with a boy.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So that was another reason that
girls would-- after you get

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
a certain age, or if
they're menstruating,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
they weren't allowed
to go to school.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.589 align:middle line:84%
So now we are building
latrines for girls and boys.

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.465 align:middle line:90%
So they've got their own place.

00:29:02.465 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again, the things
we take for granted here,

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:84%
the girls restroom,
the boys restroom.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even exist.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And so you're supporting them
in having a place to actually go

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to the restroom as
they're in school.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: That's
right, so if they're

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:84%
having their time of the month,
they can still come to school.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so now
let's talk a little bit

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
about-- we have a slide
here of the health

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:90%
care and the nutrition.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is-- other than not
having any access to vaccines,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.785 align:middle line:84%
or if they do get
malaria, having

00:29:33.785 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
a vaccination for
malaria ahead of time,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.729 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing those
types of things in.

00:29:38.729 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: There's no
vaccination, unfortunately,

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:90%
for malaria.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But the deworming, there's
also-- treating them

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
when they get-- one
out of five children

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
die of waterborne
illnesses before the age

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:90%
of five years old.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So dysentery, diarrhea
is a huge problem.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we provide
mobile health clinics

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that go into the communities.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And you should see it.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, you'll see
hundreds of children lining up,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.082 align:middle line:84%
ready to be either, you
know, whatever the services

00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:90%
that they're providing.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And it makes a huge difference.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a slide here
of-- isn't that beautiful?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.731 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Look at those faces!

00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, of
getting the clean water.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is coming from a well?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's a bore hole.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happens is
the bore holes are very deep.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:35.829 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like they then have
offshoots of water systems.

00:30:35.829 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
That's one of them.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the little kiosks,
where the families and the kids

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.979 align:middle line:90%
can get water.

00:30:41.979 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is right at the school.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.067 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they dig
deep into the ground.

00:30:45.067 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: It's very deep.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They dig these holes and
pump it out from the pressure.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, so
we do it hand in hand.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.706 align:middle line:84%
So we have staff and
people on the ground that

00:30:52.706 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:84%
work with the communities to
create this and then maintain

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
it, because that's
another big part of it.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.331 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then they
can build gardens?

00:31:00.331 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, flourishing gardens.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.917 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Another great
picture here of--

00:31:04.917 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Oh, yeah.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.534 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --in their
gardens, and they're

00:31:07.534 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:90%
actually growing their own food.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they have access to
clean and healthy food

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.297 align:middle line:84%
in that particular
region, which is amazing.

00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we haven't talked about
the part where you actually

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:84%
educate them on how
to make an income.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.175 align:middle line:84%
And this is specifically
with the women, right?

00:31:21.175 --> 00:31:21.883 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Right.

00:31:21.883 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, it starts with the women.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is--
because in the beginning,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:90%
the men aren't interested.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But when they start seeing
the women coming together,

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and basically they have this
thing called a Merry Go Round.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So every single week,
they bring a little-- I'll

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
bring a shilling, and
she'll bring a shilling.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:90%
We pool our money together.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And then one mom gets to
take the money for the month.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So as this process
continues, they're

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
able to buy things that are
necessary for the family, buy

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:84%
seed and grain
for their gardens.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
gardens at their home.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:90%
They call it a kitchen garden.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's where they go out
and they get their food.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But eventually it
allows them to even buy

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
bricks and things to
build their own homes.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And the men start
seeing what's happening,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, we
want to do that, too.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we have men's groups that
are thriving in their learning,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.830 align:middle line:84%
because basically the
women are then buying land

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to build
more schools or to be

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
able to expand the community.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To put the
land towards good use.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Curiously, why are
the men put off when you come?

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Well,
it's not all of them.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:90%
It's really not all of them.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:90%
But it is a cultural thing.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So when we're there, the men
that are there are committed.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones that
are-- they're the leaders.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
They're the chiefs
in the community.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.495 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:90%
So they're absolutely committed.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I met a man who had-- I
think he had 12 children,

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and he made sure that every
single one of his children

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
not only went to primary
school, but they ended up

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:90%
going to secondary school.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:84%
That was unheard
of, because that

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
means he had to find
a secondary school

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and send those children away.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To live, basically.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Yes, to be
able to go to school.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.865 align:middle line:90%
But that was a very high value.

00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So obviously he's a
leader in the community.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He was a leader.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's important.

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:90%
So he was a leader.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the men who
basically were standoffish

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
were maybe threatened
by the situation.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: They could be.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.579 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:27.579 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
They're community members.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But as they start seeing
what's happening-- plus women

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.022 align:middle line:84%
play a very subservient
role in the communities.

00:33:34.022 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So now all of a
sudden, the women--

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.271 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Culturally.

00:33:36.271 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: --that's right--
are earning money and feeling

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:90%
more empowered.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
They can be threatened by them,
but a lot of men are thinking,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.499 align:middle line:90%
this is fantastic.

00:33:45.499 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because
it contributes

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:90%
to the lack of survival.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.174 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a picture
here that you've given us

00:33:53.174 --> 00:33:54.272 align:middle line:90%
of the vans where--

00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah, there it is.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --you bring
in the vans, and kids

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
can get access to vitamins,
health care, as you said,

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:90%
certain vaccinations.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's also here a
picture of the school.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
schools that you built.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.228 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: I love this.

00:34:10.228 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're running.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: I know.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.614 align:middle line:84%
In our schools, the children
actually run to school.

00:34:16.614 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And it's not because
it's an exercise program.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it because
they so value it.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing about
these children, Lisa,

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
is after school you'll see
hundreds of children walking

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
hours, sometimes a
couple of hours a day.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Home?

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Home.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the schools
that we had, they

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:84%
had to actually
move it because it

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.015 align:middle line:84%
was right in the
path of the elephant.

00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wild animals?

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So the kids were
in danger, so they

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
had to actually move
the entire school.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the middle
of the Maasai Mara, where

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.054 align:middle line:84%
there's all sorts
of wild animals

00:34:52.054 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and-- So these children
are walking, some of them,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hours every
single day, one way,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to go to school, because
it's so important to them.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a picture here
of one of the children walking,

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.905 align:middle line:84%
and at home he
studies by candlelight

00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:07.930 align:middle line:90%
to stay awake to do it.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:08.929 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:35:08.929 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:84%
They get to school,
they get there,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
they leave their house
early, they get home late.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:90%
They have to do chores.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They have to help.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they're doing their
studies by candlelight.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's another
woman here, Susan.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
picture of you with her.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And I love the story.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:90%
She was the 41st girl.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So basically, so we helped
fund the first secondary school

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:90%
in this particular area.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's grades?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Secondary
is nine through 12.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:90%
So primary is K through eight.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so Susan, just to kind of go
back a little bit of her story,

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
there's two times in her life
where her life was really

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:90%
saved by the help of a stranger.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The first time was
when she was born.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And her mother did what,
probably the kindest thing

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that she could do
based on her resources.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And instead of abandoning
her in a field where

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:08.610 align:middle line:84%
she would be killed, she took
her to a community marketplace

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and left her there in the hopes
that somebody would find her.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So here's Susan, this
little teeny baby, days old.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And Monica is a mother
of eight children.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And she sees this baby
crying in the marketplace,

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and she picks up the
baby, she holds the baby.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.127 align:middle line:90%
And she takes her home.

00:36:29.127 --> 00:36:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, she doesn't have the money.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't have the space.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:90%
But what's she gonna do?

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:90%
So she takes the baby home.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Every single week,
she brings Susan,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the baby, back to
the marketplace,

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:90%
hoping to find her mom.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.060 align:middle line:90%
She never does.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, she doesn't
have the room.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't have the resources.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But she decided that Susan
would be her ninth child.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And Monica was an
amazing, empowered woman.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So even though the situation
with the women in the Maasai

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Mara-- you know, not that
many people who are women

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:90%
are able to actually leave.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:90%
They're stuck in that cycle.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But she told every
one of her children

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that they could do
whatever they really

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
dreamed that they could do
and that education is the key.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So Susan was raised
with that and believed

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that she was going
to work really hard,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and she had this dream
to become a doctor.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.204 align:middle line:90%
So she's top at her field.

00:37:21.204 --> 00:37:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's great
that she had a dream.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: She had
a dream, seriously.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And so she's studying hard,
she's getting great grades,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and she is just really
hoping that when

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
it's time to apply to go
to Kisaruni High School

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:90%
that she's accepted.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is
for that first year,

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:84%
there was only
room for 40 girls.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a boarding school.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So the first, you know, the
ninth grade year, 40 beds,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:90%
40 desks, 40 chairs, 40 girls.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.227 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do
those girls get in?

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:51.959 align:middle line:90%
How do they choose the 40?

00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, they do tests.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're testing them, and
they do interviews and things

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:90%
So they all studied.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Susan was a little
apprehensive but confident.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And the very last day
of primary school,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:90%
they all got their results.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And Susan found out that
she was not accepted.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.799 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And she was
devastated, because she knew--

00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was her dream.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: That's
her dream, and guess

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.431 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean--
she's not going

00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to continue
to go to school.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
She'll end up getting married,
and the cycle just continues.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So when the next school year
began, Susan could not-- like,

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.390 align:middle line:90%
she couldn't sleep.

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't let it go.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So she goes when this
classroom starts again.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, she
sees these 40 little girls

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:84%
in their uniforms,
and she's devastated.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And as she got closer,
the teacher and the girls

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:84%
could see that Susan is walking
to the class, to their school.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher said,
why are you here?

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And Susan said,
I heard about it.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.450 align:middle line:90%
I had to hear it for myself.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher said, I'm sorry,
but you were the 41st girl.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.379 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:39:03.379 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And she said
she felt like-- one girl.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:84%
She felt like somebody just
punched her in the stomach.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she
tried to be strong

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and she tried to be brave,
but of course the tears

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:90%
started flowing.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And the little
girls were shocked

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because they knew if it weren't
for them being in school,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:90%
they would be just like Susan.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is the girls
surrounded Susan, just like,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:90%
you know, holding her up.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the girls
said, don't send her way.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We will move our beds together.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:90%
We'll share our desks.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.447 align:middle line:90%
We'll share our books.

00:39:39.447 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.946 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:39:40.946 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Please let her stay.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And that year, because
not only of the support

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Unstoppable
Foundation that helped

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:84%
fund the school but people who
helped fund Susan's education,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:90%
she became the 41st girl.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And here she is now.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.902 align:middle line:84%
She's graduating
this year in January.

00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.985 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: And look at her.

00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, it goes back to
your question, Lisa,

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:84%
of what does education
mean for one child?

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:90%
It means everything.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like, now she's
going to continue.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She'll go to college,
which means so much to her.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: She'll go to college.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I do think
that it's admirable

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that you guys actually
tracked her story

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and you followed
her that closely

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and brought that story back,
because that means that you are

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in it, you are following
through, you are on the ground.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:90%
We see her every year.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So I met her when she was in the
ninth grade and the 10th grade.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very cool.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.451 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very cool.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
video here about believing.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.179 align:middle line:90%
So take a look.

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:41.012 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: OK, good.

00:40:41.012 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:90%
-I believe I can fly.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.890 align:middle line:90%
You want to know why?

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:90%
I've flown in an airplane.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.219 align:middle line:84%
I believe I can go to the
moon, because in school I

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:90%
learned about astronauts.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
every kid out there

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.090 align:middle line:84%
deserves to know
the things I know.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if every kid had
the chance to learn like me,

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure together
we can change the world.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.121 align:middle line:84%
I just had to find a way to
get the message out there.

00:41:33.121 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.212 align:middle line:90%
I hope they get the message.

00:41:45.212 --> 00:41:46.670 align:middle line:84%
-There are millions
of children who

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.319 align:middle line:84%
have a right to learn but
no way to be educated,

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
millions of children
who have a right

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to clean water, health care,
sound nutrition, and hope

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.040 align:middle line:84%
for a real future; millions of
children with the same needs

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:90%
and rights as you and me.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They're just waiting for
the world to get the message

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:08.140 align:middle line:90%
and then do something about it.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:90%
One message from me.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:90%
One message from you.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.950 align:middle line:90%
One simple message.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Until we've made sure that
every girl and boy gets

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to learn and to
dream, until we've

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
change the world by changing
the lives of its children,

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.028 align:middle line:90%
we will not stop.

00:42:30.028 --> 00:42:34.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We are Unstoppable.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Join us.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.727 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.727 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so you have
been at this for six years,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and you've done an enormous
amount in six years.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I am really, really
happy about the fact

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that you share these
stories with us,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because we know that this
foundation goes directly

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to where it's needed,
which is amazing,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
which I love in
speaking with you.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:04.546 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Thank you.

00:43:04.546 --> 00:43:05.629 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I really see that.

00:43:05.629 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I see it in your eyes,
which is incredible,

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:84%
how much you love
and care about this.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So now you're starting
another level,

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:84%
where you're getting
it into social media.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:43:15.465 --> 00:43:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So basically, you
know, it took us five years.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
We've been at this
now six years,

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're educating
6,500 children a day.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A day?

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: A day.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.954 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And every time
I come back, Lisa, it's

00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
like-- from Kenya and
seeing these kids,

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:90%
it's like, I've got to do more.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.700 align:middle line:90%
We've got to kick it up.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: And to
give some context,

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.070 align:middle line:84%
it took us five years
to get to the level

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:90%
of 5,000 children a day.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when I came home
from Kenya a few months ago,

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing on Facebook
this Ice Bucket Challenge,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, you
know, what is this?

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And my initial idea was, I
hope I don't get challenged.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I thought
was I hope nobody-- please,

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:84%
don't challenge me, because
I don't want ice on my head.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But as I started--
continued to follow it,

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.922 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away by
what was happening.

00:44:03.922 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course I
did get challenged.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Mary Morrissey challenged me.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy to do
it, and I donated money.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest
thing I really got

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is witnessing what happens
when a lot of people

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:84%
come together and
do a little bit.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to me, it
shifted my paradigm.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That ice bucket
shifted my paradigm

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:84%
about what was possible
and how long it actually

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
takes to be able to
raise this kind of money.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So our initial idea and
goal was to do, in one year,

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to educate another 5,000
children, which is still

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:90%
a pretty aggressive goal.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.483 align:middle line:84%
But I saw that Ice
Bucket Challenge,

00:44:38.483 --> 00:44:39.858 align:middle line:84%
and I thought,
you know, we could

00:44:39.858 --> 00:44:43.661 align:middle line:84%
do this in five months
or even five weeks.

00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They did, didn't they?

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Well, they did.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they did in one month.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:90%
It took some time to build.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But after they were really
building, it took-- in 30 days,

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:90%
they raised $100 million.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And over 3 million
videos were created,

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and over 30 million
people were engaged

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
either liking it or
commenting on it.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those people
contributed to that success.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, true.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of social media.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:90%
It goes viral so fast.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It really can.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.049 align:middle line:90%
So what are you up to?

00:45:17.049 --> 00:45:17.840 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.424 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: So bottom line
is, we got inspired by that.

00:45:20.424 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of got
together and really started

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.200 align:middle line:84%
looking at how could
we create something

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that would be consistent
with who we are?

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And we kept hearing,
you know, the theme was

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
there are people
in our lives who,

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:84%
because of who they are
and their impact on us,

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.780 align:middle line:84%
has significantly impacted
where we are today.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And the overwhelming desire
to be able to thank them.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we came up with the idea
of the Unstoppable Hero Toast.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the concept
is really simple.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It's first off, you know,
grab your smartphone

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and toast your hero.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Raise a glass and toast
somebody in your life

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:84%
who has given to
you, who's believed

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:06.310 align:middle line:84%
in you, who's encouraged
you, pushed you.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So just raise a glass and
toast and acknowledge them.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Number two is to become a hero.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you do that
is kind of paying it forward.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like, thank you.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.680 align:middle line:84%
My hero-- I have many-- but
the one that I did the video on

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%
was Bob Proctor.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, thank you for
what you've done in my life.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And really to acknowledge
you and pay it forward,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I went to my own site, and I
am educating three children.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's $1 a day, so that's
$3 a day, $91 a month.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And those three kids are
getting an education,

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:84%
really I think, in
honor of Bob Proctor

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and really the influence
he's made in my life.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the third piece is that
we nominate three people, three

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:84%
colleagues, to toast
their hero and become

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.980 align:middle line:90%
a hero in the next 24 hours.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you-- you
have-- you toasted--

00:46:58.075 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take a
look here at the video.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.604 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
Cynthia toasting her hero.

00:47:03.604 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.290 align:middle line:84%
-Hi, I'm Cynthia Kersey with
the Unstoppable Foundation.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the
Unstoppable Hero Toast.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.002 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to share with you
this wonderful campaign that's

00:47:15.002 --> 00:47:16.210 align:middle line:90%
gonna make such a difference.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But before I give
you the details,

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you a little
bit about the back story.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The first week of
August, I just got back

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.410 align:middle line:84%
from visiting our
work in Kenya, where

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.940 align:middle line:84%
we met many of
the 6,000 children

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that are getting an
education, they're

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.750 align:middle line:84%
getting access to clean water,
health care, nutritious meal

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
every single day,
and their parents

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.110 align:middle line:84%
are learning to
generate an income, so

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that the entire program that
we're delivering to them

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.250 align:middle line:90%
will become self-sustaining.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:90%
So it was powerful.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:90%
It was inspiring.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet we left talking to
communities and parents who

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
were still waiting for their
children to get an education.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:90%
So on one hand, it's inspiring.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.120 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
it's heartbreaking.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So we came back even
more determined than ever

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to get more children educated
in this particular part

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of the world in the
sub-Sahara Africa.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So I get back and
I'm on Facebook,

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and I start hearing about
the Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And my initial
reaction was, you know,

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.052 align:middle line:84%
gosh, I hope I don't
get challenged,

00:48:18.052 --> 00:48:19.760 align:middle line:84%
because the last thing
I want is somebody

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.270 align:middle line:84%
to dump a bucket of
ice water on my head.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But as the days progressed and
actually the weeks progressed,

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I shifted, because I was blown
away by the amount of money

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of people that
were engaged in this campaign.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
in a 30-day period,

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.470 align:middle line:84%
at the height of this campaign,
they raised $100 million?

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:50.112 align:middle line:84%
The prior year, same time
period, $2.8 million.

00:48:50.112 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Over 2 and 1/2 million people
posted videos on Facebook,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and over 30 million people
were engaged in some level,

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:84%
even if they were just
liking it or writing

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:90%
a comment on Facebook.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I
really got about that

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is what happens when you
give somebody an easy way

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to support a cause that's fun,
that certainly it was funny,

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.370 align:middle line:90%
it was shocking.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.780 align:middle line:90%
But people innately care.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
you know, there's

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:29.430 align:middle line:84%
no reason why we can't, as an
Unstoppable community, come up

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.990 align:middle line:84%
with something that's
fun, that's engaging,

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and that will help us
educate the next 5,000

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:39.800 align:middle line:84%
children in a fraction
of the amount of time.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So I called some supporters
with Unstoppable.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:84%
We all came together, and
we started brainstorming.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
common thread that I

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.760 align:middle line:84%
heard from every single
person was that they all

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:84%
had somebody who believed
in them, who supported them,

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.390 align:middle line:84%
even prodded them to
step up in their life.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling of
overwhelming gratitude.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And their desire just to
acknowledge this person.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how
the Unstoppable Hero

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Toast was born.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
concept is three steps.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Number one, toast your hero.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.710 align:middle line:90%
So pour your favorite beverage.

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It could be a Starbucks latte.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It could be a sparkling water.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It could be a glass of
champagne or some concoction

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that you create--
it doesn't matter.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Raise a glass and publicly
acknowledge your hero--

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that person who spent time
with you, that person who

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
believed in you,
and because of that,

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you are who you are
fundamentally today,

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:90%
because they were a hero to you.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
toast your hero.

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you're
going to become a hero.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you
can become a hero

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is to donate money
to help educate

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:84%
a child through the
Unstoppable Foundation.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It's $1 a day.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't care if you donate
$1; you're making a difference.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're helping us
create this viral campaign

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.330 align:middle line:84%
so that other people can
be able to toast their hero

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and become a hero as well.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So step number three is you
nominate three friends to toast

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.590 align:middle line:84%
their hero and become a hero
as well on a video, right,

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and just share it
with other people.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's really the concept.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And just by
participating in this,

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:84%
we're hoping to
build more awareness

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and by the end of the
year raise the money

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to educate
another 5,000 children.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would-- I encourage
every single one of you,

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:49.390 align:middle line:84%
take two minutes-- that's all
it'll take-- toast your hero.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Become a hero.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Pledge to become a hero by going
to unstoppablefoundation.org,

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.440 align:middle line:90%
making a donation.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
small or how large,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.660 align:middle line:90%
you're making a difference.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And then nominate three
friends to create their video,

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:09.860 align:middle line:84%
toast their hero, and
become a hero as well.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And together, we will
absolutely change

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the lives of 5,000--
at least 5,000 children

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and feel fantastic about
acknowledging our hero

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and also becoming a hero.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:25.470 align:middle line:90%
We're excited.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We can't wait to see your
toast and share with you

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:84%
the stories of the
children whose lives are

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.870 align:middle line:84%
changed because
you became a hero.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:34.537 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:34.537 --> 00:52:35.370 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
is basically easy.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us have
somebody that we admire

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.820 align:middle line:84%
or who has helped us in our
trajectory of our lives.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to do one,
because Wayne Dyer has been

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:50.030 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful inspiration
to me in so many ways

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and supported me
in so many ways.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's encouraged
me to write a book,

00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.494 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote the foreword
to it, with everything.

00:52:59.494 --> 00:53:00.785 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's a great hero.

00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:02.131 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So I will toast my hero.

00:53:02.131 --> 00:53:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want him to know that,
because I can't tell him enough

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.680 align:middle line:90%
how much he's helped me.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then make a contribution
towards the Unstoppable

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.397 align:middle line:84%
And then pay it forward
to three more people.

00:53:14.397 --> 00:53:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNTHIA: Nominating three
people to do the same thing,

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.037 align:middle line:84%
toast their hero
and become a hero.

00:53:19.037 --> 00:53:19.537 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:53:19.537 --> 00:53:20.491 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I got it.

00:53:20.491 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: Easy.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
is a huge initiative.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And you've already done so much.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that this
will catch on as well,

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:90%
because it is paying it forward.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.870 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing people
to be saying--

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
to be in gratitude,
first of all.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.529 align:middle line:84%
Then to contribute,
which we understand

00:53:38.529 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the benefits of giving, which
we don't even need benefits of.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.875 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: And even $1.

00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:46.067 align:middle line:84%
As simple as $1 will
educate a child for a day.

00:53:46.067 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's not an amount--
some people can give more,

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.066 align:middle line:90%
and some people can't.

00:53:49.066 --> 00:53:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's just the energetic of
saying, I want to be a hero.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to educate a child
for a day, a month, a year,

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.429 align:middle line:90%
whatever you can do.

00:53:57.429 --> 00:53:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then call
out three more people

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.990 align:middle line:84%
who I know that want
to be heroes as well.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: That's right.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:02.905 --> 00:54:03.405 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:03.405 --> 00:54:05.007 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: There you go.

00:54:05.007 --> 00:54:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.942 align:middle line:90%
You are such an inspiration.

00:54:07.942 --> 00:54:09.150 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:90%
You truly walk your talk.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And you have such a huge heart.

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.830 align:middle line:90%
You have a huge heart.

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA: You do, too.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.886 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a village
to sponsor a village

00:54:18.886 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and change the world.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.977 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
being a part of this

00:54:21.977 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and helping us spread
the world-- word

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.851 align:middle line:90%
and get more children educated.

00:54:24.851 --> 00:54:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel good to
be a part of it as well.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.549 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:84%
