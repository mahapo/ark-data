00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, and welcome.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.926 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:17.050 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you question.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to put
more of your focus

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:90%
on living a committed life?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, what does that mean?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:10%
Do issues like sustainability
and poverty and world hunger

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
seem like things that are
outside of your reach, that

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
are outside of your grasp?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:10%
Would you like to
know how you, how

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:10%
one person can
make a difference?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is someone who
really is making a difference.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Global activist and co-founder
of The Pachamama Alliance,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Lynne Twist.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.227 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with us.

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNNE TWIST: It's my
pleasure, my delight.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's our honor, truly.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Thank you.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.257 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what inspires you to
make a difference in humanity?

00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you just wake
up one day-- I mean,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
this has to be the root
of who you really are.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I think it's
the root of who everybody is.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I'm
unique in that way.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:10%
I think it lives like a burning
yearning for every human being.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.374 align:middle line:10%
And if you just remember
when you were a child

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:14.415 align:middle line:10%
and you found out that
other children were hungry

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
or you found out
that there was war,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:10%
you wanted to do
something about it.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.699 align:middle line:84%
Every little child does unless
they're in those circumstances,

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and even then they want
to do something about it.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But people get
disconnected from it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
by feeling that it's
out of reach, that it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.417 align:middle line:84%
too daunting, that they can't do
anything just being one person.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard that?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I've heard
that a million times

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
if I've heard it once.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think what stops us is
this kind of very uniquely

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
human conversation that we
can't make a difference,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that we don't matter, that
our lives are too small.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
about history,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
when you think about
any monumental change

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
or transformation in history,
it was caused, it was fomented,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
it was inspired by a
regular human being

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:90%
who took an extraordinary stand.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's available to
everybody alive today.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many ways
to live your life in a way

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that you're fulfilled
and you know

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
that your life has meaning.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's really from
getting involved

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.074 align:middle line:84%
in something that
makes your heart sing

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's bigger than
your life starring you.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Who are
some of your idols

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that really made a difference
in history, that inspired you?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I
think all of us were

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:90%
inspired by Mahatma Gandhi.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.196 align:middle line:84%
I've been lucky enough to
live and work in India for,

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
off and on, for many years.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I never lived
there, but I worked

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
there are over 18 years
for the Hunger Project.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And Gandhi's legacy is
so huge for everybody

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:90%
in India but all over the world.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
His phrases, "my life is
my message," "be the change

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
you wish to make in the
world," that's Gandhi.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
He was an iconic of
making a difference.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
A little individual,
little brown man

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
who really changed
the course of history.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Martin Luther King, of course.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
People who are alive
today like Jane Goodall,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
people like Marian Wright
Edelman, Nelson Mandela,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Desmond Tutu, the Nobel
women laureates are--

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm privileged to
work with the Nobel's.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And I have the great
honor of knowing

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Jody Williams and
Rigoberta Menchu Tum.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I find people who are in
that category of-- we kind of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
revere them.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
When you actually
get to know them,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
it's just like talking to you,
it's just like talking to me.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
They're just people
who had the-- they're

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
ordinary people, really
ordinary people, who

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
made an extraordinary choice
and extraordinary commitment.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it generates an
extraordinary life.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is that
the defining moment?

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that changes a person

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
from wanting to
make a difference

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and actually making
a difference.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think that fine
line or that changing moment

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:90%
occurs?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:90%
In a person.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, there's-- that's
such a good question and I wish

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I could give a formula, but
I don't think there is one.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I think part of
it, I know for me,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
was paying attention
to the openings

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and pathways that life presents
you to make a difference.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And not turning away from them
or not being afraid of them.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's in the way we listen to
what the universe brings to us.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's in the way we
think about who we are

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and how we kind of
show up for ourselves.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky,
very, very lucky,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to meet some extraordinary
people in my lifetime,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to see if I
could just be a little bit more

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
like them.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I ended up being
more like myself.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And so mentors and role models
are really powerful for people.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And especially if they're people
who kind of bring you back

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to the power of
your own commitment,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
your own life story,
your own capacities,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.956 align:middle line:84%
your own qualities of
love and commitment.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
function of love, frankly.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I think everything's
a function of love.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing to let
yourself love the world,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
love other people,
love being alive,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of miraculous
things show up in your path

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
opportunity to step into it.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So not seeing
yourself as separate

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or as us versus them or as I'm
afraid that that could be me

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to talk
to that homeless person.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.267 align:middle line:84%
That concept, turning
that into love and--

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and sharing.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.361 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the word compassion
really means with passion.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So I remember I had
a little experiment

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I did for myself when the
homeless issue started

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to really enter into
my consciousness.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:90%
In a way I was irritated.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I noticed I was irritated
by homeless people.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I didn't want
them to talk to me.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.645 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of in my way and
they were kind of intrusive.

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I did a practice for Lent--
I was raised a Catholic,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't really practice
Catholicism any longer--

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
but Lent came and I kind of
thought, oh, I should do Lent.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Because this wonderful
teacher mine,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Brother David Steindl-Rast,
an Austrian monk,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
had just been staying
at my home and we'd

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:90%
done some work together.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And he took me to
Ash Wednesday mass,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
which I hadn't gone to
since I was like two,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and I had this ash
thing on my forehead.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.764 align:middle line:90%
And then he left that day.

00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
that day I decided,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.471 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do Lent this year.

00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And so for 40 days I did
a whole group of practices

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
but one of them was that every
homeless person in my path,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I was going to talk to, I was
going to physically touch,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to contribute
to, not necessarily

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
financially, but actually have
them feel seen, respected,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and give them a sense
of their own dignity.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And I did it for 40 days.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, if you
ever do something like that,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it changes your life forever
about people you're afraid of,

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
people you think are
untouchable or unpresentable

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
or will somehow be
dangerous to you.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it shifted everything.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So I do think there is practices
we can do that kind of open up

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
our heart, that close down
that judgemental little voice

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:90%
in our head.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you do something
like that, what happens

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:90%
is you get transformed.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
You start realizing
your own power

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and the power of your
capacity to love.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And everything really
good in the world

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
really comes from
there, I think.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it changed and
shifted who you were being

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and your thoughts around that.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And that's not
why I did it but I--

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --ended
up making it-- I

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
think I made a big difference
with all these people too.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I hope.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: But certainly
what happened

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
for me was, I'd call
it a transformation.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now fast forward to
what I had mentioned earlier.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You are the co-founder of
The Pachamama Alliance.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.459 align:middle line:90%
Which is enormous.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
a lot about that, but how

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
did you get to that
place where you

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.385 align:middle line:90%
co-founded an entire movement?

00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Well--

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.815 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big step.

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I just want to say,
it wasn't like I woke up one

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.357 align:middle line:84%
morning and said, oh,
let's co-found a movement--

00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.439 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --with
my husband, Bill.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:10%
It's really very similar
to what I'm describing.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:10%
We-- I was very involved
in-- and actually

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:10%
one of the key
leaders-- of something

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:10%
called the Hunger Project.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And I was working
all over the world

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:10%
in India, Bangladesh,
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:10%
places like Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Ethiopia, Angola, Namibia.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:10%
I was responsible for
operations in 47 countries.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very, very deeply
and profoundly committed

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
to ending world hunger.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was deeply
engaged in doing so.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.566 align:middle line:84%
And I had three
children and I had--

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you were a mom.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I was a mom and I had
a husband who was in business

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and kind of needed me to be
at his side from time to time.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.165 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- already I was
stretched to the absolute max

00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:42.395 align:middle line:90%
as most women know.

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
the way women are

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.186 align:middle line:84%
these days,
particularly women who

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
have professional commitments
or philanthropic commitments

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.401 align:middle line:90%
and kids.

00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So I did not
have one free iota, not

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
one free psychic minutia
space for anything more.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Yet, at the same time, while
I was really deeply devoted

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to my work in sub-Saharan
Africa, India and Bangladesh,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I got a very powerful
invitation to help a friend out

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in-- who was running an
organization in Guatemala

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
with my colleague
John Perkins who

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is a very well known
bestselling author

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.729 align:middle line:84%
and has also been
trained as a shaman,

00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
was in the Peace
Corps for many years

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
in Ecuador and the Amazon.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And he and I ended
up in Guatemala

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
with a whole lot of
things that preceded that,

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but we ended up in
a shamanic ceremony

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
with a great shaman, a really
great shaman, a Mayan shaman.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that shamanic ceremony--
it was my first ever,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:90%
this was in 1994.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'd worked with many
people in different cultures,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd never been in a
shamanic ceremony before

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never worked in Central
and Latin America or South

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And the shamanic ceremony
was in the middle

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of the night with a big
fire and we were lying down

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:84%
in the fire with our
feet towards the fire.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The shaman, with John's help,
was drumming and chanting.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And with John's
help in translation,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.411 align:middle line:90%
asked us to journey.

00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know what that was

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
but I knew it had something
to do with closing your eyes.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.765 align:middle line:84%
So I did and the night
air and the crackling

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
of the fire and the
shaman's chanting,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
his mesmerizing voice, and this
drum beat just transported me.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel my arms
turn into gigantic wings.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't my imagination;
it was happening.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't open my eyes because
I became completely hypnotized

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
by this incredible
space we were in.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And my arms turned into
these gigantic wings,

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a large curved
beak grow on my face.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And with sort of a
miraculous next moment,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I was flying over a
vast unending forest

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:90%
of green in slow motion.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was a giant
bird and I could

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
see all the way through
the top of the trees,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
through the canopy
to the forest floor

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.779 align:middle line:84%
and see little creatures running
around on the forest floor.

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I was flying over this
vast unending forest of green

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that went forever,
these disembodied faces

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
of men with orange
geometric face paint

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and yellow, red and black
feather crowns on their heads

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
started floating
up from the forest

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:90%
floor towards me, the bird.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were speaking in
a strange tongue and kind

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of calling to this bird, calling
in a kind of plaintiff call

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:90%
to the bird.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming at
me-- now, I'm the bird.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
understand the voices

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
or what they were saying.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
As they floated back
down into the forest,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
these faces with these
geometric face paint.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for I
have no idea how long.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like time stopped, it
was endless, I was this bird.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard a loud, like
a drumbeat, a loud drumbeat.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, oh,
I'm in Guatemala,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm in charge of this
group, I'm a human being.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Present time.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And I sat
up and felt my arms.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They were just as they had been.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And my face.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around
the circle-- and this

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle the night,
now, dark as can be--

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and the fire had burned
all the way down.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So I could see the
shaman across the embers.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.029 align:middle line:84%
And all the people
in the circle were

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
kind of like coming out
of some sort of a trance.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.312 align:middle line:84%
It was really,
really awesome, Lisa.

00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Powerful.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It was incredible.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.167 align:middle line:84%
And so each person
shared as best they could

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
what had happened to them.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And everyone had become some
sort of an animal except

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.372 align:middle line:84%
for one person who'd fallen
asleep and dreamt of her

00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
grandchildren,
which is, I thought,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
what I was going
to do but I didn't.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And then when it was
my turn, I shared

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
with the shaman, which
was his request, what

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I've just shared with you.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.635 align:middle line:84%
And he looked across at me with
a kind of strange, weird look.

00:12:53.635 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of strange,
weird looking person anyway.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.742 align:middle line:84%
Kind of strange and the
fire underneath his face.

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And then it went all the
way around the circle.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And then it went to
my friend John Perkins

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
who had spent many, many
years working in the Amazon.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And John had had an-- also had
a vision very similar to mine.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the shaman heard
John speak and went back

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to what I said, he then
completed the ritual

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and asked the two of us to stay
and everybody else departed.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And John, who had
told me, really,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
for several years about the
Achuar people in the Ecuadorian

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Amazon who he knew
at some point were

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
going to be calling for contact,
knew that this was the call.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That this was the
time, that we were

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
being called to meet with
the Achuar people who

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
had almost no contact
with the outside world

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and were ready for contact.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it came through
you in that moment.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: And John I would say.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.939 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of different
signs that I could talk about.

00:13:57.939 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Synchronicities--

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.896 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that
lined up around it.

00:14:00.896 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Made it clear
that we needed to go.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
a beautiful story

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of what a real true
calling is like.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So then everything after
that lined up perfectly

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.321 align:middle line:84%
and according to the
vision without your trying.

00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I must
say, I couldn't figure out

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:90%
how to do that.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I was running this
giant Hunger Project

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.764 align:middle line:90%
movement in 47 countries--

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Already.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --and I went directly
from Guatemala to Ghana

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to a board meeting with our
Ghanaian board in Ghana.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting around
a table in a hotel,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
in a hotel meeting room--
three women and five men

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and then myself--
all Ghanaian people

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
with blue black skin,
beautiful people.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're having this
wonderful conversation

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
about the work of the
Hunger Project in Ghana--

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:84%
we're in Accra, the capital
city-- and the men are talking

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and in a flash,
suddenly they started

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to have orange geometric face
paint appear on their faces,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:90%
on their blue black faces.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From what you saw?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: In Africa.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, my God, I've
just gone completely nuts.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was
talking about this.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.454 align:middle line:84%
It would be as if you
had something growing out

00:15:10.454 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
of your cheek and we
just kept talking as if--

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All of a sudden.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --it wasn't happening.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I got shaken and
I excused myself and went

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to the ladies' room, came back,
everybody was still talking,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
everything was fine, and
then it happened again.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I really burst into
tears, I started shaking.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Everyone asks me what's wrong.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I think
I'm very sick and I

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
need to go back to
the United States.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I was sick.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was hallucinating.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And perhaps I was, who knows.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up going to the
airport, getting on a plane,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and all the way back
to San Francisco

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:90%
I saw these same faces.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether my eyes
were open or shut.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I
really returned home

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and-- with John Perkins and I--
we realized, we've got to go.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
We put together a group
of 12 people, which

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%
is what the Achuar asked for.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.466 align:middle line:84%
People with open hearts,
people with global voice,

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
people who know
the rainforest is

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
critical to the
future of life, people

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
who know that great
wisdom is coming

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
from the shamans of
today, and people

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
who knew that indigenous wisdom
is critical for our survival.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And we traveled down
to South America,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to Quito, the
capital of Ecuador,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
down the Valley
of the Volcanoes,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
over the eastern
side of the Andes,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
down the Pastaza River canyon--
if you can picture all this.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.993 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually
have some video of that.

00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But what a beautiful
story of a true calling.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But then how you take
action on a calling

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and not just deny it and go back
into the cave or the darkness

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
or routine or whatever
you could do to numb it.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But what it really
means to follow.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
with the viewers of what

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:90%
transpired as a result of that.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip from the
"Awakening the Dreamer" video,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.481 align:middle line:84%
and it shows a little bit
about what this mission is

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
so that people can
really understand that.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.745 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Great.

00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:57.864 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:16:57.864 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1995, a call issued
forth from the heart

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of the natural world that
was heard thousands of miles

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
away by a small group of
people in the modern world.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of that
year, in a remote village

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:84%
in the rainforest, these
two worlds came together.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Pachamama
Alliance was born.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:10%
>>From the very beginning,
our indigenous partners

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.242 align:middle line:10%
told us that it was
really, really great

00:17:26.242 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:10%
that we were working with
them in the Amazon shoulder

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:10%
to shoulder.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:10%
But that was only
half the battle.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:10%
They told us that
if we really wanted

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:10%
to protect their
lands permanently,

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:10%
we would need to go to work
in our part of the world.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And as they put
it, we would need

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to change the
dream of the north,

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
the dream of the modern world.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
A dream rooted in
consumption and acquisition,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
without any regard
to the consequences

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:84%
to the natural world
or even our own future.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:10%
>>Changing the dream
of the modern world

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:10%
is certainly a daunting
and some would even

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:10%
say an impossible task.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:10%
But we took the request of
the Achuar very seriously.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Out of our work
with them, we came

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:10%
to see that we in
the modern world

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:10%
truly are in some kind
of a trance, living

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:10%
in a dream that's
threatening to destroy

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:10%
not only the rainforest
and their way of life,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:10%
but the health and well
being of our entire planet.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Our society is on a
completely unsustainable path,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and experts
everywhere are saying

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
that we have a limited
time to turn things around.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>>So in response
to the request that

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:10%
came from its
indigenous partners,

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:10%
the Pachamama Alliance
created this symposium,

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:10%
Awakening the Dreamer,
Changing the Dream.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:10%
Now being offered by
thousands of volunteers

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:10%
in dozens of countries
around the world.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the symposium
is an audacious one,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
bringing forth an
environmentally sustainable,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
socially just human presence

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.155 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.155 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:10%
>>The intention is
that, by the end,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:10%
rather than seeing these
as three separate issues,

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:10%
you see them as
interrelated facets of one

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:10%
profoundly interconnected whole.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that you not only
understand the scope and urgency

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary
situation we face,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
but you also see that the
possibility of our times

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.835 align:middle line:90%
is greater than the crisis.

00:19:35.835 --> 00:19:41.247 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that entire video
inspired a movement, basically,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that created then a
symposium, a class, that

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.569 align:middle line:90%
was done here at Gaiam.

00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it says in
the video, we really

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
got the message from
the indigenous people

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that the real work--
obviously they

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
wanted us to stand with them
to protect their forests.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
great statements is

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we're committed to
preserving the world's

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
tropical rainforest,
but by empowering

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous people who
are its natural custodians.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's very
clear that what's

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
putting pressure
on the ecosystems--

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
particularly the rainforests
but on all ecosystems--

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.922 align:middle line:84%
is the dream or trance
of the modern world which

00:20:24.922 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is, it said in the
video, is really

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
where Pachamama
has gone to work.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And this program, the Awakening
the Dream or Changing the Dream

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
symposium now has many forms.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.645 align:middle line:84%
One of them is this wonderful
live TV-- television Gaiam

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:40.145 align:middle line:90%

I guess it's not live.

00:20:41.856 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It was live and now it's video.

the symposium in 62 countries
in something like 16 languages.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a three,
four hour experience live.

It can be an hour and a
half, it can be two days.

all that can be found

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.161 align:middle line:90%

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Absolutely.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.124 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then this-- what does
Pachamama, by the way, mean?

00:21:13.124 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
What is the name,
Pachamama, mean?

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, the word
pachamama, first of all,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:90%
is from the Quechua people.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The Quechua people, the largest
indigenous language group

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And they live in the
Andes and in the Amazon.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And the word pachamama
means mother earth.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Pacha mama.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But to Quechua people, they
would say the earth, the sky,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:90%
the universe, and all time.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Because indigenous people
live in a very large cosmology

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.607 align:middle line:84%
about reality, much more-- they
see much more than this chair.

00:21:40.607 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
They see the spirit of
the chair, et cetera.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So it means the earth, the
sky, the universe and all time.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pachamama
Alliance is an alliance

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
between indigenous peoples
of the Amazon and the Andes

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and conscious committed people
in the modern world like you

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and me.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably
everybody who's watching this.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.314 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And
inspiring, of course,

00:21:58.314 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
people on how they can
change and make a difference.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.392 align:middle line:84%
So you talked about that
trance of the modern world.

00:22:03.392 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We've been touching on
that throughout the show

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
because it-- the further
and further we get away

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.784 align:middle line:84%
from the Amazon and
these indigenous people,

00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and the more that we get
into our modern world

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
with the modern conveniences and
convenience stores and packaged

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
foods and all that goes
along with our modern world,

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
it takes people like
you to bring us back

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
into that consciousness
and movements

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
like this to bring us back
into that consciousness.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So, actually there's another
clip that I want people to see,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and this has to do
with what that means.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
What it actually means
to reconnect to--

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.329 align:middle line:84%
You called it
unexamined assumptions.

00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.453 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that is so beautiful

00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:44.209 align:middle line:84%
about indigenous peoples,
and our indigenous partners

00:22:44.209 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
in particular, is they
don't make us wrong.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I like it.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I love that.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.571 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:48.571 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: What they see is
that we're in a trance.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They're not in it, so they
can see that we're in it.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they are--
see that their role is

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is to help us to wake
up from the trance

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:90%
before it takes us off a cliff.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the trance
is actually made up

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of unconscious,
unexamined assumptions.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a misunderstanding
of our place in the world.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not-- we're
not flawed as a species,

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:90%
we're really merely mistaken.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
We've isolated
ourselves as a species

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and we have unconscious
assumptions like, for example,

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
when you throw something
away, where is away?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.337 align:middle line:90%
There's no such place.

00:23:28.337 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.919 align:middle line:90%
Where does it really go?

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: We've created
an unconscious assumption

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that there is an away.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:90%
But there isn't.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Even in space now is
cluttered with debris.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So to actually let go of
an unconscious unexamined

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
assumption like
there is an away,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.937 align:middle line:84%
is a very profound way of
shifting your relationship

00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:90%
with the world around you.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.895 align:middle line:90%
So that's an example.

00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:50.019 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a lot more.

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I want actually to see--
want you see this clip again

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:90%
from "Awakening the Dreamer."

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:58.168 align:middle line:84%
It talks all about
unconscious assumptions.

00:23:58.168 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>According to Thomas
Berry, our industrial age

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
could be characterized
as a period

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of technological entrancement
in which our obsession

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
progress has us marching toward
an ill-defined magical paradise

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in the future.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
A future in which we
have mastered the Earth

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and everything on it
without any limits.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be said
that we in the modern world

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:90%
are living in a kind of trance.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.135 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous people
would call this trance

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:90%
the dream of the modern world.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:10%
This dream could also be
called our current worldview,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:10%
a way of seeing the world we're
not even aware that we have.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:10%
A worldview is held
in place by a set

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:10%
of beliefs and
unexamined assumptions

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:10%
that we're completely
unaware of.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.835 align:middle line:10%
Like glasses we've worn
so long we don't even

00:24:50.835 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:10%
know we're looking
through them anymore.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:10%
People's actions correlate
with their worldview.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:10%
We take actions consistent
with how we see the world.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And often those actions
produce outcomes

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
we didn't predict or intend.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So when our actions produce
outcomes we're not intending,

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
it's important to identify
the unconscious unexamined

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
assumptions that generated those
actions in the first place.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%

>>All the crises
we're facing today

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as the
unintended result

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.850 align:middle line:84%
of the unexamined
assumptions that

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.084 align:middle line:84%

six water bottles a day--
plastic water bottles-- I mean,

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:90%
really sort of unconsciously.

But when I took--
when we started

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:84%
developing the symposium, and
we actually did the research

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and found out that
in the United States

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%

back at my own behavior

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.297 align:middle line:84%

never, if I can help it--

00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to-- take a plastic
bottle of any kind.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
about that island,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I think about that
600 million, and I

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
think about the fact
that just me in one

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%

water bottles a day

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%

water bottles from just one

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you find
that out-- and I

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.298 align:middle line:84%
was in a meeting in New
York-- I'll never forget it--

00:27:25.298 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and there was this really
cool guy from Germany.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could remember
his last name because he

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
was-- made such
difference to me.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:90%
His name is Siggy.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were-- it was
at the Tibet House

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and we were having lunch.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing some
consulting because I

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
do fundraising consulting and
organizational development

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:90%
consulting sometimes.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was time
for lunch and they

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
brought in all this
wonderful food.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And Siggy would not allow
anyone to take a water bottle.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to just
announce that anybody here

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.942 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't know, we
should not be drinking out

00:27:58.942 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of water bottles.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And please take those away and
bring us a pitcher of water

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:90%
and put it in a glass.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- it was so
brave of him to do that.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:90%
But then he explained.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And everybody from then on
from that little gathering

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
actually had a more
conscious relationship

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:90%
with plastic bottles.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe they don't all never
take another plastic bottle,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
but every one of us can
do something like that

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:90%
without making anyone wrong.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:90%
But just awaken.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.087 align:middle line:90%
Did you know?

00:28:25.087 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And then things
like, for the environment,

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
we all know that it's really
better to buy local food

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:90%
if you can.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.525 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't always do that,
but if you're eating something

00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that comes all the way from
France or an Evian bottle,

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you could say, or let's
just say something

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that gets imported from
Australia or New Zealand,

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a kiwi,
when you could buy

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.237 align:middle line:84%
one that was grown 100
miles away or 50 miles away.

00:28:56.237 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: You think about how
much petroleum and air travel

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and packaging and-- it takes to
get that little kiwi from New

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.959 align:middle line:84%
Zealand to your table
in San Francisco,

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and you start
thinking, well, I don't

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:90%
think I want to do that anymore.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll just look in
my store, where's

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:90%
the locally grown food--

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just to be aware of it.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --and if they don't
have it I'll mention that

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.426 align:middle line:84%
to the grocer and then I'll--
I'll say I'm going to go

00:29:18.426 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to Whole Foods until you have
that section because I know

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.286 align:middle line:90%
they do that.

00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:22.661 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll go to this
grocery store.

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I saw this.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought about how far
away we have gotten.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.119 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this
billboard on the way

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:29.660 align:middle line:84%
to dropping my
daughter off to school

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was a governmental,
I think, health agency.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it said something
about-- it was

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:84%
this little child
eating watermelon.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And it said, tell them
it's astronaut food.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Whatever works.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
far away have we

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
gotten that we need to tell
kids that eating a watermelon

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:90%
is astronaut food?

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just tell
them it's a watermelon?

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Why did we have to say
that as a campaign?

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:84%
That we've gotten so conditioned
by the plastics and the foods

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about
the awareness.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The billboard was
just shocking to me

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that that's now a
marketing campaign.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's about getting back
to-- so when you go back

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to the Amazon, when you go
back to the indigenous people

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.939 align:middle line:84%
there-- and you go
back often, don't you?

00:30:13.939 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes, I do.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And I take people there, too.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
take people there.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I'll take
you if you want to go.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.601 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my God.

00:30:18.601 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:90%
That's an honor to go with you.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So do you bring this
experience back to the people

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
there and say, well,
this is what we've done?

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it making an impact,
is really my question?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, yes, is the
answer to that question.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I need to embellish because
when people go on a Pachamama

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Alliance journey, or go to the
Amazon with us, in particular,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and go to this very remote area,
what you really get from that

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
is you get in touch
with something

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know you can
get in touch with it--

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are other
ways-- but you actually

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
have a relationship
with plants and animals

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:90%
like they're your kin.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the indigenous
people, they

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
see the giant otter
as their brother

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and the harpy eagle
as their uncle,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and they see the ayahuasca
plant or the medicinal plants

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
or the teaching plants or the
food plants as their relations.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And they don't live in the
forest off all this stuff.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
They are of the forest and they
live in the community of life

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:90%
with all their kin.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that you
and I are going to probably

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:90%
do that a lot this lifetime.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But it changes your very
way of seeing the world.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And plus, they have a
real dignity and respect

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
with their ancestors and
with all future generations.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So you start to realize, oh, I'm
the current blossom on the tree

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:84%
of life from the
lineage that I come from

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm passing it onto your
daughter or my children,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and to do the best job I
can with this period of life

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:90%
that I've been given to live.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking of yourself
beyond your own lifetime.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And really, almost
everybody does that.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.156 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:32:02.156 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're a part of
a much, much bigger whole.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: A bigger story.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.973 align:middle line:84%
And instead of what's
right in front of you,

00:32:06.973 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:84%
all these little petty
worries, they start to diminish

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have you.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't grip
you like they did.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's really healthy
for your own consciousness

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and your own peace of mind.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little bit
more about the ayahuasca plant.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned
that it had-- it's

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.895 align:middle line:84%
meaning to the indigenous people
and what your experience is.

00:32:24.895 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
If you could share with us
a little bit about that.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.103 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot about it.

00:32:28.103 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well,
ayahuasca is-- or natem,

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.149 align:middle line:84%
is how the Achuar which
is the primary indigenous

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:90%
group we work with.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.565 align:middle line:84%
We work with all the
indigenous groups,

00:32:35.565 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
but that's the
word that they use.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Is a teaching plant.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And its their most sacred,
most revered teacher.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a drug, it's
not done in a laboratory,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:90%
it's not a bunch of chemicals.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a plant.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And the shamans prepare
it with great reverence.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's-

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's ceremonial.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.231 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:32:56.231 --> 00:32:58.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a ceremonial experience.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
the people who you

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
work with when you
ingest the kind of brew

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.880 align:middle line:90%
that they make out of the plant.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
this will never

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.240 align:middle line:84%
become a recreational activity
because it makes you very sick.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It makes you purge.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
We would, in our culture,
we would say vomit.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But they call it
purging, cleansing

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
your body of all the
ills, of the toxins.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And not the toxins
only that come

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.230 align:middle line:84%
from our food but
the toxins that

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
come from the newspaper, that
come from television, that

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:84%
come from our doubts
about ourselves.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
do-- most people--

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.237 align:middle line:90%
purge quite dramatically.

00:33:38.237 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Extensively.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.653 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:33:39.653 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what
I would call fun.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it goes
the other way also.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And not every single
person, but it's

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.810 align:middle line:84%
almost like that's
part of what makes

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:84%
it so humbling to
interact with the plant.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the plant,
then-- they call

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:84%
her a mother-- she
does come to you.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And she-- you see
things, you can

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.364 align:middle line:84%
see the-- it depends
on the person,

00:34:04.364 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very
personal-- but sometimes

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
veins and the blood

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
running through your
own hand or your body.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:84%
You can see inside
of a leaf, you

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:84%
see patterns in the sky that
you didn't know were there,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.785 align:middle line:84%
you actually have
visions of animals

00:34:18.785 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even
know what they are.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll see anacondas,
you might see jaguars,

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll sometimes see
the face of a shaman.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It sounds very trippy
and dramatic, and it is,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.060 align:middle line:84%
but I just want to talk about
it with a real reverence.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.656 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:33.656 --> 00:34:35.239 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Because for
indigenous people

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and doing it in the
rainforest with them--

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.429 align:middle line:90%
which is a tremendous honor.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing this
for thousands of years

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
they receive all

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
of their prophetic information,
all of their profound wisdom.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
And these people,
although we would

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
call them primitive
in the way they live,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
are highly, highly
sophisticated in ways

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.419 align:middle line:90%
that we are quite primitive.

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they guide you
through the experience.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's the way
that really should be done.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I can't
say should really.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I kind of try to avoid
that word when possible.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But I invite people to consider
the possibility, let's say,

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:84%
that this is the most authentic
encounter with that teaching

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:90%
plant.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a central part of
the culture, of the teachings,

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:84%
for many of the
indigenous tribes.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have received tremendous
benefit ourself from them.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that much of
it has come from the plant.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it allows
you to see the earth

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.219 align:middle line:84%
as the mother would
see the earth?

00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.468 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In a way.

00:35:33.468 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: You actually-- yes.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say, she is who's
speaking through that plant.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
direct relationship

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.820 align:middle line:84%
with the being,
the Gaia-- here we

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
are at Gaiam-- the
actual Gaia spirit.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: She and you become in
a kind of collaborative oneness.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have heard that
is a life changing journey.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
That you don't ever
go back once you

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:84%
have that experience of
what you gain-- not gain,

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
but what you
experience and what you

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
learn changes who
you are for life.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, it
changes-- yes, it does.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.727 align:middle line:84%
It almost reveals who you
are rather than changes it.

00:36:14.727 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So I think the
real verb to use is reveals.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It unconceals who
you are to yourself.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And you start to realize
that you are an ecosystem.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never thought
of myself as an ecosystem

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
until I had an experience
with the plant ayahuasca.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And now I know I
am an ecosystem.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I live
in an ecosystem,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and you take care of
all this stuff out here.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am an ecosystem, I
am part of the ecosystem.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I'm
a biological being.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm a spirit in biological form.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I take from the ecological
resources around me

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and I give back to them.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And that puts you in right
relation with the communion

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and the community of life.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being what Thomas
Berry, the great cosmologist,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.290 align:middle line:90%
calls our species.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
He says that we've been
in species isolation

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and that we're so isolated from
other species we don't even

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
realize we're part of the
community of life, we're here,

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.620 align:middle line:84%
we think, to exploit and
use the community of life

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:90%
for our own gain.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And that has us in a
real fix as a species.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:84%
We may not be forever
welcome on this planet

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:90%
if we don't cut that out.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So the Earth's
going to be fine,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
but are we going
to be allowed to--

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On it.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --stay.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So I don't mean
to make us wrong.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:84%
That was-- indigenous
people would never do that.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But we've kind of lost our
relations and our relationship

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:84%
with the very thing that
supports life and supports us.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
destroying our own nest.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And none of us want to do that.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:90%
There is nobody--

00:37:59.310 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --who's
doing it on purpose.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intentionally.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: It's all based
in unconscious, unexamined

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.850 align:middle line:84%
assumptions that we
don't even realize

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:90%
we are doing damage with.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Just like I didn't
realize I was building

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.267 align:middle line:90%
an island in the Pacific Ocean--

00:38:13.267 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --with
my water bottles.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.366 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:38:15.366 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much around that.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And I really encourage people
to look that up online,

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.017 align:middle line:84%
to look at-- research
garbage patch and you'll see

00:38:22.017 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
there's three the
size of Te-- I mean,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
they're-- it's a problem that
every single human being is

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.592 align:middle line:90%
contributing to and can--

00:38:28.592 --> 00:38:29.175 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: And--

00:38:29.175 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --solve.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --unconciously.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Unconciously.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:90%
But when you wake up--

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can solve.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.064 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --you
just wouldn't think

00:38:34.064 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
about continuing to do that.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So that's why
a program like this

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and what Gaiam's doing and
that Gaiam TV is so important

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:84%
because I say that
when people know,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
when they're conscious,
when they wake up,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and if you also can provide
some pathways for action-- which

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.070 align:middle line:84%
is what you're asking me
to do and what the getting

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
into action workshop which is
also part of Pachamama does

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and what Bioneers does and what
many of the guests on your show

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.210 align:middle line:90%
do-- any action.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like,
get an action.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.421 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:39:05.421 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.294 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
have another clip

00:39:07.294 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that I want to play in just a
second about the story of stuff

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.767 align:middle line:84%
and how it gets
from one place to--

00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and the consciousness around it.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
ask you really quickly

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.155 align:middle line:90%
about the ayahuasca experience.

00:39:16.155 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that where you
had the invitation

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:84%
to create The
Pachamama Alliance?

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Was that--

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Well--

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --around that story?

00:39:24.716 --> 00:39:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Was that different?

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I have to say, yes.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't always
say that so publicly,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and here we are on television.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's true, yes, that
experience for Bill and I,

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.125 align:middle line:90%
when we--

00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:39.833 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And John.

00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --when I described
we went that very first time--

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and John Perkins who'd
participated with ayahuasca

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.609 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many years.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --many years.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.600 align:middle line:84%
That night was a turning
point in our lives.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know it at the
time, but we look back now

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and we can really see
there was something there.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't have
the time or the energy

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.837 align:middle line:84%
or the space to
start an organization

00:40:03.837 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that's become a global movement.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We weren't even
thinking about that.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We didn't speak Spanish, we'd
never been to South America,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.208 align:middle line:84%
we weren't even thinking
about the environment.

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.800 align:middle line:90%
We were totally clueless.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:90%
We were like a blank canvas.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.051 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:40:15.051 --> 00:40:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: But that trip and that
encounter with the indigenous

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.271 align:middle line:90%
people and--

00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the journey.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --the encounter with
the shaman with that plant

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:84%
really was-- it was
all part of it--

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
but that night, I
can say very clearly,

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
was seminal, was
potent, really is

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.150 align:middle line:90%
an experience I'll never forget.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I
appreciate you saying

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that because you solved a lot
of the mysteries in my mind

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:84%
around the plant and
you gave it reverence

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that it really does deserve.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And you had to be the one that,
along with Bill and with John,

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:90%
to continue on the dream.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You had to bring it into
reality and bring it to us

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and create the
symposium and all that

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:84%
had to happen because
of your actions.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean,
this whole concept

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and what you empower us with
is your story and your journey

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:84%
of how you took a vision
and turned it into reality

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and have impacted, not only
us, created a whole movement,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
creating sustainability
on this planet.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
an incredible story

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.644 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I so
appreciate you being here

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm so
honored to sit with you.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Especially as a female, I
just really appreciate that.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's really nice.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It really just is.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And who you represent and
all that is wonderful.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.612 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, the
ayahuasca is a woman.

00:41:30.612 --> 00:41:31.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it's a female plant.

00:41:31.945 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It's a female plant.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a mother plant.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: They refer
to her as a mother.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:90%
They say has she come.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, because you're
waiting for the visions.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.403 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:41:40.403 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --so anyway
there's a lot of--

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.555 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:41:42.555 --> 00:41:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --wisdom that comes
from that feminine energy

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.072 align:middle line:84%
through the rainforest,
through the earth

00:41:47.072 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and through that plant.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.738 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that wisdom
was also inspired

00:41:49.738 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:84%
in the "Awakening
the Dreamer" video.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have another clip on that
that shows the story of stuff

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and how we can really
become aware and conscious

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.940 align:middle line:84%
on the inception of a radio,
a simple little radio.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.044 align:middle line:90%
Let's show that clip.

00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:90%
[START VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.418 align:middle line:10%
>>I was walking to work and I
wanted to listen to the news.

00:42:08.418 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:10%
I found this cute little
green radio for $4.99.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:10%
I was standing there in
line to buy this thing

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.750 align:middle line:10%
and I was thinking, how
could $4.99 possibly capture

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.430 align:middle line:10%
the costs of making this radio
and getting it into my hands?

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The metal was probably
mined in South Africa,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the petroleum was
probably drilled in Iraq,

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:84%
the plastics were probably
produced in China,

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the whole thing
was assembled in Mexico.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:84%
$4.99 wouldn't even pay the
rent for the shelf space

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
it occupied until I came
along, let alone part

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of the staff guy's salary
who helped me pick it out

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
or the multiple ocean
cruises and truck

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.170 align:middle line:84%
rides pieces of
this radio went on.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how I realized I
didn't pay for the radio.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:90%
So who did pay?

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people paid with the
loss of their natural resource

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:51.750 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.180 align:middle line:84%
These people paid with the
loss of their clean air,

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:84%
with increasing asthma
and cancer rates.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.980 align:middle line:84%
All along this system,
people pitched in

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
so I could get this
radio for $4.99.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.950 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that
because it really

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.272 align:middle line:84%
made it in a very simple
term-- the beginning, middle,

00:43:07.272 --> 00:43:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and end-- of where things go.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.313 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you think
more consciously when

00:43:10.313 --> 00:43:13.010 align:middle line:84%
you're in a place,
being a consumer.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I must say, that
is a 20 minute film

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:90%
called "The Story of Stuff"--

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --by an incredible
activist named Annie Leonard.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of her things are
great. "Story of Stuff"

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.630 align:middle line:90%
has won all kinds of awards.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But I recommend people go
look at the whole thing

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because you'll see, really,
the story of our stuff.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't
think about it.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you find out about
it, when you learn about it,

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.020 align:middle line:84%
then you start being
much more discerning.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And it enriches your life.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.879 align:middle line:90%
You give up nothing.

00:43:44.879 --> 00:43:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The main thing I want
to say is that people

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.710 align:middle line:84%
get afraid they're
going to have to give up

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:48.584 align:middle line:90%
the things they love.

00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll end up loving the
things they have way more.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- there's a
great quote from Aristotle.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, I love to
go to the market

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to see all the
things I don't need.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like,
you start to realize, God,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I've got everything
I need and I'm

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.680 align:middle line:84%
going to do a
better job with it.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it makes your life
richer rather than poorer.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
indigenous people

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.900 align:middle line:84%
don't have that attachment
to stuff, and even money.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And it makes their
life much richer, frankly,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
much more meaningful,
less cluttered,

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and their mind clear.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
people to know

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.720 align:middle line:84%
they don't do give
almost anything up.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's what they'll gain is really
what the power of all this is.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it declutters
and uncomplicates things.

00:44:33.747 --> 00:44:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.205 align:middle line:84%
You know how good you
feel when you clear out

00:44:36.205 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
your closet, for example,
or clean out a drawer?

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like doing that
with the way you live.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do
that as a society,

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.034 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
great it's going to be.

00:44:47.034 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It also
helps to declutter

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.229 align:middle line:84%
your mind and your
attachment to things.

00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And all our doubts
about ourselves--

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All that stuff.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.846 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --all that chatter.

00:44:53.846 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.191 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to talk about some

00:44:58.191 --> 00:45:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of the prophecies that the
indigenous cultures have

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:90%
taught you.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And you could share that
with around this culmination

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.070 align:middle line:84%
of this 2012 date and
some of the journeys

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:07.950 align:middle line:90%
that you've been on.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Great.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.513 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:45:09.513 --> 00:45:10.386 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Thank you.

00:45:10.386 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr and I'm
joined by Lynne Twist who

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:84%
is a true global activist and
an inspiration to many of us.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
the indigenous cultures

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
that you visited.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And what is their perspective
around this coming of the 2012,

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.027 align:middle line:84%
the end of time, the
beginning of a new cycle?

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us
some of the prophecies

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.680 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard?

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, one
of the prophecies

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that I'm most
familiar with-- now,

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that the Mayan
prophecy or the Mayan calendar

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
ends in 2012.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very,
very significant thing

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.840 align:middle line:84%
for the Mayan people,
obviously, and also

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.560 align:middle line:84%
indigenous people around the
world are pretty aware of that.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
about the Mayans,

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.160 align:middle line:84%
they've been kind of waiting
for 2012 for 2,000 years

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.110 align:middle line:90%
or thousands of years.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.356 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So it's something
to pay attention to

00:45:57.356 --> 00:45:59.380 align:middle line:90%
even if you don't buy it.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The prophecy I'm
most familiar with

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is the prophecy of the
eagle and the condor.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the indigenous peoples
of the Amazon and the Andes

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
have been telling
it for millennia.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:08.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean, really,
thousands of years

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:10%
about this time in history.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And it comes to fruition
right about now.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And 2012 is an important
milestone in that prophecy.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And that prophecy says that
at this time in history

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.120 align:middle line:10%
the eagle people, who are
the people who perceive life

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.550 align:middle line:10%
primarily through the mind--
that's people like us--

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:32.020 align:middle line:10%
will have reached a zenith in
their capacity to use the mind.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they will have
even invented tools

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.681 align:middle line:84%
to extend the
capacity of the mind.

00:46:37.681 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the computer
and the smartphones and--

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Technology age.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --and all
that stuff we've got.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And they will be
material rich beyond

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:84%
any previous
generation's imagination,

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.360 align:middle line:84%
but they will be spiritually
impoverished to their peril

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and their very survival
will be at risk.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:84%
While the condor people,
and the condor people

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.900 align:middle line:84%
refers to the indigenous
peoples of the planet,

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:84%
people who live primarily
through the wisdom of the heart

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and perceive life
through the five senses.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Those-- and are very conversant
with the spirit world.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The condor people will be
at an incredible zenith

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in their capacity to
intuitive skills and instinct

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and understanding their
kin in the natural world

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and the natural world
cycles and the spirit world.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they will be
materially impoverished

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to their peril in any
encounter with the eagle world

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.532 align:middle line:84%
and their very survival
will be a risk.

00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a
shadow to each side.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.781 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And both sides will
be at their zenith.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And that in this last
500 year period, which is

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.150 align:middle line:84%
called a Pachacuti,
which was called

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.610 align:middle line:84%
the Pachacuti of
dominance and darkness

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:90%
which began right around 1492.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.740 align:middle line:90%
That sounds familiar.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
500 years of dominance and
darkness by the eagle people.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The condor people
and the eagle people

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of
this next 500 year cycle,

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
tenth Pachacutec,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is the Pachacutec of
balance and light.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
eagle and the condor

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.470 align:middle line:84%
will remember that
they are each other

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and reunite, remember,
and fly together

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in the same skies, wing to
wing, and the whole world

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.240 align:middle line:84%
will come back into
balance for 500 years.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the prophecy
for this time.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
the 25 years where

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.750 align:middle line:84%
we move from one Pachacutec,
one 500 year cycle,

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to the next 500
year cycle, there

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.020 align:middle line:84%
will be a humbling of all
the creatures of the Earth

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.170 align:middle line:90%
by Pachamama herself.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:39.220 align:middle line:84%
That is tsunamis, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions,

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.660 align:middle line:84%
tidal waves, unexpected
climate changes.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They've been prophesying this
really for thousands of years.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's Pachamama
humbling her creatures

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.820 align:middle line:84%
so they will find their rightful
relationship with her as we

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.730 align:middle line:84%
go into the Pachacutec
of balance and light

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and the eagle and the condor
fly together in the same sky.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That resonates so much.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I love that prophecy.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So much.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It's so positive.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's not
just that culture.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's many different
cultures that

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
have had similar
types of prophecies.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:90%
The White Buffalo.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: The White
Buffalo prophecy

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.863 align:middle line:84%
is coming to fruition
from the native people

00:49:14.863 --> 00:49:16.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Americas,
the North Americans.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi prophecy,
we are the ones

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.210 align:middle line:84%
we've been waiting for
which is quoted so often

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.820 align:middle line:90%
is coming to fruition 2012.

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The eagle and the condor
prophecy, the Mayan prophecy,

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and I've learned
from Terence McKenna,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the great ethnobotanist who's no
longer living, but in a session

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:84%
we had with him, that
the "I Ching" even

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.860 align:middle line:90%
has a prophecy about 2012.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And that prophecy says
we're ending thousands

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of years of a culture
of habit and we

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.430 align:middle line:84%
move into a culture
of novelty, is the way

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that-- that the "I
Ching" talks about it.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So all of these prophecies
coming to fruition

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:56.010 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
makes 2012, I think,

00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:00.120 align:middle line:84%
a year of beauty, magic, and
transformation for all of us.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't buy any
of that stuff, or if you do,

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.940 align:middle line:84%
thousands and
thousands of years ago,

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:90%
people were talking about 2012.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
to pay attention to.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a very
significant time in history.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
Hollywood end of times

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.070 align:middle line:90%
that we see the movies about.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:19.370 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
has been prophesied

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:90%
by many different cultures.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I look at it is
something where it

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is what you believe
it to be as well.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You can make it as positive
as you want it to be.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You could make it
a time for growth.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I've heard different
astrological forecasts

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of planetary alignments
and so forth.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's whatever
your belief system is.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But it also can relate to
what you put into the future.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:47.177 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that the seeds
planted in 2011 grow in 2012.

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all these different things.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.215 align:middle line:84%
But you catch what
you want to hear--

00:50:50.215 --> 00:50:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Right.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and as long as
it serves you and humanity,

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.247 align:middle line:90%
it's fine with me.

00:50:55.247 --> 00:50:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And many people-- like
Barbara Marx Hubbard

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.080 align:middle line:84%
is orchestrating this
whole birthday 2012.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: The Mayan prophecy
calendar ends on December 21,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and December 22 she's
calling the birthday.

00:51:09.995 --> 00:51:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And I would
say that it's a time--

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and really speaking of people
making a difference with

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.470 align:middle line:84%
their life and getting
on some sort of a path--

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Getting into
action about it.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.778 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Getting into action.

00:51:19.778 --> 00:51:21.790 align:middle line:84%
One way of looking at
our time in history

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.650 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
alive at a time when

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:28.050 align:middle line:84%
we can hospice the death of
the old structures, cultures

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and systems that really
no longer serve us.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:90%
And we can hospice their death.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to kill them.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That are breaking
down all around us.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:35.683 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:51:35.683 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Because they are dying.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.040 align:middle line:84%
If they're
unsustainable that means

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.190 align:middle line:84%
they can't last so
they are falling apart.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we hospice
their natural death,

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.130 align:middle line:84%
they'll die faster
and more gracefully.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.660 align:middle line:84%
While we midwife the birth of
the new structures and systems

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that are appropriate,
that are awakened,

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that are appropriate
to a long term

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.150 align:middle line:90%
future for the human family.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the breaking
down of old systems

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.305 align:middle line:84%
has basically been
prophesied and that's

00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:02.430 align:middle line:84%
kind of what we're
experiencing, what we're seeing.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.971 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:52:02.971 --> 00:52:06.650 align:middle line:84%
You could say that this comes
from the great ecologist

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and businessman and speaker
and just a hero for me,

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Paul Hawken.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:16.111 align:middle line:84%
He says that our species'
immune system is kicking him.

00:52:16.111 --> 00:52:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: And I just love that.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
Occupy Movements

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.550 align:middle line:84%

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.890 align:middle line:84%
On my radio show, people

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:57.540 align:middle line:84%

old jobs breaking down,

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.160 align:middle line:84%
even family systems breaking
down that really were

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.000 align:middle line:84%
in the old paradigm and no
longer able to be sustained now

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.650 align:middle line:84%

the consciousness has shifted,

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:84%
it has reached a point of
critical mass where those

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.330 align:middle line:84%
systems cannot exist any longer
because who we are being has

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:16.195 align:middle line:90%
shifted so much.

00:53:27.966 --> 00:53:29.590 align:middle line:84%
turn down, that's
what you do to a bed.

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:30.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

Downturn or what's often
called the financial crisis

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.860 align:middle line:90%
in that context as well.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I see it-- and I
do a lot of work with money

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.620 align:middle line:84%
as you know as a fundraiser and
a philanthropist and someone

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:84%
who works with
money, and I know we

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about that
too-- as a huge purification.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:53.390 align:middle line:84%
This financial quote unquote
crisis that began in 2007, 2008

>>LISA: How are you
calling it a blessing?

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Because we as
a-- if you look long view,

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:11.040 align:middle line:84%
not short view-- we really
need to wake up about money.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to really have almost
like a shamanic shape shift

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.690 align:middle line:90%
purification about money.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:21.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to come to
terms with the way

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten
caught and lost

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:90%
in our relationship with money.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And money is really
just a symbol

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in many ways of the lost
soul of our species.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But we've really gotten caught
in our relationship with money.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the financial
crisis, you could

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:42.470 align:middle line:84%
call it a cleansing, a
purification, an opportunity

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:46.060 align:middle line:84%
to reboot, to
rethink, to resource,

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.140 align:middle line:84%
reinvent our relationship with
ourselves, the natural world,

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.460 align:middle line:84%
each other and put
money in its place

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than right here in
front of every human being

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and being the only thing
they care about and the thing

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.980 align:middle line:84%
they eclipse everything else
in order to get their hands on.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is the new
relationship with money?

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:08.534 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, in this book,
which is sitting right here.

00:55:08.534 --> 00:55:09.700 align:middle line:90%

Which I wrote.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it-- I wrote
it a long time ago.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it seems like a long
time ago, it came out in 2004--

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.400 align:middle line:90%
the end of 2003, 2004.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's more
relevant now than ever

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:84%
because in that conversation
I really examine

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:35.850 align:middle line:84%
what I call the lie of scarcity
or the condition of scarcity.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Which is really haunts
the human family.

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:42.170 align:middle line:84%
A belief, an unconscious,
unexamined assumption--

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and just to go back
to that-- we have

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.525 align:middle line:84%
unconscious, unexamined
assumptions about money that

00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:50.950 align:middle line:84%
are literally
choking us to death.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, we
forget that we invented it.

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.870 align:middle line:90%
We made money up.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's our creation, it
doesn't grow on trees,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.230 align:middle line:90%
pennies do not rain from heaven.

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We invented money, only
about 3,500, 4,500 years ago.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:05.390 align:middle line:90%

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We now exchange
goods and services

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.810 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have money
rather than use money

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate the equanimity,
the goods and service exchange

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.852 align:middle line:84%

We're called consumers.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.149 align:middle line:84%
And if you look that
up in the dictionary,

00:56:39.149 --> 00:56:41.330 align:middle line:84%
it's the most unattractive
word for a human being.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It means he or she who
takes, depletes, diminishes,

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.552 align:middle line:90%
or destroys.

00:56:45.552 --> 00:56:46.260 align:middle line:90%

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: That's what
the word consumer means.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.638 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're called now.

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.420 align:middle line:90%
We named ourselves that.

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And the word citizen,
on the other hand,

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.360 align:middle line:84%
means he or she who
stands for the well being

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:84%
of the community, the state,
the nation or the world.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm all about
restoring our citizenship

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that it's
not that we don't need

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to buy food and clothing
and take care of ourselves,

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
but there is a kind of
mindset of never enough,

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.770 align:middle line:84%
we've got to have
more, that there's not

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.270 align:middle line:84%
enough to go around, you've got
to get yours before somebody

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
else gets it, that more
is better no matter what,

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:25.120 align:middle line:84%
more shoes, more sweaters,
more market share, more houses,

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.470 align:middle line:84%
more square feet in your
house, more magazines,

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:29.026 align:middle line:90%
more everything.

00:57:29.026 --> 00:57:30.650 align:middle line:84%

the way that it is

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:32.524 align:middle line:84%

world we're living in.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.170 align:middle line:84%
almost like an

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:17.490 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:22.602 align:middle line:84%
We're in a system, a money
system, an economic system--

00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That isn't
working so well.

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --that isn't
working so well.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.803 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: According to some.

00:59:25.803 --> 00:59:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: That's not based
on any real value, that

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.840 align:middle line:84%
generates a constant
demand for more.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even money
comes into existence

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.530 align:middle line:90%
with interest attached.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.127 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
is a private bank,

00:59:38.127 --> 00:59:39.460 align:middle line:90%
it's not part of the government.

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And when money is issued, it's
issued with interest attached,

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:45.750 align:middle line:90%
it needs to be paid back.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's always less money in
circulation than there is owed.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So money itself, in the system
of money, generates debt.

00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That actually is the
money system that we have.

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And the money system
itself creates

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:04.210 align:middle line:84%
an imperative for growth because
the only way you can pay back

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the interest-- which is more
money than is in circulation--

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.450 align:middle line:90%
is by growing the economy.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And that means we have to
commodify more and more

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and more of the natural world.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We need to consume it in order
to create a growing economy.

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is a runaway
unconscious, unexamined

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
assumption that now
is being questioned

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
by some of the very most premier
economists on this planet.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Also, the money system itself
is being questioned in a way

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.200 align:middle line:90%
that it never has been before.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's the blessing, I
say, of the financial crisis.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.659 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how does that
tie into making a difference

01:00:39.659 --> 01:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and to the fundraising
that you talk about?

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you really have a
wonderful different slant

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.160 align:middle line:90%
on fundraising.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
When you have a mission
or a passion or something

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.689 align:middle line:84%
that you want to do
to really help people

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
or to make a difference
in the world,

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.730 align:middle line:84%
but you don't necessarily
have the means to be

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
able to make that difference
because it requires finances.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you can get those
finances because we

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
are in an economic system.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you bridge
all of that together?

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Well, wow.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.895 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful big question.

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:11.835 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: If I'm
not careful, I'll

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
push B7 and start my whole
workshop with you here.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But I actually have
learned almost everything

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I know about money
from raising money.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I've raised hundreds
and hundreds of millions

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.799 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, I've trained
somewhere in the neighborhood

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of 50,000 fundraisers
in something

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.410 align:middle line:90%
like 50, 60 countries.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I've trained people in Ethiopia
to raise money from each other.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the poorest
countries in the world.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Or Bangladesh or
even Mozambique.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.785 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned
that if really you

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
see fundraising in
a different light.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's so hard to give you
enough of a download about this

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
without doing the whole
workshop, but I'll say that--

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
or reading the whole book-- I'll
say that I learned a lot of it

01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
in the Hunger Project.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Hunger
Project is dedicated

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to really eradicating
world hunger.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Eradicating it.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:07.354 align:middle line:84%
And so we obviously needed to
raise a little money to even--

01:02:07.354 --> 01:02:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big--

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --do that kind of work.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --project.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And from
the very outset,

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
we saw that many
organizations were

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
using the pornography of
poverty to make people feel

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
guilty and bad so that they
would dig into their pocket

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and give money.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to
have the hungry people

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.690 align:middle line:90%
to keep your organization going.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So it actually is
a self-defeating--

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --system.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It also is undignified.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
raise up who they are.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I've really, really--
I'm kind of a poster girl

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
for that-- we used to say
in the Hunger Project,

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
there's not a billion
mouths to feed.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a billion
people standing

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
on the front lines of
ending world hunger, some

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
of the most courageous,
innovative, intelligent,

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.280 align:middle line:90%
amazing people in the world.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
privilege-- and they're

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
the people who
experience hunger--

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
privilege to join them.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than see them
as somebody we feel sorry for,

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
if you see the-- if you've
worked them the way I have,

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.336 align:middle line:84%
people live in those
conditions, I mean,

01:03:12.336 --> 01:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't believe what a
woman does when she has seven

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
children, her husband's
abandoned her,

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:18.710 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't have any food.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
How is she going to
get through the day?

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
You think about that.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.510 align:middle line:90%
You've got a daughter.

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For a minute.

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.008 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: You just
think about that.

01:03:25.008 --> 01:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I've sat with women in Ethiopia
after every single child

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.755 align:middle line:84%
that they had died in famine and
they were motherless-- sorry.

01:03:32.755 --> 01:03:33.505 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Childless.

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Childless mothers.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And seeing what
that does to a woman

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
to lose her own child and
not be able to feed her

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
even if she has a baby at her
breast and there's no more milk

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
because she hasn't had
water in two weeks.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
These are courageous people.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
They may not know
how to read, they

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
may be uneducated or illiterate,
but they're not unintelligent.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can even tell
you, those same women

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that I sat with in
Ethiopia and mourned

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
over the deaths
of their children

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.460 align:middle line:84%
when they described each
excruciating death-- now,

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
out of the seven that I sat
with for five days and five

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
nights, four of
them-- who had never

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
even knew how to read or write,
and they were in their late 40s

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
when this famine took place
in Ethiopia back in 1984,

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
1985-- four of them have gone
all the way through school,

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
three of them have
PhD's and one of them

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
is a lawyer and running
the largest female law

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.340 align:middle line:90%
firm in Ethiopia.

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually have picture
of some of these experiences

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.430 align:middle line:90%
that you've been on.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:39.182 align:middle line:84%
And I want to also
close the loop on what

01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
about the finances.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But to give people a
visual of where you've been

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and where your journeys have
taken you and the impact

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that you've made
around the globe

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.250 align:middle line:90%
is really-- it's worth sharing.

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This particular
picture is of a school.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.539 align:middle line:90%
Did you help create this school?

01:04:57.539 --> 01:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, that's actually
not a school we created,

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
but we created a literacy
program in that school

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
specifically for girls.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Because in much of Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa,

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
girls aren't valued and they
don't get to go to school.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And an educated girl changes
the picture dramatically.

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
They have fewer children, they
don't get married so early,

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
they say in Africa,
if you educate

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
a man you educate one person, if
you educate a girl or a woman,

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.312 align:middle line:90%
you educate a nation.

01:05:26.312 --> 01:05:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's really, really true.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So that is a scene
from a school where we opened up

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
the whole possibility
of educating girls

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and ran a literacy clinic
focused on boys and girls.

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that really does
also impact the world hunger

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.609 align:middle line:90%
and the Hunger Project as well.

01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.515 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:42.515 --> 01:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is with you
and President Bill Clinton.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And that's Joan
Holmes who was for many years

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
the president of the Hunger
Project and my great mentor

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and teacher.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's in Washington
when we gave the Africa

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Prize for leadership-- a
prize the Hunger Project gives

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
each year-- to Nelson
Mandela for his great work.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
President Clinton was president
at that time, so he came.

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
He came for our party.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Dignitaries
to now children in--

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: That's in Senegal.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I worked very much
in the Sahel Desert

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
where there's all kinds of
people living where there's not

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
a blade of grass and where you
don't think there's any water.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.604 align:middle line:84%
But we discovered, the
women actually discovered,

01:06:27.604 --> 01:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that if they dug
deep enough there

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
was an underground lake
under all of 17 villages.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.111 align:middle line:84%
75,000 people were
saved from starvation.

01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Because
women's intuition

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
knew that there
was a well there.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's a scene
from the village

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.710 align:middle line:90%
in that region of the Sahel.

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Look at how happy you are.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You just--

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I'm so happy.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You glow.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Look at-- I mean, this is a
picture of a woman on purpose.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.890 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: That's in India at
Mother Teresa's orphanage

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.760 align:middle line:90%
in Calcutta.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa was
another teacher for me.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I even got
a chance to kiss her hand.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But I really learned so
much from Mother Teresa.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
She actually was a great
fundraiser, by the way.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a lot of work I
did in India for the Hunger

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Project, gave me access, and
kind of the great privilege

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of working with her and
really learning from her

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and knowing her before
she passed away.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's in one
of her orphanages.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And there she is.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.086 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: There she is.

01:07:26.086 --> 01:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
She's signing her
business card which

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
has got the Saint Francis
of Assisi prayer on it.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:35.132 align:middle line:90%
And then she signs it M.Teresa.

01:07:35.132 --> 01:07:38.019 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M. Short for mother.

01:07:38.019 --> 01:07:38.602 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

01:07:38.602 --> 01:07:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Short for mother.

01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M period earth.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.110 align:middle line:90%
That's-- wow.

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:50.707 align:middle line:84%
She's-- I want to hear a little
bit more about her fundraising

01:07:50.707 --> 01:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and how she does it.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.248 align:middle line:90%
And where's this?

01:07:52.248 --> 01:07:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: That's in Bangladesh.

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Bangladesh is one of my--
I love all these places,

01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
I love Bangladesh.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Bangladesh has 140 million
people living in a land mass

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.710 align:middle line:90%
the size of Iowa.

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
most sparse rural areas

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.010 align:middle line:90%
in Bangladesh.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.209 align:middle line:84%
But you can see, even
there, they build the houses

01:08:10.209 --> 01:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
right next to each
other because it's

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
a very densely populated
kind of mindset.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But look at how
they've build the houses.

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Those are made out of the
local environment, of course,

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:24.914 align:middle line:84%
and provide shelter and
they're very, very sturdy.

01:08:24.914 --> 01:08:25.830 align:middle line:90%
They look very sturdy.

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.779 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:28.279 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful,
wonderful country.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And Bangladeshi people, their
primary art form is poetry.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And they are
extraordinary poets.

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.779 align:middle line:84%
You don't think of Bangladesh
as a country of poets,

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.326 align:middle line:84%
but I want to say
that so people know.

01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Going to Bangladesh
is an experience

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of interacting with profound--
a profound love for poetry.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
get to experience

01:08:46.695 --> 01:08:47.710 align:middle line:90%
some of the readings?

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Oh, yeah.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.564 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are they about?

01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Very much about their
own love for life and love

01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
for-- they have constant
tsunamis and floods

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and they rebuild their houses
every 10 minutes because they

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.729 align:middle line:84%
get flooded, it's in
a low land, and it's

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the countries that
will absolutely disappear

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
with global warming
if the oceans rise.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a resilience
in the Bangladeshi people

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that they-- that
they sing about.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They also do
fantastic embroidery.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
Grameen Bank was born.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.734 align:middle line:84%
The microcredit
movement really--

01:09:24.734 --> 01:09:25.359 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.442 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: -- you could say
was born in many places,

01:09:27.442 --> 01:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
but Muhammad Yunus, who
won the Nobel Prize, Dr.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad Yunus who started the
Grameen Bank the same year we

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
started the Hunger
Project-- 1977.

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:38.109 align:middle line:84%
And we worked very
closely with him.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bank
that is owned by women

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and lends primarily to
women, $25, $50, $75.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning of
the microcredit movement.

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
amazing movement as well.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.689 align:middle line:84%
And then this is the women
you were speaking of.

01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: That's in Ghana.

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:57.688 align:middle line:90%
That's not in Ethiopia.

01:09:57.688 --> 01:09:58.880 align:middle line:90%
That's in Ghana.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And those women are part of
also Women's World Banking which

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
is another microcredit
movement that--

01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --was founded
by many different people,

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
but one of the founders
is Esther Ocloo in Ghana.

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's at her
center where these

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
are women who are
learning about banking

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and learning about how to
navigate the world of money.

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:22.757 align:middle line:90%
And just a wonderful place.

01:10:22.757 --> 01:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we were
talking about that,

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and I had asked you about
how the fundraising and how

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
you teach people that are in--
even in countries that don't

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
have access to a lot of
money, you teach them

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
how to raise funds
amongst themselves.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.416 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I
just must say that we

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
think of fundraising as
haves giving to have nots.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I try to do everything
I can to sort break up

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
our thinking about that.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Because in the way
I see it, this world

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
of sufficiency and
enough, which is really

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
how I see the world, really
thanks to Buckminster

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Fuller-- and I could
tell you about that, too.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.720 align:middle line:90%
I see that everybody's a have.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
There aren't any have nots.

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So in a place like-- you
could say Ghana or Ethiopia--

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the women that I was
referring to earlier,

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
they have tremendous assets.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the assets
aren't financial.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
We think of assets
as financial, but no.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They know the local language,
they understand dry farming,

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
they know when their
cattle are thirsty by just

01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
color of their fur.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:40.550 align:middle line:84%
They are so incredibly wise
and you cannot actually work

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
on ending hunger in Ethiopia
without the assets that they

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:44.740 align:middle line:90%
bring to the table.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So in the example of
the women in Ethiopia

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
who survived the famine
and their children did not,

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I had that incredible
encounter with them

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and then, just a few days
later, I had to go to New York

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to give a "Soul of Money"
talk to an investment

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
club of extremely wealthy
women in New York City.

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And there were seven of them.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, seven and seven.

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just filled
with being so inspired

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:11.987 align:middle line:84%
about these women
in Ethiopia so I

01:12:11.987 --> 01:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
couldn't talk about
anything but them.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: So I did.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to the
seven wealthy, kind of all

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:22.160 align:middle line:84%
about shopping and lunch and--
kind of women in New York,

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
their husbands were
mega wealthy and they

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
were looking for
meaning, and that's

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.755 align:middle line:84%
why they brought me in to talk
about the "Soul of Money" book.

01:12:28.755 --> 01:12:30.505 align:middle line:84%
I told them about these
women in Ethiopia.

01:12:30.505 --> 01:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we ended
up doing was seeing

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to
partner in a sisterhood

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.180 align:middle line:90%
as co-equal partners.

a fierce commitment to keeping
their tribal ways intact.

I don't think we can really

legitimately call anyone

money have come from,

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
they have come from an
unusual or unexpected source.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
My learnings, my teachings about
money and about many things

01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
have come from people
that I used to call poor.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And I say this pretty much every
time I speak, so some of you've

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
heard this before, but
it's really important

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
for me let you know
that much of what I know

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
has come from people
that I used to call poor,

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that I would never
call poor again.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Because I now know them.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with people that I
used to call poor, side by side

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in Ethiopia after the
famine in 1984, 1985.

Side by side with people in
Bangladesh after a monsoon

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
completely destroyed their
home and they rebuilt it.

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Side by side with
people in India

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
who have taken the
life of their baby girl

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
because they were so
desperately praying for a boy

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and know that girls
actually in that culture,

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
at least at that
time, don't matter.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
people in urban ghettos

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
who really thought violence
was the answer to pretty

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%
much anything and everything.

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a person who's had
a lot of exposure to people

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.209 align:middle line:84%
that I used to
actually label poor

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and I would never
say that about them

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
again, because I know that
when you collapse people's

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
financial circumstances
with who they are,

01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you actually demean
them and those of us

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
who would collapse
that and make them

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
be their financial
circumstances.

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Because people are not their
financial circumstances.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
People are whole
and complete people,

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
living in the ebb and flow
of financial circumstances,

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
the ebb and flow of resources.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.930 align:middle line:90%
So people are not poor.

01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:18.350 align:middle line:90%
No one is.

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has gifts,
everyone has treasures,

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.660 align:middle line:90%
everyone is whole and complete.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen people in
those kinds of circumstances

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
be the most resilient, most
intelligent, most amazing, most

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
innovative, most
outrageously creative people

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.190 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen.

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those kind
of circumstances

01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
sometimes fostered
really true genius.

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And people living in
those circumstances

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
often exhibit more courage
to live through a day

01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
than you and I are going
to need in our lifetime,

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
or ever call upon
in our lifetime.

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So to call them poor
is so inaccurate.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of a
label-- actually when

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.240 align:middle line:84%
you call people something,
you label people something,

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
they actually start buying
it themselves often.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned that people
are whole and complete living

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.860 align:middle line:84%
in resource poor
circumstances and that it's

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:17.860 align:middle line:84%
fair and valid to call
their circumstances poor,

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:18.890 align:middle line:90%
but not them.

they are their trust fund,
they are their bank account,

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
they are their stock options,
they are their private plane

home what they've learned

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and make one small difference
or one large difference

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.630 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And if everyone watching
makes a difference

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and then that person inspires
someone else to do the same

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so on, you've
created that ripple effect

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:28.320 align:middle line:84%
which is, I think, why
you're on this planet.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Oh, thanks.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's so many-- it just
makes life so much more fun,

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.040 align:middle line:90%
actually.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't want to
minimize that because people

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.490 align:middle line:84%
really are looking for
meaning and looking

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
for finding a connection
of their soul.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much
wonderful work to be done.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.064 align:middle line:84%
And if you go on a website
like Green America,

01:19:50.064 --> 01:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
they tell you all
about things you

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.912 align:middle line:90%
can do with social justice and--

01:19:52.912 --> 01:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's available.

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
The information is out there.

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: The pathways
are right there.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And I think
the thing to do

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
is just put your hand on your
heart and see what's my role.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone
has a role to play.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not a big role
or a small role.

01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What calls to you.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It's just your role--

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:07.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: --and it's unique.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.452 align:middle line:84%
And if you play it,
your life will flourish

01:20:11.452 --> 01:20:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and you'll make a difference.

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're making
a big difference

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.450 align:middle line:84%
with the Four Years Go
project which is a lot of fun.

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And you've brought technology
and a whole media campaign

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
into-- what exactly
is that Four Years Go?

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, Four Years
Go is a giant conversation.

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:29.010 align:middle line:10%
It's a media kind
of campaign and it's

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.500 align:middle line:10%
a kind of commitment
campaign, and in many ways

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.830 align:middle line:10%
it's naming this
time in history.

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:36.730 align:middle line:10%
So I like to say, people
who lived during the roaring

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:40.020 align:middle line:10%
'20s looked like they were
having a really good time.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.810 align:middle line:10%
But they didn't really know,
oh, we're in the Roaring '20s.

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.930 align:middle line:10%
They didn't call it the
roaring '20s until afterwards.

01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:48.730 align:middle line:10%
We are now so evolved
as a human species

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:52.170 align:middle line:10%
and so awake really
now, that we are

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:54.150 align:middle line:10%
aware that we are
living in a time

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:58.587 align:middle line:10%
when it's really the time of
a big, gigantic seismic shift.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:20:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Shift.

01:20:59.170 --> 01:20:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And we're-- the Four
Years Go campaign really names

01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:07.275 align:middle line:90%
2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014--

01:21:07.275 --> 01:21:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
the four years.

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --as the pivotal four
years when we're shifting from

01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
a trajectory-- moving the human
family towards a trajectory

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of dangerous, inhospitable,
unsustainable, dark,

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
violent future-- which you
can feel is kind of where

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we're heading-- to shifting
towards a hospitable,

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.879 align:middle line:90%
sustainable, peaceful--

01:21:27.879 --> 01:21:28.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Compassionate.

01:21:28.795 --> 01:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: --nonviolent,
nourishing future.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And the shift is taking
place in these four years

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't make it happen
in these four years, of course.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.049 align:middle line:84%
But I say the tide
has already turned.

01:21:39.049 --> 01:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I mean, this
program is part of it.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:43.602 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And Gaiam is part
of it and you're part of it

01:21:43.602 --> 01:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and the people watching
this and the people who

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.655 align:middle line:84%
aren't watching
this are part of it.

01:21:46.655 --> 01:21:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.087 align:middle line:90%
True.

01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:47.586 align:middle line:90%
True.

01:21:47.586 --> 01:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And we want them to
have the opportunity to own it,

01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to author it, to be part of
it so that we can accelerate

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.154 align:middle line:84%
that shift and make
sure it happens in time.

01:21:57.154 --> 01:21:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there'll be a time

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
when some things
will be irreversible,

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
particularly with
the environment.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So this shift that
is taking place,

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
to have it really
shift four years then

01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.450 align:middle line:84%
go in this new
direction-- and not

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that everything will resolved
by the end 2014-- but let's

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:17.572 align:middle line:84%
allow this shift to
happen in who we are.

01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's
a part-- this is

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the clip that we're going to
show you of how people can

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:24.549 align:middle line:84%

01:22:24.549 --> 01:22:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a really fun,
motivating clip.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.246 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the Four Years Go clip.

01:22:29.246 --> 01:22:29.829 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

01:22:29.829 --> 01:22:31.825 align:middle line:90%

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
It just gets you moving.

01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:41.419 align:middle line:84%
It makes you want to--
where did that come from?

01:25:41.419 --> 01:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
What was the
inspiration behind that?

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.596 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Oh, well, we had
the most miraculous set

01:25:47.596 --> 01:25:50.095 align:middle line:84%
of circumstances that brought
us in communication with Widen

01:25:50.095 --> 01:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and Kennedy, the
largest independent ad

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
agency in the world, independent
ad agency network in the world.

Owned by Dan Widen
whose this amazing

01:25:58.990 --> 01:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
guy who went to the rainforest
with us and partnered with us.

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
can I do to help

01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you change the dream
of the modern world?

01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of a
cool thing to ask.

01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And move us towards--

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because he
can if anyone-- yes?

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.700 align:middle line:90%
the mission of the symposium.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
How can we help
you move humanity

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:24.000 align:middle line:90%
in that direction faster?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well, let's
partner and create something.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And we created this video
together and the whole idea

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
of really naming these four
years as the years when

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
we can really turn the tide.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And so without them, I don't
know what we would have done.

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But they're so good and they
made that video with us.

01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
We did it together.

01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And so out of that has
come a film contest

01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
about the possible futures
and all kinds of people

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
are using Four Years Go
as a template for planning

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and there's more than
1,000 organizations that

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
have signed on all kinds
of people and companies

01:26:58.570 --> 01:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
have changed their trajectory.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.626 align:middle line:90%
It's just awesome.

01:27:01.626 --> 01:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
world is different.

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not that Four
Years Go is causing it.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.665 align:middle line:84%
It's naming it and giving
people permission--

01:27:07.665 --> 01:27:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
