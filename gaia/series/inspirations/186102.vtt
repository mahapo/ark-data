>>LISA GARR: Would you like to
live a life with no regrets?

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Many articles are written
about the regrets of the dying.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:10%
And they say that they
regretted working too much

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:10%
and spending too little
time with family.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that we
all will die at some point.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It's an illusion to think
that we will live forever

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
in this body.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we really want to
live a conscious life,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
we also need to be conscious
about the dying process

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and identify the death
phobia in our culture.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And someone who has
dedicated her life

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to the conscious dying process
is shamanic practitioner Kitty

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Edwards.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
She's the executive director
of the No Regrets Project.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a program for the
Living and Dying Consciously

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Project, where
Kitty helps people

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
become aware of the living
and the dying process.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.002 align:middle line:90%
What you do is phenomenal.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KITTY EDWARDS: It is.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where does this death
phobia come from, Kitty?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, well
I think everyone's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:10%
afraid of death in
any time period.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:10%
It's not the phobia
that's unusual,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:10%
it's how secret we keep
death from the culture.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:10%
We put people who are
terminally ill in hospitals,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and they're separated from
their families, oftentimes.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
They're isolated in
a room, by themselves

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%
or with another person.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
have the traditions

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of rituals that might
go on in a community

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to support their dying.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.665 align:middle line:84%
So I think the fear is
greater in our culture.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It hasn't always
been like this, of course.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.537 align:middle line:84%
The traditions are amazing
around death and ceremony.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And realize death
happened really close by.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It always happened at
home or in the streets,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
or you could see it, you could
touch it, you could smell it.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a part of
your everyday life.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So as a child, you would
have witnessed many deaths

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
by the time you were
in your 20s or 30s

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because just the
community around you.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Doors were open
when people died.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You went to visit
when people died.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You held each other's
hearts when people died.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:90%
And now, we tend to isolate.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's hard.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, it's
the same process when

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
you lose a loved one and
you have pain and you feel.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about in
the traditional times.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would honor that
process with time and ceremony

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and tradition.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures, and
the Jewish culture

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
still does this with
the sitting shiva,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of great
ways to honor and mourn.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we have lost
it so much in this culture.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Many people have lost their
traditional religious beliefs

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
or their community within
a religious belief.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they're
not practicing rituals.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.117 align:middle line:90%
They're not familiar with them.

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they come in
contact with them, say

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish tradition,
they don't resonate with them

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They're very rich traditions,
but in our modern lives,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:90%
we live such busy lives.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Our traditional rituals
are not alive for us now.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk about
that because it is easier,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
almost, to not grieve.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
It is almost easier
to not sit and stare,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and to involve
yourself with things

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and the business of death,
and the certificates

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and the notifications
and all that.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It can get really distracting.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It's.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Hard

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.725 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It's hard.

00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Death is hard for the families
and for the person who's dying.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a challenge.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge to live
consciously all the way

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to the threshold of death,
and stay in heart connection

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
with your loved ones
and your community

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.535 align:middle line:84%
and those things that
make you so human.

00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're dealing
with death certificates, all

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
the bureaucracy of it,
our whole medical system

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
does not deal with death
and approaching death.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Many doctors I work with
perceive death as the enemy.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if death
is the enemy, you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:90%
can never let it in the door.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
You can never admit
that it's happening.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're admitting
as a doctor you have failed,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're in the
life business, the saving

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
business, yes.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Not in the death business.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: And that's great.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: We all want that.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But when
someone is dying,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
we need to have a different
approach to things.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think hospice has created
a different way of holding

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
people that way, because
grief doesn't start

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
happening at the
time of death, it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
starts at the
terminal diagnosis.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And our grief, sometimes we
don't want to step into that.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have to work,
and we can't step into that.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:90%
So we push things aside.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's easier to pretend
it's not happening.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it
used to happen quite a bit

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s, where they
wouldn't even tell patients

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
they were dying, but
the family would know.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was
really, really hard.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
whole hospice movement

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and bringing the death
terminology to hospitals

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
has helped somewhat, but
we've got a ways to go.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:90%
What is hospice?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, hospice
is an organization,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:90%
either for-profit or non-profit.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an organization
that works in teams.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So there will be a doctor.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
If you enter a
hospice organization,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.085 align:middle line:84%
you would have a
terminal illness,

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and a doctor would have
said, you're probably

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:90%
going to die within six months.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And they would set
up a team for you.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And there would be a
doctor on your team,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
a nurse on your team, a
chaplain on your team,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
a social worker to help you
get the equipment you need,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and then a CNA,
most importantly.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
A CNA, a certified
nursing assistant

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
who can come and help you
eat and bathe and dress

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and all those things that
maybe are a little more

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
difficult for you to do.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So the team approach is
really the miracle of hospice.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When did
that get created?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, it started
in England in the early '70s.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Late '60s, '70s.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
In this country, it came
over around '75, '76.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is--
it's phenomenal.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it comes from
traditions of what is needed.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.195 align:middle line:90%
Nursing traditions.

00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nursing traditions.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Because the nurse is there.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
They see what needs to happen.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And in our previous
conversations,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
we talked about Kubler-Ross,
who worked with the dying

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and listened to the
dying about their needs

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and their experiences.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to articulate
what the needs of the dying

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
are and, in her vernacular,
the stages of dying,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
which we've talked about, too.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is also
the stages of grief.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.937 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Absolutely.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It works for both
the dying and the grieving.

00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Mhm.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Denial.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about denial.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.683 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Denial, yes.

00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And that
fear that comes up,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and depression, where you
just can't function at all.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
do happen in grief,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and they happen as
you approach death.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As you approach death.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:90%
So the five stages--

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
denial, acceptance,
bargaining, making that why--

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:90%
take me instead of my--

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I saw my mom do that, take me.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
The depression, which is
the hundred-yard stare,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and trying to-- and stopping
when you're trying to do

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
regular things,
and you just can't.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Stops you in your tracks.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
These stages aren't
a linear pattern.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
They go up.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:90%
They go down.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.575 align:middle line:90%
They come, they circle around.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And so grief will be
your next challenge, of course,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
with yourself--

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: --and your family.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.532 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I've seen it.

00:08:15.532 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, anger, which is the
fifth one I didn't mention,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I saw that one first.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I saw that come out first.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:90%
How normal is it to be angry?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Well, oftentimes
when people are angry,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:10%
it's because they're not
getting their needs met.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of psychologists
that work with emotions

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
try to take apart emotions.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you're angry, it's
good to look at your anger

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and see where it's coming from.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you're dying and
you can't express it

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and you have no one else to
talk about it because nobody

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
wants to talk about it, then
anger could be expressed.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My dad went
through a period

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
where he was angry at my
mom for being able to walk

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:90%
because he couldn't anymore.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.493 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And his legs were
completely failing at the end.

00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And he just would
watch my mom walk in,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:90%
and he would just get angry.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to explain to
her not to take it personally.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But because
they had been

00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:21.918 align:middle line:84%
an interpersonal relationship
for 57, 58 years.

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Well, it could be
possible he doesn't really

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:10%
want her waiting on
him, and he wants

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:10%
to be able to get
up and take care

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:10%
of Himself he's self-reliant.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
That's who he is.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
He's powerful,
he's self-reliant.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And you get angry when
you have a loss like that.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So those stages of
death come in for terminal

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:90%
illness and the grieving, yes.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
You go through all
of these undulations.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It kind of helps to know--

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.702 align:middle line:84%
but does it help to know
that these stages exist,

00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and that we're going to
go through all of this?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, it helps to
be aware, but what really helps

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:90%
is to prepare for death.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are many deaths
that we experience.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
A divorce is a death.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Job loss.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: A loss of a job.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Grief associated with
that, anger, depression.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.782 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bargaining.

00:10:11.782 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Bargaining,
yeah, all the--

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
so these are something that
we live with all the time.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And so to be aware of what your
emotions are and what they mean

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:10%
is very important, but it's
also important to be aware

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to go
through deaths over and over.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And the more we practice
with death, and saying,

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is a death, OK.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is why
I think that it's

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
so important to have
this conversation,

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because you bring ceremony
back into this process.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And ceremony allows
energy to move.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It moves
the energy of death.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It moves the energy of grief.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Not that we need to
get over it, but it

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:84%
helps it not get so sedentary
and so painful and stuck.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah, I
think what ritual does,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:10%
too, it moves energy, but it
also takes us out of our heads,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:10%
out of our heads, and brings
us down into our hearts.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we can be
in our heart, we

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
can make a heart connection
with our families,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:90%
our friends, our departed.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's tough
when they're gone.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: I know.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's hard.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you do as
a shamanic practitioner?

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, with
a private client,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I work a lot with
people who cannot speak,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
either from a stroke or some
disability caused by a terminal

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:90%
illness.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And our health care
system doesn't really

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
function very well with
people that don't speak.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But I do energy work,
so we can communicate

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
using energy work, which
would be even like,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, if I do this,
it's exchanging energy.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:10%
Or if I just send you heart,
that's exchanging energy.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've been trained
to sort of amp

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that energy up in order to be
able to communicate and shift

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
for people their fears, their
anger, their depression--

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: --and their hope.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.447 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have these
beautiful rituals around these

00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk
about in a second,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to ask
you, where did you start

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:90%
to learn about all of this?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:84%
What around curiosity
piqued your curiosity

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
about helping the
death and dying?

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Well, I've
been working in death

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:10%
since I was six years old.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.498 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really realize
I was working with death.

00:12:35.498 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like
people were dying

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%
and I was sitting with them.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:10%
It was not until my
early 30s that my brother

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:10%
said something to me
like, why is it you know

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:10%
all these people who are dying?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:10%
And I asked him, I
said, what do you mean?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:10%
Don't you know
people who are dying?

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:10%
He said, I don't
know anyone dying.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well, either
he's nuts or I'm nuts.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So I guess I'm the unusual one.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
I've done all my life.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So people know I'm comfortable
with death, so they call on me.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But how I got into shamanism
is a different story.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
a writing project,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
doing research in Borneo.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading about
the shamans, the medicine men

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and women of Borneo,
and I got to work

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of medicine
men doing trance work.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was so fascinating.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought when I
came home, maybe

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I can find out somebody
who's doing something here

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:90%
in the States.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to go into
shamanic training programs,

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and then was able to go
down to South America

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and work with the Q'iru in Peru,
and also with some medicine men

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and women in Bolivia.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.492 align:middle line:84%
So I've sort of jumped
all over the place.

00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've brought
back some traditions

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:90%
that really could help.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Was that a yearning for you when
you were learning about what

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
exists elsewhere and
how it could really

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:90%
help people in the US?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I think in the beginning, I
was just trying to help myself.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It was so rich.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:90%
It cracked me open.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
It helped me be present and
realize what kind of power

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I might have or not have
in different circumstances.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So it sort of
made me fearless, in a way,

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
so that I could see
that we're so much

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:90%
more than we think we are.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn techniques
that are just like magic,

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:90%
it's like, wow.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and then you can bring it
to the people you work with.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was a beautiful
way of explaining it.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You just migrated
towards people who

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
were dying when you were young.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Did you lose your
parents at a young age?

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: No, I didn't, but
I had a near-death experience

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
at six months, and
again at age 16.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That you remembered?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: I didn't remember
until I did some work later on,

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:84%
but I had heart
surgery at age 16.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
experience, as you mentioned.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved to have
a comedy routine going on

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of heart surgery.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So I had that
experience of being out of body

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that I did remember,
but that was so weird

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that I never shared it with
anyone until much later,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
when I realized, OK, that's
what makes me comfortable.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Going back and forth
and here and there, so.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're very familiar
with going between worlds.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's very
common for you.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It is now.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a language
for it, and I have

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
tools to actually do it in a
safe and not a traumatic way.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
shot out of my body.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's important.

00:15:47.585 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't recommend it.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's not fun.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah,
so it's much more--

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.112 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The precursor to
near-death experience is

00:15:53.112 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:90%
usually trauma, and--

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: That's
not a good thing.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's not.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But if we can learn to do
this in a different way

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and really learn to
go between worlds,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I think that is fascinating.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, it's great fun.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you know, especially
comforting for the grieving,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
because I still--

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
my father was a
scientist, and he

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was grappling with,
at the end of his life, if I

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
just shut my eyes,
do the lights go out?

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I felt him really
grappling with that.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I was getting these dreams
where he was just saying--

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and I remember this
specific dream,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
as if he came to me in my dream,
and he said, how do I do this?

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:90%
How do I do it?

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Do I just close my eyes
and the lights go out?

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, he needed
evidence of things.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
God bless him.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We need our scientists
in the world.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to explain
or show him there's light

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's peace
and there's expansion

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's interconnectedness
like you've never

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:90%
seen in this world before.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to show him
these things in the dream

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, when he finally
did make his transition,

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I was able to--

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I was actually in a meditation.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in front of
him, I was away from him.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a meditation.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this giant
explosion, this burst of light.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I was facilitated by a
friend of mine, Dane, here.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And he was so amazing.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my dear, this
is a bit of my specialty,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%
are you ready?

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what he
was really talking about.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We went into this
kind of trance,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.733 align:middle line:84%
and my father's
spirit was with us,

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was on the
phone with Dane.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And just this burst of light.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And I floated out of my body.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But that was my dream, was to
usher my dad's soul into what

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I know as the afterlife.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.805 align:middle line:90%
And I got to experience that.

00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS:
Oftentimes, the people

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
who are transitioning
do anticipate.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If they can't let go of
someone, like your mother,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
they wait until your
mother's out of the room.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that magical?

00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:10.025 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:11.965 align:middle line:84%
And your brother needed
the physical reality.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He's probably someone
like your father.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
He needed that reality--

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He did.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --of being
present with the body when

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:90%
the body stopped living.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When he stopped--
when he took his last breath.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And your
father showed you

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that you were able to escort
him across the threshold.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: What a gift.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.055 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Your
father's wonderful.

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: He did
it just perfectly.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And even
though it didn't

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
feel-- if anyone's
going through this,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking at their
beloved passing and crossing,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't appear
they're there, it does not,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:84%
for all the logical mind,
appear that they're there,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
if they've had a
stroke or anything,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I read Jill Bolte Taylor's
book, which was so amazing.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
She was the
neurosurgeon in a coma.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And she said,
"they can hear you."

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Absolutely.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Olfactory, the
hearing is the last to go,

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:90%
the last sense to go.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:90%
They can hear you.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The stroke victims
can hear patients.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Can hear.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
They can hear.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
you're saying, it

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
lands on a soul,
the essence of it.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is it a huge
thing that I learned.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, so
realistically, too.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So dying consciously
is living consciously

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to the end.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about the senses.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you hear,
the last thing you smell,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you touch
are all so important.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Living consciously is
an essential endeavor.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we can live
consciously, knowing

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that death is inevitable, we can
wake ourselves up to living--

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More fully.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:90%

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Dying.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Just being aware of
the dying, and working

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
with our hopes and our fears
and our heart connections

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
with our loved ones.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Dying consciously is

>>LISA: It's an illusion.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: --we can't escape it.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: So what
we teach is that you

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:10%
can prepare for death
as a rite of passage,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:10%
as a time of transition.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And we teach four or
five different ways

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for death.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's really up
to the individual

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:90%
what they may choose to do.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is to get
your literal documents.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Your living will, appoint
your medical agent.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Get your last will
and testament,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
get things in order so that
you are consciously preparing.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Before
you even get sick.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, yes.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Before anything happens.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Just now.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Just now.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody should do it.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not that everybody
needs to get sick, by the way.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to program it.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: No, no, no.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But they
need to prepare.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Prepare.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: And then another
level of preparation

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:10%
is your emotional, to really
work with your emotions

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:10%
and start to understand
what does anger mean to me.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:10%
What is that when I get angry?

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Am I frustrated with myself?

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there a need
that's not being met?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's different
for different people.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
When I'm sad, where does
the sadness come from?

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:10%
And how do I get
out of the sadness,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:10%
or how do I work
with the sadness?

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:10%
Some days, I just
have to be sad.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:10%
So if you know more
about your emotions,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and you know how to let go
and shift those emotions

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and have a practice like
meditation or heart map.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Visualization,
heart map.

00:21:53.635 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --yeah
visualization--

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can work
with your emotions

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able
to come to some peace.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do it
on your deathbed.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't start it
on your deathbed.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
You need to start much
earlier so that you're

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:90%
aware of who you are.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
mythic preparations.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is the fun part.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:90%
The storytelling.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:90%
We did a lot of that.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: The legacy we're--
what legacies you're leaving.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And I'm not talking
about necessarily big legacies.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It can be little teeny legacies
of love and peace and family.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The thing is
about it the instant, when

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:90%
somebody dies quickly.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Oh, yes,
that's very traumatic.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The shock
takes a long time.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right, yeah.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
A traumatic death and
certain sudden death

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
complicates the grief because
you don't get to say goodbye.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have an opportunity
to say I love you.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
At least, you feel you
don't have an opportunity

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:90%
to say that.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of guilt involved.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
What could I have done
to make this different?

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: You know,
did we have to go

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to the grocery store that
day, did we have to do this.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.745 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't I see this coming?

00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of guilt that we

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
have to work with in
the middle of our grief.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So sudden death, suicide, very
complicated in our culture.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
more and more lately.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
from the other side,

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
even though someone
has a terminal illness,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.803 align:middle line:90%
it still feels sudden.

00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know anyone who's
gone through that experience

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.887 align:middle line:84%
with a loved one knows
what I'm talking about.

00:23:35.887 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:90%
It still feels sudden.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you
could see it coming,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:90%
but you're never ready for it.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: No, you're
never ready for it.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But you did have
the opportunity to--

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: God bless, yeah.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --laugh
and tell stories and--

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Listen to music.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --listen
to music and hug and--

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, touch and caress.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And we did it all.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:90%
We even fought.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Oh,
that's the best part.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was funny because
we wound up laughing about it.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
tensions rise, and there's

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:90%
so many decisions to make.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Should we give him
this drug, should we not,

00:24:07.747 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:90%
dah, dah, dah.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
decisions to make.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go back to
the traumatic part of this

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and where a person goes
into shock, because there's

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
a piece to the passages,
the rites of passage that

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
is the ceremony piece, the
death rites, the vigil.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:84%
What types of ceremony
do you suggest--

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the
transition, how

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
can people process it,
hold that sacred space?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, certainly
at the time someone dies,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
if you're with them,
like your brother was,

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
it might take a
little foreplanning,

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:84%
but to have a little
ritual, even if you just

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.308 align:middle line:84%
put your hand on their heart,
if your brother could do that.

00:24:52.308 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
He probably was holding
your father's hand.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, he was.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And he can, you know,
sing a song, say a prayer,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.242 align:middle line:90%
say thank you.

00:25:02.242 --> 00:25:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But it would take
some forethought,

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:84%
because immediately,
that is a shock.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
We're not ready for
it to actually happen.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.698 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have
a little forethought.

00:25:10.698 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and his
numbers were actually

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
increasing and rising, his
breaths per minute were rising.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: He was doing
better, you perceived.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I heard that's common.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:90%
There's an energy.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when someone's
dying, there's an energy.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the will to
live is very strong,

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and so there's often
a sort of a healing.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
sit up and speak.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:90%
A surge.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: There's a
surge of energy, yeah.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what does--

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:90%
does it just go away?

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well,
the body is dying.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, OK.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And the
body is fighting it.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And so it's really--

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:90%
it's a fight.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, I want to stay,
I want to stay, I want to stay,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and you're really fighting hard.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Like your immune system has
to really get strong and fight

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
disease right before the end.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Some
people are in a coma

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have that surge
of energy that's perceptible.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that is
very common, isn't it?

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so
the perception is

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
they're getting better, which is
why we walked out of the room.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But your
father, it seems

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:90%
like he needed you to leave.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
clear about that.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: He's tricky that way.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:84%
He was taking care
of us all to the end.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: He was.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And he still is.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He still is.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes, he is.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you
about a funeral

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
we just did last weekend,
which was a wonderful ceremony.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:90%
A lot of grieving.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It was a suicide.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:90%
It was sudden.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Large family, lot of grief.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But the family needed to come
together, which they did,

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in ceremony in order to
release their loved one.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Release him to let go,
which is really hard to do.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call it
giving permission to die,

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:90%
even after someone's died.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Because if we
can't give them permission,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
then our grief is going to
hold tight to our heart.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And let the
soul travel, right?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Let the soul be free.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You told me
the story of a lake.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: That's
an Ojibwe legend,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:10%
or it's actually a tradition.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:10%
They live on lakes,
and their tradition

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:10%
is that they build a canoe
with love for the departed one.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:10%
And they set the
canoe out on the lake.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.930 align:middle line:10%
And with their grief, the energy
of their grief, their wailing,

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:10%
their weeping, their
begging, please don't leave,

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:10%
they ship that canoe,
causing ripples in the lake.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And the canoe begins to move.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And on this lake,
there is the village

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the living who
are grieving, and on

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the far distant side of the
lake is the village of the dead.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
through the mist--

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
you can't see that far, but
you hear them celebrating

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and calling the departed.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Come on over, we
can't wait to see you.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The ancestors are there
to hold the departed.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.400 align:middle line:10%
And so with our grief in
the village of the living,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:10%
we continue to push the
canoe across the lake.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love this.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It gives grief a purpose.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It gives grief motion.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
disappear it, but it gives

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:90%
the energy of grief movement.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is very,
I think, worthwhile.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Well.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I see my
mom sitting with the grief,

00:28:48.687 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's solidifying,
and it's immobilizing.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
her, Mom, you need

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to get up and move because
she can't hear it right now.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so that's
the type of movement

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that that ceremony does.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's metaphorical,
of course, right?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's metaphorical,
but it's also

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:90%
about ways of grieving.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Dancing, you were talking
about moving, wailing.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And so many cultures wail.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's so great to
get it out of your system,

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and express it and
move it and shake it.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:10%
And to sit still with
it is almost unbearable.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.852 align:middle line:90%
It's very challenging.

00:29:37.852 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
There was another one that you
mentioned called the Rainbow

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Bridge?

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: OK, that's a
despacho ceremony, where

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
this is a ceremony from Peru.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's called aya despacho.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Aya means death.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Despacho means to dispatch.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And you build, with tissue paper
and all kinds of ingredients--

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.170 align:middle line:84%
herbs and flowers
and rose petals--

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:84%
you build a Rainbow Bridge
with different layers.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
A black layer, a red
layer, a green layer,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
blue layer, which is like
the mountains, and then

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:90%
a purple layer and a gold layer.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:10%
And with your prayers, you
keep putting your prayers

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.510 align:middle line:10%
into this prayer bundle,
and once it's all complete,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:10%
you fold it up and either
burn it in a ceremonial fire,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:10%
releasing your prayers so that
they can go to the other side

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:10%
and be delivered,
or, in these days,

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:10%
we have a lot of cremations, you
can put a despacho if there's

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:10%
no metals or unusual materials
in it, if it's all natural,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:10%
you can send it to the
crematorium with the deceased.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So the prayers actually go into
the fire with the deceased.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, in a sense,
it brings the dreams

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
into the next lifetime,
or into the eternal.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Whatever
you want to believe.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it does.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And that process of my prayer
for him, my dream for him,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
my love for him, my
gratitude for him

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.910 align:middle line:90%
all is the process of grieving.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again, it
moves the energy.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, and
creating your own ritual.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:90%
We all create ritual.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: This is not
something you can't do yourself,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
but creating your own
ritual to set your intention

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:90%
to remember him and thank him.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, can I ask
you about this process

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.538 align:middle line:90%
with the urn?

00:31:38.538 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: The
process with the urn--

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.038 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know this is
making this so personal,

00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
but I have to just-- it's so
fresh that, when my mom went

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to go pick up the urn from
the mortuary with his ashes,

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.687 align:middle line:90%
what do you do with it?

00:31:52.687 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the front
seat with the seat belt?

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do you put it--

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do you do?

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.213 align:middle line:84%
And we got stuck, like
what do we do with this?

00:32:01.213 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: You know, that's
the first time I've been asked

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:10%
that, but that's wonderful--

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It was mind-bending.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --because I have
been in that same situation.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's got to be--

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: I picked up--

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --a better way.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.168 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --my grandmother,
and my grandmother

00:32:12.168 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:90%
was a very proper Southern lady.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
She always had to be properly
made up and properly dressed

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and looking beautiful.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:10%
And when I went to
pick her up, they

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:10%
handed me her in a little box
wrapped in sort of dirty paper.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And I'm thinking,
oh my, oh my, I'm so sorry.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
make sense, right?

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That this-- I mean,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to explain
to my mom particles,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and nothing was working.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: No.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.358 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: There's no good way.

00:32:42.358 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I did put her in
the back seat, and I

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
did put a seat belt around
her, if you want to know.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:90%
We all do that.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I drove her home,
and I met my brother,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.640 align:middle line:84%
who had just arrived,
in the hotel lobby.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And he says, what do you got?

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.705 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, that's--

00:32:57.705 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Grandma
in the back seat.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.455 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: No,
she's in my hands.

00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
He's like, what are
you doing with her?

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.290 align:middle line:10%
I said, I'm going to put her
in the closet in the room

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:10%
until we need her again.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But I need to change

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's preparation.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --she had the
foresight to do a double box.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's half for
her and half for him.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And then when she passes,
the ashes are combined,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and then they're together.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Wonderful.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.787 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And instead
of putting him

00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.570 align:middle line:84%
in the closet,
which we discussed,

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:90%
we put him in the living room.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah, why not?

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.707 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With the pictures of
the family on the shelves.

00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Mhm, mhm.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right where they used
to sit and watch TV in their two

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:90%
chairs, and just right there.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And it was awesome
because the dog

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:10%
got up and sat in his chair.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:10%
He's sitting right
next to both of them.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's perfect.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you know, this is
the type of thing we actually

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:84%
wound up laughing
over, which was great

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
because it was so absurd.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But great,
and perfect for him,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
who had such a great
sense of humor.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He did.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.200 align:middle line:90%

>>EDWARDS: That was perfect.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wonderful.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's
got to be, as you say,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:84%
anticipation of these moments
to have some type of ceremony

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.489 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's something
you make up on the fly--

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and you
figure out, it's

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:84%
just that honoring, because
the death process does

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:90%
tend to be mechanized.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a business.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
Like anything else,
it's a business.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
And the size of the
coffin and the colors

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.900 align:middle line:84%
inside the coffin and the type
of wood the coffin's made--

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.733 align:middle line:84%
It gets to be very
business-like.

00:34:36.733 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It is a business.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's costly.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It's a big business.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It is costly.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a big movement for
green funerals and more

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:90%
natural funerals these days.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just right
here in Colorado,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:90%
they've opened a new--

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
Natural Funeral Home.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk in their door,
they do have pots for urns,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're all made by
Colorado local artists.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And there's a
panel on the wall of three

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of woods.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a local carpenter
that will make you a coffin.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:90%
You choose the wood.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have artists that will
paint the coffin, if you wish.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So I think
things are changing.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: I have
hope that we're

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be creating different
traditions for dying.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and anyone who
went through that process,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:84%
please know that I'm
not making it wrong.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:33.568 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking at the entire
would-- a dear friend of ours

00:35:33.568 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
who went through
this process with us

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and lost his dad
a month prior, he

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
took pleasure in picking out
what his dad would have wanted.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.320 align:middle line:90%
The velvet inside the coffin.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.037 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Absolutely.

00:35:45.037 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --it brought
him pleasure.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Absolutely.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.575 align:middle line:84%
And different traditions
require different things.

00:35:50.575 --> 00:35:51.766 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:35:51.766 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So it's
really making your ritual

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%
true to your values.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And whatever works for you.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.430 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: No.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But can we
go back to that idea

00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:05.740 align:middle line:84%
of living without any
regrets, no regrets.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.880 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole foundation
called the No Regrets

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.097 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Right,
that was started

00:36:10.097 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:10%
by Patti Panza, who created
the project in the last six

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:10%
months of her life.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:90%
This is her legacy.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And she developed five
practices she thought

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
would help her get to her
deathbed with no regrets.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And so she shared
it with everyone else.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And those practices are
be grateful every day,

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:10%
choose joy, trust,
and take the risk,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:10%
have the courage to be
yourself, and love yourself

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:10%
first, and then share it.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard one.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the hardest one.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Meaning that if
you give everything away,

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you will have
nothing left to give.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So love yourself first.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- caregivers have
a very hard time with that

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.960 align:middle line:90%
because they have so much to do.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Constantly.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So for caregivers,
it's that, you

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.653 align:middle line:84%
know, OK, step back, take care
of yourself, and then share it.

00:37:12.653 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was the
hardest thing for my mom,

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because she was
constantly tugged.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:84%
If she wasn't at the
hospital, she felt guilty.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
When she was at the
hospital, she felt guilty.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Trying to make the phone
calls of all the preparations

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.773 align:middle line:90%
for hospice or whatnot.

00:37:25.773 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Any moment she wasn't
with him-- and me,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
too, when I wasn't with my
father, every moment, who

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
am I to be working,
what am I thinking.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I should be spending
every moment with him.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And what would you tell
people dealing with that?

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I still haven't resolved that.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Do you have a regret?

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The only
regret I have is,

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
towards the last
days of his life,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I could see energetically
he was not there.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I intuitively knew
he was at the end.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And I went into an anger.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what
are we doing here?

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I regret that, because now
I look back, and that's a stage,

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:90%
it's a normal stage.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm such a doer, I'm
like, what are we doing here?

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And I am ashamed of that.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.372 align:middle line:84%
Like, what do you mean,
what are you doing here?

00:38:19.372 --> 00:38:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Like, what are we doing, Dad?

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing, Dad?

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like that, but
it was in my own mind

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:90%
I was saying that.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking at my dad.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's talking
and having conversations,

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and there's my dad dying.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was so surreal
that I-- and I

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:84%
had my laptop because things
were blowing up at work.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this
is too surreal.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.070 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Something about this
moment is wrong.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I stopped
everybody, and I said, look,

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
this is just too surreal.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I have the laptop, and the
nurse is talking about what type

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:84%
of medication he wants to die
with, and someone over there

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:90%
is on the phone.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, ugh.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.623 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I had a moment.

00:38:59.623 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I have a regret
about that moment.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.228 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to work
with that regret?

00:39:03.228 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We can do a little ceremony,
if you're up for it.

>>LISA: Please.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.705 align:middle line:90%
I brought some stones with me.

00:39:09.705 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You brought--

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: From the No
Regrets Project, just for you.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:90%
You brought a Show and Tell.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: I did, I did.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.575 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
give you this stone,

00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and then I want you
to pick two other ones

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.446 align:middle line:90%
to work with right now.

00:39:24.446 --> 00:39:25.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:26.635 align:middle line:90%
These two.

00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So let's just
work with that black stone

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So with the black
stone, the regret

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.820 align:middle line:84%
is something you regret
doing or something

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:90%
you regret not doing, right?

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, regret
tricks us into thinking

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.060 align:middle line:90%
we've missed something.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to create a
little expansion in your energy

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:84%
field so that that regret
can get a little bigger.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to close your eyes
and step back into that anger.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: That just
surreal situation.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And your regret for even
getting into that situation.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And just let it grow in your
system, and like how shocking

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was wrong.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It was wrong.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So blow that into
the stone right now.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.735 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:84%
No, I want you to put that
stone right up to your face

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.478 align:middle line:90%
and blow it like [BLOWING].

00:40:20.478 --> 00:40:27.202 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [BLOWING]

00:40:27.202 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's good.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: helps.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's good.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you give me
the black stone,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.102 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you another stone.

00:40:36.102 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:90%
You OK?

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes,
regrets do fool us.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But every time we regret,
we have a regret on action

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:84%
we took, in your case, that
we regret, we learn a lesson.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.075 align:middle line:84%
Can you think a lesson you might
have learned from that regret?

00:40:58.075 --> 00:40:58.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:58.875 --> 00:41:00.292 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: OK,
what might that be?

00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Patience.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Patience.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And to be instead of
need to figure it out.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it was--

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it is just the typical
response in the moment,

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
There was something wrong
there that wasn't being voiced.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing,
is to use my voice when

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.450 align:middle line:90%
things are just wrong.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a hot topic for me.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Use your voice.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a hot topic for me.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When I see
injustice and wrong,

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that's why I do what I do.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: OK.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And you do all this
work because of that.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So the lesson you
take from that regret

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:84%
is you'll be
stronger and better--

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

So I want that speech

Just take a couple

speak your truth, right?

You can do it.

let your grief just come up.

own ritual around it.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.275 align:middle line:10%
It has the practices
inside of it.

00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I love this.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Be
grateful every day.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Trust, take the risk.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to take a
risk, you know, step in there

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:90%
and trust it.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Have the courage to
be me, and choose joy.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.060 align:middle line:10%
But in the center
is love myself--

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And share it.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: --and share it.

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, this is beautiful.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:17.560 align:middle line:84%
What a wonderful gift to
give someone who is grieving.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Because again, it's--

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I know I keep saying this, but
it gives purpose to grieving.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.576 align:middle line:90%
It gives motion.

00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Mhm.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Motion.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, this
is why we use breath.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: That's
not accidental.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That helped.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: This is the energy.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And we use stones--

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.340 align:middle line:84%
this is from Peru, the
high mountains of Peru--

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:84%
because stones
hold wisdom for us.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to remember
which is the lodestone

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:90%
or which is the joy stone.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:84%
They all just hold
your essence for you.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you need to move
something like your grief,

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:84%
just to get a little space,
you can blow it into a stone

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and then put it on an altar, or
in your purse or on your desk.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Any stone.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: So that's
just a little part.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And rituals are easy
to create, but probably

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.980 align:middle line:90%
a little forethought helps.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yes.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.660 align:middle line:90%
A little preparation.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It ceremonializes
something and gives it meaning.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it starts
the closure process.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even if
there wasn't closure

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in that situation with the
funeral of the suicide.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.983 align:middle line:84%
Did that family begin some type
of closure from that process?

00:46:29.983 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: They began.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a long road.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: But what happens
is you move the guilt

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.380 align:middle line:10%
a little bit out of the way.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You move the things
that will stop you

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.800 align:middle line:90%
from grieving ritually.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.610 align:middle line:90%
The anger.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: A lot of people are
angry when there's a suicide,

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.470 align:middle line:84%
or feel guilty that they
didn't see it coming.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And those are
emotions that we want to move.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:84%
They're real, but we want to
move them so that the grief can

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:03.220 align:middle line:90%
come in and be truly expressed.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How can we help
others like my mom, where

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to help her grieve,
but yet she's not necessarily

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:90%
ready for it right now?

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's in the doing
of the memorial and all.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Right.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.815 align:middle line:10%
Everybody grieves differently.

00:47:20.815 --> 00:47:21.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Respect your mom, and
respect her grieving process.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.150 align:middle line:10%
It will be very different
six months from now,

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:10%
when there's no plans
for a funeral or taking

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:36.700 align:middle line:10%
care of the last will and
the estate, things like that.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Maybe share some rituals where
you and your mother can create.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.790 align:middle line:10%
Maybe going out on a
walk to a special place.

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:43.850 align:middle line:10%
That's a ritual.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Going to
sit on a bench that's

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.750 align:middle line:84%
a special place,
that's a ritual.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.250 align:middle line:10%
Make it a ritual
so that you do it.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.540 align:middle line:10%
And I always tell everyone,
on the anniversary

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.630 align:middle line:10%
of your father's
death, plan ahead.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Have
a ritual in mind.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're by yourself,
be aware that the energy

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.480 align:middle line:84%
that that anniversary can
really lay you low with grief.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So have a ritual in order
to expect the grief.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I know you're coming, so we're
going to celebrate together.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like what?

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:19.990 align:middle line:90%
What could we do?

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, I take a
three-day retreat on the--

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:90%
my mother died on a Friday--

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.350 align:middle line:84%
she went into a coma on
a Friday on her birthday,

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and she died on a
Sunday, a three-day.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Every year, I take
a three-day retreat.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Nobody interferes with that.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.070 align:middle line:90%
No work.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every year.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Every year.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, I would,
you know, talk to my mom,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'd read her journals,
and I'd put pictures up,

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and I'd cook her favorite soup.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aw.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: But
after 15 years now,

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it's my mom coming
to take care of me.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: I get to rest.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I get to do something, maybe
go get a manicure or something

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:90%
fun.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.142 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: And I hear my mom.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:90%
She's taking care of me now.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: So grief shifts.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It changes.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's our time together.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And people, because we think
we have to get over grief,

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that's not true.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't get over grief,
we get better at it.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But we don't usually get
over a really important loss.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's living
with dying and with grief.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Exactly.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go away.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: No.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And our goal as an organization
is help people build resilience

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.610 align:middle line:90%
while living with loss.

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a maternity
leave and a paternity leave,

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:84%
but there's not necessarily
a grieving leave.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: No.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.678 align:middle line:84%
For those of us that have
to get back to work, and--

00:49:54.678 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:84%
although I love what I do
and this doesn't really

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.745 align:middle line:84%
work for me, but it's actually
helpful for me to be here.

00:49:59.745 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Of course.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, to do this.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:03.558 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: And get
back in your routines.

00:50:03.558 --> 00:50:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To talk with people
like you, I mean, my goodness.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: How did this happen?

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because
we had this interview

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
scheduled several months before,
and it happened this time.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What can people do?

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that you have, you
know, Conscious Transitions,

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:90%
you have a program, a workshop.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:26.060 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you teach,
or how do you take people

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:90%
through this process?

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Well, we work a
lot with hospice workers,

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.420 align:middle line:84%
medical workers, doctors,
nurses, psychiatrists.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We help them language death and
create a different relationship

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:90%
with death.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We also work with
the general public,

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.760 align:middle line:84%
helping them language
death in a different way.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're running
a program this year

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.100 align:middle line:84%
called Conscious Transitions,
Preparing Your Literal

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Documents.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.190 align:middle line:10%
And this started in January.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I decided I was going to
get my documents rewritten.

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:90%
They're getting sort of old.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.730 align:middle line:10%
And I thought,
well, I'm just going

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.810 align:middle line:10%
to take all our subscribers
through with me.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And every month,
something appears.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So the first month, it was
just conversations about death.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And then a friend of
mine died, and I had

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to help her in the hospital.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.230 align:middle line:10%
I was her medical agent.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:10%
And so the next month, I wrote
about you need a medical agent.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You need to appoint
someone who's strong--

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: --and can help you.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And you need--

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can make
those decisions.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: --to tell
them what you want.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: And
then last month, I

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:10%
was starting on the
medical directives.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, choosing different
medical procedures,

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:90%
or not choosing them.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And then this month
was on solace care.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is comfort care,
like what kind of songs

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.970 align:middle line:10%
do you want to hear
as you're dying

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:10%
or who do you want
at your deathbed,

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.160 align:middle line:10%
and is there a ritual you want.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: So next month,
it'll be funeral planning.

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing this
all for myself.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.405 align:middle line:90%
So I'm writing--

00:52:02.405 --> 00:52:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For your own funeral.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.200 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: For my
own funeral, but I'm

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.000 align:middle line:10%
coming up with
questions that might

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.220 align:middle line:10%
help other people
like, oh, yeah,

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.955 align:middle line:10%
like maybe I should
visit a mortuary

00:52:11.955 --> 00:52:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and go figure out what this is.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.432 align:middle line:10%
That's really scary for people.

00:52:16.432 --> 00:52:18.140 align:middle line:10%
But I've got to tell
you, mortuary people

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.740 align:middle line:10%
get very excited when people
show up who aren't grieving,

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:10%
just to chat.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.188 align:middle line:84%
They're like oh,
wow, this is fun.

00:52:26.188 --> 00:52:27.355 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is the process.

00:52:27.355 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: This is the process.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:52:29.385 --> 00:52:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: So we do
different things.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.810 align:middle line:10%
We sort of mix it up.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:35.900 align:middle line:10%
We have teachers
all over the country

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.210 align:middle line:10%
that are doing workshops.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:42.285 align:middle line:10%
And we're creating ceremony
and doing our own thing.

00:52:42.285 --> 00:52:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amazing.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have a whole
institute here in Boulder.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's the Living and--

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: Dying
Consciously Project.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Consciously Project.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:10%
And you can visit
our website site

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:58.610 align:middle line:10%
at
livinganddyingconsciously.org.

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.260 align:middle line:10%
We're all shamanic
practitioners.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That helps.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: And we're
all about rituals

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:10%
and helping people
live life consciously,

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.290 align:middle line:10%
with lots of joy and energy.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that you brought
this aspect in of planning

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.950 align:middle line:90%
your own transition.

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it super
helpful for your loved ones,

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:84%
but it also honors
the way that--

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.260 align:middle line:84%
it takes the fear out
of it for you, in a way.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Mhm.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Dannion Brinkley, who is
an amazing advocate of hospice

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and has created the Hospice
Projects and so forth, he told

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:84%
me about a frequency
on YouTube that

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:middle line:90%
is an eight-hour-long loop.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.675 align:middle line:90%
And you just type in 528 Hertz.

00:53:42.675 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Wonderful.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's the frequency
of the earth and of love.

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency just
played next to my dad's head

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.810 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was aligning,
and it's said

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:57.950 align:middle line:84%
to align the DNA with
that frequency of love.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:90%
So he was at peace.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Aw.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we
had that going on.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really--

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.410 align:middle line:84%
we created our own ceremony,
if you look back at it.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: You did.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was an
amazing experience.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: You did.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I thank you for
letting me come and process

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.670 align:middle line:84%
this with you, and with my
wonderful family online.

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:19.500 align:middle line:90%

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.292 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My wonderful
"Inspirations" family.

00:54:21.292 --> 00:54:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing this with me

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and allowing me to go through
this process with you.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.833 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:27.833 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: I wish you
luck this weekend.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, this will help because--

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Go forward.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --I wasn't able
to write the eulogy.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get it out.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.413 align:middle line:84%
I was writing dates
and statistics,

00:54:36.413 --> 00:54:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is like,
this wasn't him.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.122 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's not a eulogy.

00:54:39.122 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:90%
A eulogy is a story.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is.

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah, tell a story.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Laugh.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Tell a lot of jokes.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get those--

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I've got to text
my brother tonight,

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:84%
ok we need George Carlin,
we need like the good--

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARDS: We need
some good jokes.

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.465 align:middle line:90%

>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.119 align:middle line:90%
Those people need to laugh.

00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:57.244 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's going to go
over well in the church.

00:54:57.244 --> 00:54:58.696 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: It will.

00:54:58.696 --> 00:54:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It will.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all good with me.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.207 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think you've
kind of explained this,

00:55:04.207 --> 00:55:08.020 align:middle line:84%
but what is the biggest why
that you do what you do?

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARDS: Heart connection.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.540 align:middle line:10%
I wake up every morning and
want to make a heart connection

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.150 align:middle line:10%
with the people I'm working
with or the people I'm

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:21.640 align:middle line:10%
working-- you know, visiting
my family, with you.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's finding ways
to make our connection

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.107 align:middle line:90%
through ritual and ceremony.

00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That you do.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARDS: That's my why.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:30.628 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
have given me that.

00:55:30.628 --> 00:55:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

welcome so much.
