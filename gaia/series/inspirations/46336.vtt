00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and we are broadcasting
from the Conscious Life Expo

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Many of you know
Dannion Brinkley

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
as the guy who was struck
by lightning three times

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.215 align:middle line:90%
and lived to tell about it.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:84%
He documents these
near-death experiences

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in his book series
"Saved By the Light,"

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
"At Peace in the Light,"
and "Secrets of the Light."

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And then since then, Dannion
has embraced the ability

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate people
during their last weeks,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
their last days, their
last moments of their life.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
He has been a hospice
volunteer for 30 years,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and he has assisted hundreds of
thousands of people transition

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:90%
from this life into another.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So my biggest question for you,
Mr. Brinkley, what have you

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:90%
learned?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.575 align:middle line:84%
What have you learned
from the bedside

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds of
thousands of people?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.168 align:middle line:84%
>> DANNION BRINKLEY:
Well, thousands.

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:03.959 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thousands.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.037 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:10%
I think what we take away,
like, I'm 64 years old.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:10%
I was born in 1950, and I grew
up just like any other American

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
and served in the Marine Corps.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
And one day I'm
talking on the phone,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:10%
and I discovered that
we are great, powerful,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:10%
and mighty spiritual beings.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:10%
We have dignity, we have
direction, and we have purpose.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that could
ever go wrong in your life

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.298 align:middle line:84%
is somehow you've
allowed something

00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:90%
to affect your dignity.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.616 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And with that
piece of knowledge,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, and to watch
how what we now

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
know to be the near-death
experience-- remember,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I had this puppy when Raymond
had not written his book.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
I'm famous today is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I saw what appeared
to be future events.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But Raymond Moody, who wrote
the book "Life After Life," who

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
coined the term
near-death experience,

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
was a medical student in the
hospital they brought me into.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.915 align:middle line:84%
Patient unconscious, patient
not breathing, no EKG.

00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you were one of the
subjects that he was studying.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And I became one of
those subjects because he heard

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
about it, it moved
through the hospital,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and he heard about it.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I came into this knowing
what a near-death experience

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:90%
was once I met Raymond.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.005 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience
with no way to look at it.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I ran into, Lisa,
was I was going crazy

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
until I met Raymond.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Because how can you come
back in a body of pain?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Struck by lightning,
dead for 28 minutes,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
completely paralyzed
for six days,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed
for seven months,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
two years of learning
to walk and feed myself,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and moving in
dimensional realities

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that I have no earthly idea
what this was, how it worked,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
but I could see
patterns and events.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And then when I met Raymond, I
found a certain peaceful place

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.709 align:middle line:84%
that that was the first
struck by lighting

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.625 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I found a peaceful place.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.485 align:middle line:84%
But what I found,
more important,

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
was there were some
really great people

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
out there who had
great stories, and they

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
were stories that were so
spiritually inspirational.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet they couldn't tell them
because they'd been browbeaten

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
or they'd been fundamentalized
or the Catholics told them

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
they were going to hell,
and the Jewish mother

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
thinks they need to
be a doctor, and god.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was somebody
had to defend those people.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had to say, OK,
somebody better take up

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that mantle and give
that voice to people

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:90%
whose stories need to be told.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So because you
went through this traumatic

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.635 align:middle line:84%
experience not once, not
twice, but three times--

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I had it coming.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's ever
happened to me, I deserved it.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why do you say that?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.113 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, because I do.

00:03:52.113 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I got away with something.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later
the spiritual laws,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.464 align:middle line:84%
as your knowledge of them
grows, you become responsible.

00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Tell me about that.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You lived a prior life,
a whole prior life.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.324 align:middle line:90%
You were in the military?

00:04:06.324 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: United
States Marine Corps.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But that had nothing
to do-- that was just

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
another outlet for insanity.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
religious belief.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in fundamentalism.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes to hell
where I came from, OK?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
Done deal.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been told I was
going to hell since I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:84%
was five years old,
because I basically

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't give a damn if
the sun didn't come up.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I just was not interested in
the world that was around me,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was
surface and superficial.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:90%
This is as a kid.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Why so much--
was it hate or was it just

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.322 align:middle line:90%
intolerance?

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I think it's
just I was probably a prick

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.238 align:middle line:90%
in the last life.

00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I got this just
nature of prickdom.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it's
my basic characteristic,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and so I gave up religion.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It was nonsense.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the '60s, OK?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we always say what we
dreamed of doing in the '60s

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
we in my generation are
dedicated to achieving it

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.977 align:middle line:90%
in our 60s.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And
that's my battle cry.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.873 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So I went into--
played sports because I was

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.963 align:middle line:84%
going to get laid on Friday
if I scored a touchdown.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:14.965 align:middle line:90%
And this was me.

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm redneck, I
don't have any cosmic ideas

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
about anything, and
it's stupid anyway,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And that nature is the nature
that served in the Marine Corps

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and operated in that proxy
war world of the United

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:90%
States and those issues.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm talking on
the telephone one Wednesday

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.746 align:middle line:84%
afternoon in a
thunderstorm, and it hit me

00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in the side of the head,
and it went down my spine.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It welded the nails of the
heels of my shoes to the floor.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.357 align:middle line:84%
It throws me in the air, and
it suspends me in the air,

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and it slams me back
down on that bed.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.353 align:middle line:84%
I am burning, and I am on
fire like battery acid.

00:05:58.353 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I cannot move.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
As a Marine, I could not
get to a defensive position.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I could not move to find a
corner or a weapon or something

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
in a defensive position.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
my mindset works.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.922 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I lift up out of my body.

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:15.244 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Much better
from up there, huh?

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Honey, it did
not matter where I was,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.669 align:middle line:84%
it was better than
where I just left.

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.126 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK?

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
That's all my mind
was thinking, Lisa.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I can see.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything's calm.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.145 align:middle line:90%
We're going along good.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I look down and see my
body across the bed,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.055 align:middle line:84%
and I'm no more interested in
that than the man in the moon.

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't interested in that.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did you feel
that expansiveness?

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.989 align:middle line:84%
Did you go down the
tunnel, the light?

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: That's after.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.097 align:middle line:90%
First you move.

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:90%
This happens to everybody.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mm hmm.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So
here's the fun part.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the takeaway.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.259 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to die.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.929 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ever?

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Never.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You never die?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, if you're
on stage as a comedian,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.525 align:middle line:84%
you die probably a
little bit every night.

00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Or if you were
doing an interview

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.669 align:middle line:84%
and it's a damn dead
interview, OK, you

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:90%
probably die a little bit too--

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Die inside, yeah.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.246 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --hoping that
fool is going to say something,

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
right, or hoping I
don't embarrass you, OK?

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, the
spiritual part of this

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.805 align:middle line:90%
is we're energetic.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:21.854 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.854 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And because of quantum-- now I'm
leaping, but because of quantum

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
dynamics and where
science and spirituality

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
are merging-- whether they like
it or not, they're merging.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: They always have.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I had the same
experience in an accident

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and completely lifted out my
body, saw the whole scene,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
felt everyone's feelings,
could feel their emotions,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:90%
never wanted to go back.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:90%
It was so blissful.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.191 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Oh,
it doesn't go away.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Crystal clear, yeah.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.991 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But then you'd
never have that magnificent

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
husband and that beautiful child
and some of the best friends

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.585 align:middle line:84%
and people who love you
more than life itself.

00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:59.085 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
what pulled me back.

00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:00.039 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I could see the cord
attached to the husband I

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
hadn't even married yet and
had actually broken up with

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
he had it coming.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you went through
this experience of this

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:90%
incredible oneness.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
How did that lead you to
the bedside of hospice?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%
How did you bridge that gap?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
What happened between those
two major parts of your life?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Let's look at
it from a non-spiritual side.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Let's completely
take Dandy Dan out of it,

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
and let's look at it from
a jerk's point to view.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
When you lift out
of your body and you

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
observe that you're no longer
a part of that system--

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.405 align:middle line:84%
I went and actually studied
the system once I got

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
finished going through
the experience--

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
when you hear the chimes and
you go down the tunnel, you

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
become-- myself, because
mine was a combat mentality,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at everything
to see what it is

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and how to position
myself and where safety is

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and where my thought patterns
are, this being of light that

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
comes.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is you
will see your entire life

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
pass before you in a
360-degree panorama called

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:90%
the panoramic life review.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be broken
down into these components,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to see it from
a second person point of view

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
so that when you look
at that point of view,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see how
close you've got to the goals

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:90%
you've set for yourself.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
You realize instantly that
nothing you've ever done

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:90%
was wrong.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It just, in the
section of the goals

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
you set for you to
achieve in this lifetime,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
you didn't get but
this close, you know?

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's where you grow from.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.164 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to literally
become every person that you

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
ever encountered,
and you're going

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to feel the direct results of
your interaction between you

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and that person.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's when
I decided I wasn't

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
going to hit myself
in the face anymore.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'd gone
through this system

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and it showed me what's
really going to happen,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I had better change
at that moment.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So anybody that
you ever impacted negatively

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
or positively, you
felt those feelings.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.085 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I became them.

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You became them.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:08.936 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, say it didn't have any
spirituality to it at all.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.045 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: That was it.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That was
all you needed.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: That's all.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And then the point was this.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Judgment.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
If the divine or if God
could not come today

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and God sent you, in the
life you just reviewed,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
what difference did
you and God make?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that is as plain,
Lisa, and as simple English

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
as this is what's
going to happen.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You either embrace
it or you don't.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it doesn't matter.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been through it
three times and been

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:90%
with 2,000 people studying this.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what's going to happen.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The takeaway from what we're
trying to establish here

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
is a reality perspective
based on how far away you

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:58.602 align:middle line:84%
are from a male being 76.4
and a female being 81.2.

00:10:58.602 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Meaning?

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And ever how
far you are from that date is

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:84%
the measurement of you paying
attention to what I'm saying.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So being your end of
life, the life expectancy--

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Of you as
a male and a female.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided to do with me,
and if God couldn't come today

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and God sent me and the
life I just reviewed,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
what difference did
me and God make?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.244 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were going
to have some fun.

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:23.165 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: If I didn't
die, and I didn't go to hell,

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:90%
you can kiss my ass.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because you're
here to make a big,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:90%
big impact at this point?

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.946 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, no.

00:11:31.946 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Mine was just to
defend those people who

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the confidence and
the belief in the event that

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%
happened to them.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.425 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:38.425 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
defend them, and I

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
was going to create a
portal that if you think

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
those people are crazy--
it's oxygen brain

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.535 align:middle line:84%
deprivation or it's
temporal lobe seizures

00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
or it's some kind of shock
or anesthesia reaction.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe
unequivocally that some

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
of those times that's
exactly what's happening.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
There's too much science
to not benefit that

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.085 align:middle line:84%
as a possible theory in cases
I have personally heard myself.

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But if you think
that that's all there is,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to deal with you.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: There is
no possible way.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The stories are
too coincidental.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.717 align:middle line:90%
They're too miraculous.

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: They have
their basic anomalies

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%
in the structure.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I've been through three of them.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
What do I care
whether anybody thinks

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that there's such thing as
a near-death experience?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who thinks
that I don't think it

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
based on my life
history is an idiot.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't believe it
based on my life history,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.295 align:middle line:90%
I would be an idiot.

00:12:30.295 --> 00:12:32.878 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Why do you think it had
to happen to you three times?

00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
thought about that?

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You
know what, Lisa?

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I always have a joke about it.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when you sit
alone by yourself

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's structured
in such a way

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that I've watched it unfold,
I saw it 38 years ago,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and I've just watched it,
and I've done what I thought

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:90%
was my part.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the cost was, I
did what I thought was my part.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.516 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
people-- they say, Dan,

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
why do you think
you were chosen?

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, I know that answer.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:90%
They were desperate.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: They had
completely run out of messiahs.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You were the closest
to the lightning at the time.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.858 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah,
they said, OK, listen,

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
let's go kill Dannion, and
let's pile this stuff off on him

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and see what that
jackass is made of.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when I look, my
relationship with the divine,

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
when you see me and you
know me, when people say,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Dannion, how are
you doing today?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:90%
I woke up and there was air.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: After
that, we were cooking.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: What's up, God?

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's party today.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided to do, I said,
OK, if me and God couldn't come

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
today, huh, what
are we going to do?

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is my skill set?

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid of death.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I can look at it and
know what's next,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and I can watch
the life as I watch

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:90%
the things that people need.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs someone
to understand them

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and to appreciate and admire
something in their life

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and maybe, if graced to be,
that they inspired something.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I know how to
bring that out of a person

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
so that they can hear
themselves talk about the value.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they need
is a structure of closure.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And how you structure
closure is giving value

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to things in your life and
allowing them to tell it,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because, really, they're
internally processing.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And next is the
structure of permission.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
When you have those three
systems in place, which

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is what I call the
Twilight Brigade--

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I studied this for so long, and
I've been dead so many times,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard every
story there is.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I'm sure.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.601 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And I've watched
people go from this world

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to the next and looked
at the family dynamics,

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and I created the
Twilight Brigade.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's a weekend
project that people

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
can go on the Twilight
Brigade or Dannion and see,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's about taking
the stuff that I

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
talk about to the street.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't just talk this story.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I go do this story.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah, you do.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: And why?

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, no, one
of my questions is why,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
when you live your life
not being afraid of death,

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.125 align:middle line:84%
as every American is the number
one fear is the fear of dying--

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: No,
public speaking.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.805 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Public
speaking and then dying.

00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Public speaking's number one.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And then taxes.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you live
your life that way,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:90%
how do you live differently?

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you live challenging death?

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Do you live not caring?

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
What is it like to live
without a fear of death?

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You learn
the art of appreciation.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Instead.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I have
to lose 20 pounds.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at myself
in the mirror and I say,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to lose 20
pounds, the first thing

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.834 align:middle line:84%
I think about is how many
lobsters I ate to get there.

00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:48.682 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK?

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And did I enjoy getting
that 20 pounds, OK?

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And if I did, OK.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't, then I
will detox along with it.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I will take a detox
and drink, because I

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.612 align:middle line:84%
try to keep that harmony
and balance in myself.

00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you're not
afraid of death,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
it's always just about
internalizing you.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you're not
afraid of death,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
if God couldn't come today and
God sent me, what difference

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
in the life I just reviewed
that me and God made?

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Me and my God, we
was at the bedside.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.456 align:middle line:84%
We was holding
those coming home.

00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Where two or more gather in my
name, so shall I be among you.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.554 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:28.595 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I will be there.

00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I like
that kind of talk.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I like it when
Jesus gets into it

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and Jehovah and
Krishna and Allah.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Come on down.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So I get a chance to know that
I'm going to be that person

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm bringing that
sense of safety and comfort

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and continuity into their life.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there in grace
and honor and in service

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to give them the art form that
I know that you go through.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I know how you
live here, how you

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
go through that, how you get
over there, how you come back

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
from there, you come back
through that, and you get up.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know that as well as
anybody who lives on the Earth,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:84%
except maybe one yogi in
the mountains in Nepal

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
living in a cave
with a bearskin on.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
That fool might be out there.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you about the
idea of all the stories

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
that you've heard what
is the most common thing

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that you hear people say
when they're facing death

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
or they're facing the end of
life or those last moments?

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.898 align:middle line:84%
What is it that they
regretted the most?

00:17:37.898 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: A lot of times
it's not about regret.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:90%
It's never listening.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's never caring enough to
participate in a person's life,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and that you could see that
you instilled loneliness.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
subpsychological nature

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:84%
of whatever the
conversation is, Lisa,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's not for this
show, I can watch people

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.966 align:middle line:90%
from a place that's empathic.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I have been there.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:90%
You can say I know how you feel.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.674 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't know
how anybody feels.

00:18:08.674 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Anytime people says
I know how you feel,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:90%
that's a fool talking.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But I've been close
enough to understand

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
where you are as
you're emotionally

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.545 align:middle line:90%
structuring through it, OK?

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
What people want to do
is about being lonely.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they blame
themselves for what

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
happened in incidents in
their life, especially

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:84%
when their love was
emotionally challenged.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Why did he do this?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Why did my daughter act crazy?

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Why are they fighting?

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to take
care of my husband?

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to take
care of my wife?

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And then what we
call in my world

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
the California sisters--
in South Carolina,

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
there would be a sister
who lived in California,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.415 align:middle line:84%
and she'd fly back
into South Carolina.

00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And this sister's
been with their mother

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
for two years, all the
way through the part.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Then the California sister comes
in and yells at the doctors

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:90%
and goes through all that.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:90%
We have to save her.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about her guilt,
and it's about her being

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:90%
felt alone or left or abandoned.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Most people in this structured
age group and in your age group

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
deal with their parents
leaving them as abandonment.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.465 align:middle line:84%
Then it has nothing to
do with that person.

00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the inner
nature of the ego of the child

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:90%
or parent or friend.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.435 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And the unresolved
emotions and conversations.

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Of their own.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wishes they
had five more minutes.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.795 align:middle line:84%
I created the Twilight
Brigade to allow those

00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:90%
five more minutes.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Tell me about
Twilight Brigade.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
What can you do when
you participate in it?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: It's easy.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
First you have to realize
you're ready to face death,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:90%
good, bad, or indifferent.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So then a person has to
psychologically structure

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
a reason or a rationale
to go forth in it.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: This is how the
mental human being thinks, OK?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You have a mental human
being called the physical.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you have an
ethereal perspective.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Emotions are opinions.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
People think emotions
are some cosmic value.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an attitude you
have about something

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and how much you
like it or don't

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.354 align:middle line:84%
like it is what
creates emotions.

00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:17.645 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Emotions are opinions.

00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.381 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You either laugh
or you cry in an emotion,

00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:90%
or somebody hurts your feelings.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.866 align:middle line:84%
But you had to
structure the psychology

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:90%
to have your feelings hurt.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody tells me that
it emotionally upset them,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:90%
that's never true.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
You're mad about
something or you're

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
happy about something
or something didn't

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:84%
happen that you
thought you deserved.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
emotion comes from.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Now give me a structure
that you believe

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that I can't fit whatever
you're emotionally upset

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
about within that criteria.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Fill in the blanks.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll always be right.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I might miss 1 out of 50.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:90%
But you learn it in end of life.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You watch people in
the end of their life

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and look at what their crisis
are and what the decisions are,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and what you do is you
realize that way up here, 20

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
years from the dance,
I have the opportunity

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at those
things, those events

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and change my life now.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Because it changed my life.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The way
you lived your life.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
someone that you

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
come across that is
being a jerk or who

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is being that prick, as
you called it earlier?

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to that
person who's really an abuser

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:84%
or is treating somebody
completely unfairly?

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you get into their face?

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: No.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why not?

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Because, first,
it's not about me, OK?

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not about me.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's about me caring
about the person that

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.695 align:middle line:90%
has six months or less.

00:21:48.695 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm so specific, Lisa.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
People think I'm crazy, but
I'm just like a laser beam.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.239 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I focus.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
It's never about me.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It's about that person.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's going around
it, I will deal with it.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I will deal with it
in such a way that

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
honors whatever that person's
reasons is for doing it,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
because maybe the woman
beat him when he was child,

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and maybe now is his
first chance to get even.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.444 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I can't
get into all that.

00:22:13.444 --> 00:22:16.156 align:middle line:84%
I just have to neutralize
it as much as I can.

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Now I will be honest
enough to tell you

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had a lady that was 89
years old, and she had cancer,

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and it had moved
throughout the body.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And she told me one time
that her son would lock her

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the closet for when the
postman came so he could get

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
her OxyContin, and
she would go all month

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:84%
without pain medicine, an 89
years old lady with cancer

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
and her grandson.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was over there
that day sitting

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen when he came
in and put her in the closet,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:90%
because you have to sign for it.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
And I beat his ass really bad.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, wow.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So me telling
you my heroic version of not

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
getting into the issues--

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:90%
It's human.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --there's
still another side of me.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's still there.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.953 align:middle line:84%
But when you see something like
that being done that's wrong,

00:23:10.953 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know
that that person

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.697 align:middle line:84%
is going to suffer in the
afterlife anyway, obviously.

00:23:15.697 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, but if you're
going to be every person that

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.352 align:middle line:84%
you've ever encountered,
if you're going to be them,

00:23:21.352 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I forgive them.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:90%
I just try to neutralize it.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But why I like forgiveness is
why should I get between you

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and what you got coming?

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So here in my life,
I created the Twilight Brigade

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.396 align:middle line:84%
so that people could be the
difference that God makes, OK?

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
compassionate therapy,

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's a trained expert field.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You are a
professional end of life.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.262 align:middle line:84%
If God couldn't come
today and God sent you,

00:23:46.262 --> 00:23:48.720 align:middle line:84%
in the life you just reviewed
what difference did God make?

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, for those who
are just about to face

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that system and that
tunnel, let me train you

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
how to be at the bedside
to give them those places

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to structure transition
from this world to the next.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We've trained
almost 6,000 people.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
This technique is the greatest
techniques put together.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It's better than the
Tibetan Books of the Dead.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.131 align:middle line:90%
It's not full of--

00:24:08.131 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, it's
your experience.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's full of your
experience and how

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.594 align:middle line:84%
you are carrying that forward
and teaching other people

00:24:13.594 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to do the same
thing that you are.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't be at the bedside
of every single person.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.775 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But Lisa, in this
new book that Kathryn and I are

00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:24.662 align:middle line:84%
writing, it's called "10
Things to Know Before You Go."

00:24:24.662 --> 00:24:25.245 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:25.744 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:25.744 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So I went to
Mickey Maudlin at HarperOne,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Mickey, I'm
tired of being dead.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.731 align:middle line:84%
Let's write a book
about being alive.

00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Tired of being
the dead guy, huh?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's write about being alive.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So I said, listen, let's
call it "10 Things to Know

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Before You Go."

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: First question--
ask yourself this question--

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:84%
what's the number one cause of
death in America and most other

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:90%
countries?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A heart attack?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Then you turn
to the next page and it says,

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you
thought the answer is,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
the number one cause
of death is birth.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's going to happen.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.097 align:middle line:90%
That is a good point, yes.

00:25:05.097 --> 00:25:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Then you turn
to the next page and it says,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
remember, if you're
breathing, you're leaving.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you just took a
breath, this book is for you.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So what does it
teach us on how to live life,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.066 align:middle line:84%
"10 Things to Know
Before You Go"?

00:25:19.066 --> 00:25:20.815 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Oh, well,
that's in the book.

00:25:20.815 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Talk to me
about a few of them.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, the most
important one is what do you

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.714 align:middle line:90%
appreciate?

00:25:27.714 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You mean the simple
things, life, family?

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: When you see your
life pass before you, Lisa,

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
what always amazes me about
people when I tell you

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see your life
pass before you in a 360-degree

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
hologram and you don't
think that for a minute,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.237 align:middle line:84%
you just listen to the
words, it makes you dumb.

00:25:45.237 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not going to
watch it from a second person

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
point of view based on
this scale and structure,

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.714 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be arrogant, but
people are missing the point.

00:25:52.714 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
the fact that you're

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
going to be everybody that
you've ever encountered,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
then what happens then
is that's really true.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What do you live
your life differently by?

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at life in
terms of your gratitude?

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
What are the gratitude
points of your life?

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:90%
What are you grateful for?

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Air.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Air.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Not the laughter of
your babies or anything?

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.146 align:middle line:90%
It's just breathing.

00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Ah, air.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if I wake up
and I'm breathing,

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I have every opportunity.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I have every
privilege that I would

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.032 align:middle line:84%
hope that an unseen force--
that automatically--

00:26:34.032 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that my body is structured to
automatically create my ability

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:90%
to draw in air.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Once that moment is in place,
I got to feed the thing,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and I have to set my
goals and my intentions,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and I have to serve the
highest good that I think,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that no vet need die
alone in this country.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I have to do.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I have a job.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about the laws
that are being cut off and how

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:84%
the vets are being
treated these days?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that get to you?

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: In a lot of ways.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the system I have, OK?

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I watch health
care, you know, Lisa,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
like everybody, that for 38
years, 36 years on the circuit,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about that
the battle for the souls

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness would
be fought in health care.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I realized that when it
went to the Supreme Court

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that that vision from
1975 and the chip

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
implants and the
Arab-Israeli position, all

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that stuff I wrote about
in "Saved By the Light,"

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:90%
it's all come true.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I watch to
see what happens to Jordan,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:84%
because it said Jordan would
disappear almost as a nation.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I watch that, and
so I watched where

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the Palestinian
settlement will come.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: These were the
insights that came--

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.116 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: These were
the boxes of knowledge

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
in the books.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
See, the thing that
also made Dannion--

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know when you'd had
a near-death experience you

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
wasn't supposed to
tell everything.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, because
I'd never had one,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond taught well, and
he could probe with questions.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:84%
He's a good
interviewer, like you,

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and he would probe
with his questions,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:90%
and I would tell him stuff.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I told him things that
I saw that I believed

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:90%
would happen in the future.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
When they happened, the first
one was, like, four years.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:90%
And Raymond called me, OK?

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because
he had the notes.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.394 align:middle line:90%
He'd written it down.

00:28:28.394 --> 00:28:30.657 align:middle line:90%
Then Chernobyl and then--

00:28:30.657 --> 00:28:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You saw all that?

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.489 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It was completely different
from the spiritual place.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a place that I
was participating in,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that
would happen in the life

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that I would have back here.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when I began
to suspect they

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:90%
were going to send me back.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: See?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I never heard enough near-death
experiences before '75,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
but a heard a bunch
of them after '75.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah?

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
idea of how you're

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:90%
going to die or do you care?

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.215 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what I hope.

00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I hope that they're going to
have a nuclear test somewhere

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:90%
and I get to sit on the bomb.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
that vaporization

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:90%
would be the ultimate rush.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
to go, you know--

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Might as
well get there faster.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You
want to vaporize.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought about
this in the '90s.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I had all these friends, and
when I had the brain surgery--

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in 1997, I had to
have brain surgery,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me an 8% chance
of surviving because I'd have

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
to either have brain surgery and
open heart surgery at the same

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:84%
time, because I had
to have heart surgery,

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
remember struck by
lighting, damaged heart,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.610 align:middle line:90%
open heart surgery, then--

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I remember
when you weren't well.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --brain surgery,
and then another massive heart

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:90%
attack in 2000.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They just got to
keep me interested.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they want
to keep me focused,

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.444 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, listen, let's
just kill him a little bit.

00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just so
he can remember--

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --what it feels like.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:90%
No, keep him on task.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so in that place
where you are continually going

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
back through surgery
after surgery,

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:90%
does it matter to you anymore?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you just go
into that surgery

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:84%
knowing you're going to
get out and your life has

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.026 align:middle line:84%
such a bigger
purpose and that you

00:30:21.026 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:84%
don't need to fret about
things like that, do you?

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.449 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, whatever
the system says is necessary.

00:30:27.449 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
If it's time for me to go,
then it's time for me to go.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.359 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So how do
we live our lives?

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: What you do is you
look at stuff you appreciate.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:90%
You quit being afraid.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.869 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to die.

00:30:36.869 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, quit hearing me say it.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Lock on.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:84%
If you're not going
to die, what happens?

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about
those who have died?

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we bring them back,
if it really doesn't happen?

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Who wants
to bring them back?

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: In our minds,
because we love them?

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Why can't
you go over there to them?

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
We see channels and mediums, OK?

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:90%
The system works both ways.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:90%
It's electrical.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
looking at this.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
You need symbology.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Water, that's the body.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.674 align:middle line:84%
How many people think
of the body as water?

00:31:08.674 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it is.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's 78% water.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
You put some salt in it--
the body's salt water--

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:90%
you've created a body.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You take a candle, a birthday
candle, red, orange, yellow,

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:90%
blue, green, indigo, and violet.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
In the flame of a candle is all
the seven rays of the spectrum.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.701 align:middle line:84%
Now you've created
an energetic body.

00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Now
you have a physical,

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
mental point of reference that
that spiritual being can slow

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%
down and harmonize the
flame and the water.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So they can identify
as a body and they

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:90%
can identity as an essence.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you just need
something that's theirs,

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:84%
something that belongs to
them, because that still

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.070 align:middle line:90%
holds their energy.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But they can also slow
down from over there,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
come through the Akashic
Record, take on the personality,

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.291 align:middle line:90%
and then re-enter this plane.

00:31:58.291 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:59.456 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK?

00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
How you would best do it,
for me if it's not funny

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:90%
it's not spiritual.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:84%
If you want to talk to
me about God or anything

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can't make me laugh,
you can take it somewhere else.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.015 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to hear it.

00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Doesn't
need to be serious.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.565 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: If you've
been where I've been--

00:32:15.565 --> 00:32:17.165 align:middle line:90%
look at my personality, Lisa.

00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Do I seem like somebody
that's scared of dying

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and who's done it
two or three times?

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.567 align:middle line:84%
Listen, that crowd over
there is some party animals.

00:32:25.567 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And they're just
waiting for something to do.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to get
organized enough to get them

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:90%
something to do, OK?

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going over
there, it doesn't really

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.770 align:middle line:84%
matter to me as long as that--
if God couldn't come today

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and God sent me, in the
life I just reviewed

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.780 align:middle line:84%
what difference did
me and God make.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Any time I want to judge that,
any place that that becomes

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.479 align:middle line:84%
the value of my life with
me knowing that, then it

00:32:54.479 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter when it happens.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's how to
live a purpose-driven life.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.033 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter what happens.

00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And look, I was in
hospice yesterday.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I came here, I do these
programs, but I make rounds.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I go visit guys I've
know for years and guys

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to find a cause
and a purpose in our life--

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.395 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Every day, yes.

00:33:13.395 --> 00:33:14.999 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --that
drives the focus.

00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote
"10 Things to Know."

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
What do you appreciate
about today?

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
What do you think someone
appreciated about you?

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:90%
What did you admire today?

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And what did you think somebody
may have admired about you?

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an ego.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a value structure.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
The greatest crisis we make as
mental spiritual beings is we

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.155 align:middle line:90%
never place a value on our love.

00:33:41.155 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Because in English love
is one stupid word, OK?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's tacky.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it in Greek,
it's three words, agape, eros,

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and phila.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:84%
If you look at i in Hebrew,
it's eight or nine words.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Greek, it's three
or four structures,

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:90%
but you have three basic words.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But love is a value of
expression that each of us

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.750 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
expression of that value

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and you focus on
it and it begins

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the measure of
what you appreciate

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that in the value
of someone else,

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and surely someone appreciated
in the value of you.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm a hospice volunteer, and
when people who do hospice work

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.389 align:middle line:84%
come up to me then that
appreciation factor

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:90%
is between the two of us.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:90%
We both do it.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it is a dynamic,
ever-changing thing, love is.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not one word.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can have that dynamic,
ever-changing relationship

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.874 align:middle line:84%
with our loved ones
here, not here.

00:34:42.874 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Anywhere.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Anywhere.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: If one of them
got abducted by an alien,

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:90%
you can still do it.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.572 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You can still do it.

00:34:51.572 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Because
of this simple fact.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
This is proven science, science.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We are all connected
in a matter,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:90%
a mass called dark matter.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
The collider at
CERN in Switzerland

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
has proven the existence of
dark matter, the substance that

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:84%
is calculated that the
universe is suspended in,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's modulated
it on a scale, OK?

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That means that we live in
a multi-dimensional reality

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.799 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
is connected.

00:35:29.799 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That
was seven months ago.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Whose mindset changed
when that heard?

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.436 align:middle line:90%
Mine did.

00:35:36.436 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But whose mindset?

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There is no way we're
not all connected.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.795 align:middle line:90%
It's not mythology anymore.

00:35:41.795 --> 00:35:43.576 align:middle line:90%
It's science.

00:35:43.576 --> 00:35:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's science.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.517 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:35:45.517 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: What did we change?

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We're still dealing with a
religion 2,000 or 3,000 years

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:84%
old instead of that we
are energetic beings.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, most things drive
us to think that we're separate

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and that there's the
Democrats and the Republicans

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.328 align:middle line:84%
and there's this
religion, that religion.

00:35:58.328 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
separatism that's

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.785 align:middle line:90%
fed to us on a daily basis.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.757 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah,
but that's one source.

00:36:03.757 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.629 align:middle line:90%
It permeates cultures, however.

00:36:06.629 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: But you know what?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Not if you see it
for what it is.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I think that we
have that ability to permeate

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.934 align:middle line:90%
cultures with Gaiam TV.

00:36:15.934 --> 00:36:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I do too.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's way
ahead of its time,

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.521 align:middle line:90%
and it's catching up very fast.

00:36:19.521 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of technology
is completely transforming.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The way that people
consume entertainment

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.140 align:middle line:84%
is completely transforming
because it's informational.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And that, I think, is important.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I also, when I had that
near-death experience,

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I felt that web
that you're talking

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:90%
about, that interconnection.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was in
California at the time,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but Asia was
completely manifested

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.252 align:middle line:90%
in front of my awareness.

00:36:46.252 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a feeling that
it just encompassed me.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything that I
had, it wasn't even

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
a thought but of a conscious
wave was right there,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:90%
was right around me.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:84%
In that place of
interconnection,

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
everything manifests
completely instantly.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then when we drop down
into these bodies, these three

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:84%
dimensional bodies, why
does it takes so bloody long

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and why is it such
a struggle to get

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:90%
to that manifestation, Dannion?

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:90%
What is that physical thing?

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.798 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: It's a part of
the system, though, Lisa.

00:37:16.798 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:84%
You come down here
so you can polarize,

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:90%
proton, electron, neutron, OK?

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It's energetic.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:84%
The way we multiply amounts
in this physical reality

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.457 align:middle line:90%
is using nothing.

00:37:33.457 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What do you mean?

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: The 0.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.426 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK?

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, right.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to go
bigger than those numbers?

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:90%
You use nothing.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.685 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You use 0.

00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Nothing.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.813 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But when you think
of that from a spiritual point

00:37:49.813 --> 00:37:50.950 align:middle line:90%
of view, it makes sense.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just God having fun.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
They're up there hanging
around, got nothing to do.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you come down here into
this level of consciousness,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:90%
you have to charge it.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be a
particle charge.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
an identity so we

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:84%
see good and evil,
light and dark, male

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and female, because
these are charges.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything works off
the ground, the neutral.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK, right.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: These are charges.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we are training to be
the difference that God makes.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:84%
If you know of
the divine essence

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and you know that that essence
serves and empowers you, then

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
instead of you depending
on it for all the stuff

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that you have already gained
the responsibility of doing,

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
like being a parent, then why
aren't you supportive of it,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to always demanding
it to save you and all of that?

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:90%
So we come down in this level.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.410 align:middle line:90%
We slow down.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We use words and embraces.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we can measure
the distance between us

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
in charging, which are
feelings, so that you

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
can hug someone and
hold someone and smile

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.845 align:middle line:90%
and laugh with a tear of joy.

00:39:05.845 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It's still an emotion,
but it's an attitude.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Something made you happy.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And that we can interact because
so that when we go back to,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
when we leave this class and
we go back to the other side,

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
we go to a higher
level of consciousness,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe a lower level
of consciousness

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.310 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a lateral
level of consciousness

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because spiritually
we can expand there.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no greater gift
that a spiritual being

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.615 align:middle line:84%
could have that I have seen
that equals to breathing.

00:39:37.615 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:84%
When you can breathe
and that you're

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:84%
functioning in what you now
to know to be a finite system,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.800 align:middle line:84%
what power comes
with the ability

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.329 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish something
in a designated period.

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I have this amount
of time to change the world.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, they better get ready, OK?

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm coming to get 'em.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to do,
Lisa, is lay out, look,

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.785 align:middle line:84%
people can pick
just subject matter.

00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I say that you
never left heaven.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I have two chapters
in the new book.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I say you never left heaven
and I put that argument up.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to win.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I hope so.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Oh, don't worry.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to win.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.335 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I hope so, because a
lot of people treat this like

00:40:26.335 --> 00:40:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it is hell, and they live that
way and create hell for other

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to be
able to explain to us

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:84%
how we're living
this heaven on Earth.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
we're manifesting it.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
When you see a lot of this stuff
that goes on, you cut a deal.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might
need to suffer.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It sounds real good, but
you may need to suffer.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say I'm not
supposed to react to it,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
but you set up the system
when you come here.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You choose to come, and
you're chosen to come.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
The most important
was that you were

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:84%
chosen, that the divine believed
that there was no one better

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:04.015 align:middle line:84%
than you being you to be born at
this particular group of people

00:41:04.015 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:84%
based on to achieve
the divine role.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to
stick your nose in it

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and maybe pick another parent
or a different relative

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
or a sibling or a different
time period over a couple years,

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden you come.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:90%
You're born.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Because your trials and
triumphs are appreciated,

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:90%
admired, or inspired by others.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Look at all of us.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.130 align:middle line:84%
We all appreciate something
or we feel good for them

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:90%
or our heart goes out to 'em.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the linking
interconnection

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.982 align:middle line:90%
between all of the divine.

00:41:38.982 --> 00:41:39.815 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:39.815 --> 00:41:40.523 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: See?

00:41:40.523 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to look at it
from this point of view, which

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is where I look at it
from-- and you do, too.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.685 align:middle line:84%
You just don't live in
it every single day--

00:41:47.685 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And every
single moment, yeah.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --then
is where we're going.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And so down here you get a
chance to express and feel

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:90%
from a distance.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I loved your vision
of what you were talking about

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
on heaven or the other side as
being non-linear and how things

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.350 align:middle line:84%
happen faster,
they happen slower,

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
they happen at different
rates at different times.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But we are in this
right now lifetime here

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
where things do happen
on a linear way.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me how we can
access those other dimensions

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:90%
without having to die?

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Can we pull in those
non-linear dimensions

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and create and manifest
on those other dimensions

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
without actually
losing the body?

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Think of this.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
If I told you about a
candle and a glass of water

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:84%
with some salt in
it, and I told you

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:84%
about having a possession
that was there,

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:90%
I never gave you the punchline.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.753 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So now let
me give you the punchline.

00:42:40.753 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Let's say
that this represented mom,

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and then this represented a
candle to the flame of her

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:51.280 align:middle line:84%
essence, and this was a
little brooch that she had.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd light that candle and I
would sit back consciously,

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.060 align:middle line:84%
because I've created
this structure,

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and I would think of the dumbest
thing that she ever caught me

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
at and the funniest thing
I ever heard her say.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:02.999 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And then when that
candle flickers and goes out,

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in
the dark laughing,

00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and me and my mother are
together and me and my brothers

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.000 align:middle line:90%
or me and my friends.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Because laughter moves
across all planes of power.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not sadness
that drives a focus.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's laughter.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:84%
What did you celebrate
about that life?

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.090 align:middle line:90%
What was celebrated?

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Not I miss you.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And like a lady
asked me, she said,

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.260 align:middle line:84%
"I want to know
if my-- I hate God

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.760 align:middle line:84%
because God took
my mother from me."

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.343 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What
was wrong with her?"

00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, she had brain cancer
and uterine cancer and breast

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.536 align:middle line:90%
cancer."

00:43:36.536 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You're mad that
she's not here with you,

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and you're mad at God for that?"

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Woman, you need to
learn about Jack Daniels."

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.964 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: [LAUGHS] You need
to loosen up a little.

00:43:46.964 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Because
you might as well--

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.270 align:middle line:84%
you either can rationalize
being crazy or you can blame it

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:84%
on alcoholism, because
you crazy, bitch.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:84%
If my mother is in
heaven, she don't

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:00.044 align:middle line:84%
need to come back here and
do a damn thing for me, OK?

00:44:00.044 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Because let me
tell you something.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There's two things I
know about my mother.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:84%
There's not an angel in heaven
that has on dirty underwear.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee if
my mother's there,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.760 align:middle line:84%
there's not an angel in heaven
that has on dirty underwear.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I will guarantee you
there is not a speck of dust

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.526 align:middle line:90%
anywhere on any table in heaven.

00:44:20.526 --> 00:44:22.117 align:middle line:90%
I can guarantee it.

00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: She's still busy.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Momma, cook, girl.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if she's over
there working them,

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm safe over here and I don't
have to deal with it, OK?

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I think about
my mom and my dad,

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and I was there
with them and I saw

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
what they were going
through and I was there

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:84%
with them, the knowledge that
I have about life after death

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and the place that I understand,
when it's about my own family

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.209 align:middle line:84%
and I can watch the interaction
between us in those moments,

00:44:51.209 --> 00:44:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's a
greater gift that I could

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:84%
offer or expound or talk to
people about the Twilight

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Brigade or what Dannion does
and how I am here to support you

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and to support Gaiam
in any possible way

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and how you look at the type of
programming that makes people

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.890 align:middle line:84%
pay every month to
participate in a revolution

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:84%
about not talking about
it but taking advantage

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:84%
of the opportunities, both
electrically, spiritually,

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:21.480 align:middle line:84%
quantum-ly, physics-ly,
and theory-ly,

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.890 align:middle line:90%
not emotionally to react now.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.347 align:middle line:90%
And this is that opportunity.

00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: 2014, it's a
pre-mid-term election cycle

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that sets up the election of a
president of the United States

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.850 align:middle line:84%
in three years that will direct
the destiny of this country.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It will take this country out
of it, it will keep it in it,

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.590 align:middle line:84%
or it will take
it deeper into it.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what faces America.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what faces the world.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And that, coupled
with terror, creates

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.850 align:middle line:84%
a fear-based controlled
reality that no one who's

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:84%
ever been dead looks at
it as anything serious.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:84%
A terrorist is going to
come blow something up?

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are they?

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.300 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Come over to my house.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Bring a bag full
of nails, and make

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
sure you've got enough
TNT that we vaporize.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.074 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You're into
the vaporization.

00:46:22.074 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I love the way that you
talk about your mother

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and you don't cry and
that you don't mourn.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned that the
grief that one experiences

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:90%
is more attached to the ego of--

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --missing that person.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:90%
You made that really clear.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That's
really good, though.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.935 align:middle line:84%
But see, Lisa, this
is the genius of you

00:46:40.935 --> 00:46:43.590 align:middle line:84%
as an interviewer,
because you picked up

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:90%
a subtle thing, a subtle.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Grief.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Bereavement is a process.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It lasts about
three or four weeks.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.260 align:middle line:84%
The first week of the-- first
couple days of the third week,

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like it happened again,
because everybody's gone.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to prepare the family,
and you have to call them.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.341 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell them that you
know they're freaking out,

00:47:06.341 --> 00:47:09.230 align:middle line:84%
but you have to call them and
you have to react to them.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that Gaiam
should teach this series.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.099 align:middle line:84%
I think Gaiam should come on
and let's teach a series about,

00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:17.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's where you are,
here's what's going on,

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and here's why you have
to look at it this way.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Because three weeks after
it, you need to call them,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
to go through it

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.265 align:middle line:84%
and that anxiety's
going to rush on them.

00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
really careful,

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:84%
bereavement, which is
a natural separation,

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:33.590 align:middle line:84%
as we put it in our ideology
and social psychological

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:38.310 align:middle line:84%
equativeness to each
other, becomes grief.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.169 align:middle line:90%
And grief can last a lifetime.

00:47:40.169 --> 00:47:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And grief builds
guilt, and grief builds fear.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Why, in part, I created
the Twilight Brigade was,

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:90%
hey, wait a minute, everybody.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I cannot have you lingering
in grief because you let that

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.080 align:middle line:90%
affect your dignity.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And once your
dignity's affected,

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you will not achieve
the goals you set out

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to do based on you're a
great, powerful, and mighty

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
spiritual being with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.223 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's how you started.

00:48:04.223 --> 00:48:05.264 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:48:05.264 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely agree with you
that the largest segment

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of the population
being over 65, we

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:84%
need to learn how to
deal with departed loved

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:15.630 align:middle line:84%
ones and our own
mortality more than ever.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:18.812 align:middle line:84%
There's more interest and
attention that needs to be paid

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:20.020 align:middle line:90%
to that, because there isn't.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just how do you put
people in a rest home?

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
do about the cost?

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we're
hearing about, yeah.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.786 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But listen,
here's where you are.

00:48:26.786 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:90%
That's not.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:90%
The point is this.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:32.280 align:middle line:90%
10,000 of us turn 65 every day.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.610 align:middle line:90%
How many of it is there?

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.246 align:middle line:90%
There's 81 million of us.

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:36.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a third of
the population.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.453 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, it is.

00:48:37.453 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That's a targeted
market and a demographic

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:90%
that's us.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So the programming
that you're trying to develop

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and bring in these issues is
programs that you're dealing

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.080 align:middle line:84%
with, programs that
I'm dealing with,

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:84%
programs that a third of the
population is dealing with.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
choice but to go there.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And they don't have
this kind of information on how

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.570 align:middle line:84%
to deal with bereavement
the way that you teach.

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
You did, thank you, help us
with a passing loved one.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:84%
You helped my father-in-law
deal with his mother.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I was there at her bedside.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I was able to watch her
communicate with those angels

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the
bells and the chimes

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the loved
ones, and then she

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
would come back and
tell us about it.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It was the most beautiful
experience ever.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:20.570 align:middle line:90%
She died peacefully at home.

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: She passed.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Passed.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Way to
remember-- that word applied

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:31.870 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual ethereal
human being is not a word

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that's a reality.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:33.574 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: You pass.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: She passed.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.780 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.470 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:90%
She passed.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:90%
She just passed.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't painful.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It was at home.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It was just quiet.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.400 align:middle line:84%
She closed her eyes and just
went into another place.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.692 align:middle line:90%
She was visiting it in and out.

00:49:47.692 --> 00:49:49.316 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: It
happens a lot of times.

00:49:49.316 --> 00:49:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Visiting it.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.505 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You have
what's called fey.

00:49:53.505 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's an English
word, but it's

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.760 align:middle line:10%
based on some Greek
thing from Asclepius.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.995 align:middle line:10%
I know the history of
it, but it's boring.

00:50:00.995 --> 00:50:02.109 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: It's boring.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.216 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK?

00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:05.430 align:middle line:90%
But you have fey.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.180 align:middle line:10%
Usually in the
last couple of days

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:10%
a person will come
completely awake.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.375 align:middle line:10%
They'll be cognitive.

00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if they have 50
grams of morphine in then,

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.460 align:middle line:10%
they'll become cognitive because
they come to say goodbye.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when people say
mom's coming home and, god,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.235 align:middle line:90%
they're feeling better.

00:50:23.235 --> 00:50:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But we who do this know what's
happening, and what we do

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is we get people
to pay attention.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, ask them what you can do.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
unresolved business?

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you
want to thank them?

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Great.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.436 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Is there
something you can say that you

00:50:35.436 --> 00:50:37.950 align:middle line:84%
appreciated about them, some
little small thing that they

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.425 align:middle line:84%
may have did in your life that
you can come down and say,

00:50:40.425 --> 00:50:42.951 align:middle line:84%
you know, Aunt Jane or
mom, you may not remember.

00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:45.200 align:middle line:84%
When I was four years old,
you picked me up and set me

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.360 align:middle line:84%
on the washing machine, and you
taped my little bloody foot,

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.675 align:middle line:90%
and I never forgot that.

00:50:49.675 --> 00:50:52.500 align:middle line:84%
That is waves of power and
might to a person that's

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:84%
looking for the
value in their life.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So I heard them when I see fey,
because that's the end of it.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You directed us to do
a celebration of her life while

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.340 align:middle line:84%
she was still there
in front of her.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not she
-- we acknowledged--

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:84%
she didn't acknowledge
us about it,

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:84%
but we gave those moments and
we all sat around for her own

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.980 align:middle line:84%
panoramic life review of all
the awesome moments in her life.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And that's
why she passed in peace.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.235 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:51:16.235 --> 00:51:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.406 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So here's
what we're doing, Lisa.

00:51:18.406 --> 00:51:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about some
probability of something.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.540 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
reality of the art form of that

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.690 align:middle line:84%
if you're breathing
you're leaving.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:30.641 align:middle line:84%
And the number one cause of
death in America is birth.

00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:31.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.681 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:51:31.681 --> 00:51:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And what is the
driver that leads toward that?

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Stress.

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Stress, hypertension,
fear of the unknown,

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:84%
fear of a terrorist,
fear of your banker,

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.680 align:middle line:84%
fear of everything except
Gaiam TV and you and me.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:50.040 align:middle line:90%

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.700 align:middle line:90%
