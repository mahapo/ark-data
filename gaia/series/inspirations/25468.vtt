00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
As our medical costs climb
further out of reach for many

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of us, wouldn't it be wonderful
to have access to someone who

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
could simply look at you,
tell you what's wrong,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and how to fix it.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, these people exist.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:10%
They're called
medical intuitives.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
Today's guest, Carol
Ritberger, is one such person.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Having the ability to see into
the energetic matrix of life

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:10%
was not always easy for Carol.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:10%
But today, she
thrives, and teaches

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:10%
others how to do the same.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:10%
And not to embarrass her, but
I have to say that, Carol,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:10%
you're one of my
favorite people.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
that, not only does Carol see,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and she sees a
tremendous amount.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
She-- she was
looking at the aura

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of the-- the
corporate headquarters

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
here at Gaiam a little while
ago, which was fascinating.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But you see the
beauty in all things.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the really
interesting thing.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
You can find beauty, even
where someone else might

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:90%
see something that is not.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And that-- I think that
is really your gift.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
something for a second.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
This is just a bone
I have to pick,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%
that I want to talk about.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
people like you,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and anyone who
has abilities that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
are beyond the physical,
sensory world, as having a gift.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And my bone to pick is,
I don't see it that way.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I see it, it's you.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the person.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:90%
You've developed it.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Over what course of
time, or whatnot,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
these at your own net--
naturally developed talents

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that you have
brought to the table.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gifted you with it.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And especially because
I died, and that's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:90%
how I came about with it.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.405 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure that was a gift on it.

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:10%
But, the reality is,
we're all intuitive.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And we all have the ability
to see beyond the obvious.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.711 align:middle line:10%
It's just that we don't
all necessarily develop it.

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's right.
When I came back-- It's true.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
When I came back from my
near-death experience,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:90%
my whole world looked different.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.594 align:middle line:90%
Well let's talk about that.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
really the beginning

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
of this part of your story.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's put you in a
time-frame reference,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
so we know, kind of
how long ago this was.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
What your life was
like at the time,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.741 align:middle line:84%
because you were
very left-brained.

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Very.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm a research scientist, and
my education is in personality,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.456 align:middle line:90%
behavioral psychology.

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what
made people tick.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Why we do the things we do.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And so that was my whole focus.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in
the corporate world.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you can't be any
more left-brained than anything

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:90%
in working in that world.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And then I died.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.339 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I died.
And it was--

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, you want to
expand on that a little?

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:90%
I died.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
How did you die?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it-- You know, it's a
story that, even to-- to today,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
after it happened
in 1981, I mean,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
if anybody ever told me I'd
make a living as an intuitive,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I probably would've run
away from them, number one.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.294 align:middle line:84%
And number two, to
be able to see auras,

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
then they would really-- you
know, that would be different.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:10%
But what occurred is that I woke
up in the middle of the night.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say
it, a voice literally

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:90%
woke me up, and said, wake up.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and my
daughter were out-of-town.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was nobody there,
and it was like, hello, I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
must be dreaming.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And this voice said, wake up.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You're having
difficulty breathing.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, well really?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that, because I'm
having difficulty breathing.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:90%
You didn't need to tell me.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was really
stressed, difficult breathing,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
my heart was having
arrhythmia, I

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
was, palpitations, everything.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.085 align:middle line:84%
-You were a young woman.
-I was.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I was only 37-years-old.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, nothing like
this had ever happened.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
allergic reactions.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that we could
ever pinpoint to it.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And so, I laid down back down.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.565 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well this is
just absolutely crazy.

00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't happen.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been a dream,
and I must have just come

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
out of it in a startled state.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And all that rationalization,
as a scientist would do.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I laid back down, and
this voice said, get up now.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I got up, and
I was really-- My body

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
was very, very distressed.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I got up, and this
voice said, go to the hospital.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And the course, me. it's
like, and why would I do that?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And this voice
said, you're dying.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And that'll get your attention.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I tell you, it does.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, typical
of me, I drove

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
myself to the emergency room.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:90%
How were you able to do that?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
I just-- it was almost like--

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
You were on auto pilot

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
There with something
inside that, I just

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
knew that what I was
experiencing, as crazy as it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
may sound, it was
beyond just what was

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.047 align:middle line:90%
happening to my physical body.

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you
intuitively knew that.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I just knew
that this was important.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I needed to do this.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So, drove myself to emergency,
and when I went to register,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the administrator said,
and why are you here?

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm dying.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, excuse me?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm dying.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and how
would you know this?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't say, well
a little voice told me so.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:10%
But what I did
is, I said to her,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm having difficulty
breathing, my heart's rates

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:10%
really irregular, I feel
faint, and so forth.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So, she must have
taken one look,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and got this message so, I
literally-- they took me in,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and put me into emergency.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And this voice said,
it's time to go.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, go where?

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I
was above the whole dynamics

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
of the ER room, watching
me lay on this table.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
we have to go.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And I remember being aware.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the best way to say it.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember being
aware of the noise,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and the-- the people
that were so frantic,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and trying to save me.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.621 align:middle line:10%
And I remember someone
saying, we're losing her.

00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We're losing her.
She's flat-lining.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.197 align:middle line:90%
Get her back.

00:05:49.197 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, bring in whatever.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, and next thing I know,
I remember thinking to myself,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:90%
you haven't lost me.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You're just looking
in the wrong place.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm up here, and what'
happening down there.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of my
sense of humor, which I

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:90%
realize is the dynamics of it.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, next thing I know, I
found myself literally moving

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:90%
at light speed, never afraid.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:10%
There was such a
tremendous sense of peace,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:10%
and resolve, and no
fear in everything.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up, and I remember
them saying, before I left,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:90%
we've lost her.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I knew
what that meant.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing--

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was no emotional
attachment to that--

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.529 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
 --from your position
out of the body?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
None.
None.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
dynamics of a process.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.521 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the-- I guess
I would say, the other side.

00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
supposed to be heavens,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and angels, and everything,
and I ended up in a car wash.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You might want
to expand on that.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I can't
even get the dying part right.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.326 align:middle line:84%
Ya, ba, ba, that whole
part-- part of who I am.

00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
OK.
So, why at the car wash?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I realized, and I
didn't realize it at the time,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:90%
the brain is so magnificent.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It knew that my
physicalness had died.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a four-minute
window from the time we stop--

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
the heart stops that last
breath, that the brain still

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:90%
has activity.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And what it was doing, when we
hear that cliche that your life

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:90%
passes before you, it was true.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And what my brain
was doing was going

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
into my emotional memories,
and pulling up the things

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:90%
that were really important.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Things that would
want me to come back,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:90%
or to bring that life back.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I used to love to go to
the car washes with my dad--

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there it was.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
 --you know, just fascinated
by the whole process.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And-- and it was something
that was comical.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It was humorous.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot of
positive feelings.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard Carol,
Carol, Carol, and I thought,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.765 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh, my mom's here, too.

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:10%
She used to say that to me
when she was always, you know,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:10%
upset with me.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I thought,
well no, that can't be.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I was, kind of,
watching all this dynamics.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way to explain it.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:10%
And these three orbs
came up to me, lights,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and they just hung with me,
and they basically told me

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:10%
that they were going to
stay with me until I made

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:10%
the decision to stay or go.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
in time, I don't

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.460 align:middle line:84%
know how to explain it, because
you really don't say things.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But you telepathically
know things.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking, well,
I'm probably going to stay.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful,
beautiful place.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard my
daughter's voice.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of things my
daughter used to say to me

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:90%
is, Mom, come on.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's go out and play.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that voice, and
that brought me back into body.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I thought
you'd float back, right?

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've decided
to come back.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Slammed back in, and open my
eyes, and couldn't see a thing.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't see a thing.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.203 align:middle line:90%
I was just as blind as can be.

00:08:49.203 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I could hear voices.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I could hear a nurse saying, OK.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
She's awake.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:90%
The doctors were there.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
How are you feeling?
It's like, well, I feel--

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying-- were they
doing those typical shining

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:90%
lights in your eyes?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to do the lights.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to figure out where

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I was, from a
body-functioning standpoint,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
where my breathing
was, the heart rate,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:90%
it was extremely fast.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying to
them, close the blinds.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Turnout the lights.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't see.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
I can hear you, but I can't see.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And little did I know, they
said, well, after a while,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Carol, this'll pass.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was just the fact
that you-- The best they

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
said is that I had a seizure.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And that the seizure
caused my heart to stop.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:10%
And, as a result of that, they
had to really be aggressive,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:10%
because I was actually
declared medically

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:10%
dead a little over
three minutes,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:10%
which I should never come back.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if should-- if I did,
-That's a long time.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:90%
 --have major-- It is.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
--have major brain
damage, and everything.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, anybody that
knows I'm a medical intuitive

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.687 align:middle line:84%
might think there's brain
damage, but, oh well.

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Until they get used to you.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.953 align:middle line:84%
 That's another--
that's another story.

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Another whole thing.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But what it did is,
it changed my sight.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Literally altered
my eyes to the point

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
where they let in
too much light.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.917 align:middle line:84%
That's about the
best we can say.

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
you couldn't see,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't as though
everything was dark.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Was everything too
blown out with light?

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It was too blown
out with light.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It was white light.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I could hear-- When somebody
would say something that

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.067 align:middle line:84%
had kind of an edge to it, at
I don't really know what that

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
really meant at the time,
but it felt like there was

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
an edge, or a little bit
of frustration, and anger,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I would see light
shoot in front of me.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, wow, this
is really kind of weird.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, when--
as it passed, and I

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
got back, trying to live with
it, the lights never went away.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:10%
So anything that has
atoms, and molecules,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:10%
and motion, trees, plants,
humans, even water in movement,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:10%
all has an aura.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I get to see.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Even what appear to
be inanimate objects,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.065 align:middle line:84%
such as coming into a
beautiful building like this.

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, at-- exactly.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And crystals, I mean, coming
in to the building of Gaiam,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and to see the crystals,
and to see how open they

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
are, and the colors
they are, and I mean,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
it's like they reach out and
just welcome you, and so forth.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
anything about it.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, honestly,
Regina, I didn't even

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
know how to spell aura.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.211 align:middle line:84%
 --as real as this-- this--
you slammed into this reality--

00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
 --along with slamming
into your body.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I here I am, in
the corporate world,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking, oh my
gosh, this needs go away.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I've got a big corporate
account that I'm going to.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:10%
What if they can see--
know that I see auras?

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:90%
How is this going-- it-- the--

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
What happened when--
was it like Mel Gibson,

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, "What Women
Want", when he could hear

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
everything that
women were thinking,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't very flattering.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.994 align:middle line:90%
But was it like that?

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you-- What happened when
you went to your next meeting?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I went into this meeting.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I had 168 managers, and-- and
interesting, the funny, kind

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic humor of
things, as I'm learning,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is that this was an
organization that I

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
was invited to do personality
work in the research

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and development.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But when I looked
at the colors, there

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a lot of research and
development mentality there.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like, take something
and maybe make it better,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
but nothing really cutting edge.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out at
them, and I thought,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, Carol, you
are really in trouble.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to interact?

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, is it going
to get in the way?

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:10%
Is it going to impede
you being able to share?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a tremendous
amount of anxiety and fear

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:90%
came around it.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And when it was done,
I was very relieved.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they measured
whether you're going to come

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
back on the evaluations.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And I got good evaluations.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
So then I was really relieved.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, you know, I've
got to figure out what this is.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you're saying you
were looking at the people,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
you were seeing the spectrum
of colors within their aura,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing those
were not the colors

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.441 align:middle line:84%
that supported the very
mission this company had.

00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
They were the wrong
people plugged in.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one way in
which you see people, and also

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
assist people with
your consultation,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is that you can see
when they're doing

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:84%
something totally out-of-sync
with their own energetic

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:90%
matrix.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the-- and the thing with
the-- unlike the human mind

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that can rationalize,
the energetic field

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:90%
is just pure truth.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
When someone is really
left-brain oriented,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying
to force themselves

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
into a right-brain creativity,
they can do that, if they do it

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with themselves.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But if they try to be something
other than who they are,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
it creates stress.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
see in the field.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well we're going to
talk about that, at length,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.559 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Because most people are trying
to be something they're not.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
On one level or another, this
just is endemic to the species.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Certainly to the Western
way of life, I think.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.635 align:middle line:84%
But going back to this,
so you-- I remember you

00:13:38.635 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
had told me before
that you were actually

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
praying to get rid of this
vision that you were having.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:90%
This-- this type of sight.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Please let me wake up
and be normal, right?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reason--
as it progressed,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I still hung on to the words
of the doctor, that this

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:90%
too will pass, and it didn't.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And it evolved.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I would be able
to see things that I

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%
just couldn't understand.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And there was no books.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there-- there really
weren't-- wasn't the field

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of medical intuition.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So you would go, and I
would read about chakras,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and I would read about
aura, and I would

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:90%
try to read all about this.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But the thing with the intuition
is that, once you embrace it,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
it just opens up the
way that it's designed.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And it just was a--
constantly evolving.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
At that time,
there weren't even

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
many books on the
color of subj--

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:84%
of-- of-- the subject of
color therapy, where you could

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
even see what colors meant.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
had to intuit your way

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.149 align:middle line:84%
through this understanding--
-I did.

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
 --large extent.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if I
would-- a friend of mine

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
said, well, Carol--
and please keep

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
in mind I'm a scientist,
and very, kind of,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:90%
in that left-brain world.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And a friend said
to me, well, Carol,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
the only way you're
going to learn about this

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:90%
is to go to a psychic fair.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well I don't know
how you're going to do this.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well I'm
going to go, come with me.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, sit down
and start talking to people.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started
seeking out anybody.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I would go up to people and--
at the tables-- and I'd say,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:90%
do you see auras?

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:90%
And they'd go, no.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you see auras?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And finally I ran into one
lady, and she said she did,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, well
what do you see?

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:90%
And then she would share.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, do you see red?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you see gray?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you see teal?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you see this?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, no,
I don't see that.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.851 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I went
in, is that bad?

00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it good?
What does it mean?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And so we'd just dialect.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I had to learn.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And it took you a lot of years
to begin piecing together,

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
kind of, over-arching
patterns, and colors,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.641 align:middle line:84%
and movements of colors,
and forms, didn't it?

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean--
-It did.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.126 align:middle line:84%
How many-- how long did it
take you to put it together?

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really-- before I
actually became comfortable,

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning that I was comfortable
with the education I had,

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
because I went in, not only
wanted to know about auras

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and energy, I wanted to
know about the anatomy

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:90%
and physiology of the body.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what organs, glands,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
did, how were they connected?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Illness, what kind of illnesses?

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
How is it connected?

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.261 align:middle line:84%
My world of personality,
how was it connected?

00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
So it did.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
It took me about 16
years of trial and error,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
education, to get here.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:10%
And at that point
in time, each time,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:10%
again, you would think that
you would have an answer,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:10%
something would unfold.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is, I
started creating binders.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I would ask people if they
wanted their aura read?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I would create
binders of pictures

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that I-- here I am, 30--
well, about that time

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
it was about 43 when it
started-- I was coloring.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.675 align:middle line:84%
I was walking around
with crayon boxes.

00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES] 120
crayons were my best friend.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And you were coloring what
you were seeing in people?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:90%
What I was seeing in people.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd get
their permission,

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
because I learned
very early on that,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, while this
was kind of fun,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, you'd be
standing in a grocery line,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and you'd say to someone, oh,
you have very beautiful colors.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.577 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'd move their
cart to another aisle.

00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like, well, don't do that.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.284 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd be in the
produce department,

00:17:03.284 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
they're squeezing
away, and I'd see

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.983 align:middle line:84%
all these red, and this
anger, and this stuff,

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, oh, well
you don't have to squeeze

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%
that-- don't say that Carol.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
But what I did is,
I literally started,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:90%
what does diabetes look like?

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:90%
What is the pattern of diabetes?

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:90%
What are the colors?

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Where does it show
up in the aura?

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Immune system disorders,
thyroid disorders, and I

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:90%
created a binder of what I saw.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
would find someone

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
with the same type of illness,
I would find the same pattern.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was-- it
was pretty consistent.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Even though we are very
different, our conditioning is

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
different, what we expect
of our self is different,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of illness
is very consistent.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And once I understood
what the pattern was,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and the way the other
parts of the body

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
were impacted by it, and--
for example, with diabetes.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes really, in many
cases, are tied to thyroid.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So when I would see
someone with diabetes,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I would have thyroid
issues, maybe hypoglycemia,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I would have
Hashimoto's, or a low thyroid.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I would also
find with diabetes,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
the liver would be involved.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And then-- so, I started
seeing these connections.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And what ultimately
led to the work

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that I do-- and I
work with doctors.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm not, anti-medicine,
anti-doctor--

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:10%
is that doctors treat symptoms.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the way they're--
that's the way they're taught.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
They're-- they're not trying to
do anything to us, it's taught.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
But for me, for a headache,
it doesn't start your head.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It starts in your stomach.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I know two people, where they
say, I'm getting a migraine.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:90%
My stomach's very upset.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And we even now call
them, stomach migraines,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:90%
so there you go.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
started looking at that,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get MRIs and
all the different things.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor will come back,
which is absolutely accurate,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
wrong in the head.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Well there isn't.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
OK so now, you-- you
have your binder together,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and once you started
finding these connections,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and you created, I assume,
a big, fat binder, now

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
did you do-- is
that at the point

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you decided to do
this as a career?

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.259 align:middle line:84%
I did.
I did.

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized-- and
I even was having doctors

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
come to me, because they were
hearing about what I was doing,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and how was working, and
they would come to me.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And the gift of a
medical intuitive-- and I

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:84%
hate to put all of us
in one, kind of, bag,

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to do that
for the sake of this--

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:90%
we see the big picture.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I liken us to a radiologist.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:10%
Instead of seeing one
part that isn't working

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:10%
or malfunctioning, we
see all the other parts

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:10%
that are involved.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:10%
And if we can offer a doctor,
or we can offer person,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:10%
a bigger picture, then the
person can focus on the area

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:10%
that they feel they have
a sense of control over.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, now they
engage and participate

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
in their own healing.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what healing is.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Healing is, it's having
people to help you,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
but you doing your own
healing at the same time.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So it was just-- that's
how it came about.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:10%
So now I'm just
going to ask, kind

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:10%
of, an open question before
we get into some specifics.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Are most people, when they're
given the truth of what it is,

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
including its origin, because
a lot of this a spiritual,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and emotional even, once they
are given a reflection back

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
of what's actually
going on, are most

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
people capable of initiating
their own healing process?

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
That-- I think that's a real
hopeful part of what I do,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:90%
and other medical intuitives do.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
People have a difficult
time healing the body

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
if they really don't
understand what the dynamics.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
If they could a
picture of what it is--

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.917 align:middle line:84%
and that again, like you said,
Regina, the gift of the aura

00:21:03.917 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
is, it just doesn't reveal
what's going on in the body.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It reveals emotions, it reveals
core themes, thought patterns,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
it read-- it just tells the
whole life story of the person.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you can say to someone,
for example, with diabetes,

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is that diabetes,
metaphorically, is

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:90%
the loss of sweetness of life.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
That means that there's
an element of sadness.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can say to someone,
look at the parts of your life

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
where you experience
this sadness,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.887 align:middle line:84%
and what can you do to feel
like you have control over it?

00:21:38.887 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
That you can make a difference.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Why is it-- and why
is it an epidemic now,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't 40 years ago?

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I think
you've touched

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
on it, from the standpoint, I
think that we've grown into,

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
kind of a-- a group
consciousness,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
that we have to somehow fit.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
That marching to the own
drum-- your own drummer

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:90%
isn't an accepted thing.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
We have such a need to be liked,
or to be loved, or to fit in,

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that I think that we
just are conditioned

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:90%
to basically lose the essence.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
We really don't
lose the essence,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
but lose connection
with that essence.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:15.831 align:middle line:84%
-Awareness--
-Absolutely.

00:22:15.831 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
- --of that.
-Absolutely.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And diabetes is an
awareness disease.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
It's getting back in
touch with yourself,

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and becoming aware of what
brings those little things-- it

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to
be the big thing--

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
those little things that
bring you happiness,

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
or that make you smile,
or that bring you joy.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
What's it-- Can you tell
us what it looks like?

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about, someone
walks through the door,

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and they have
diabetes, to the extent

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
where they really need to be
injecting themselves daily.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
An adult-- not adult, but maybe
even, early onset diabetes.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, what does that
look like within the body,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and then within this
etheric portion of it,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.300 align:middle line:90%
as well, energetically?

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The parts that are obviously
activated, duller, or whatever.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it-- and again,
excuse me for jumping there,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
but the beauty of the aura is,
is that when somebody walks in,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
it may not be that the first
thing that's revealed to me

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:90%
is a pattern of diabetes.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:10%
It may very well be that
it's tied into the fact

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:10%
that they're not feeling--
maybe they're feeling helpless.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're feeling
hopeless, maybe there's

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
some sadness about them, maybe
they're feeling like they're

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
lost, and so forth.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
That may be one
person will say that,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and then that's my cue to go
in deeper and look at the body.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Other people may walk in,
and it's like, oh my gosh,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
this is type 2 diabetes.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It's in the advanced stages.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We need to work with it.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that will look
like in the pancreas area,

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:90%
it will have, first, a brown.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the outer layer, letting
me know there's congestion.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Brown, OK.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It's letting me know
that there's congestion

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
in the field, their body isn't
assimilating food the way

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:90%
that it needs to.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Then what I'll do is, I'll find
the layer underneath that, that

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:90%
kind of protrudes out, is red.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That lets me know that
their energy-burning part

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:90%
of their bodies is struggling.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
They're just like,
the mitochondria,

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the energy-burning part
of the cell is struggling.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
fighting for survival,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and doing their thing.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I may find
a phlegm green,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:84%
in my world, that's basically
where we've got insulin,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
we've got a sluggishness,
we've got a thyroid

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:84%
not talking to the liver,
not talking to the pancreas,

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
not talking to the liver,
not talking to the thyroid.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So again, it just--
it just maps it.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And what would those same
areas look like if they

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:90%
were in a healthy state?

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Well in a healthy state,
first thing I might do

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is, I might see red
if they're stressed.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And that usually,
to me, is it's like,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:84%
well probably, if you had
that big, giant Double Mac

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:84%
hamburger, or hamburger, there
probably isn't an alignment

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
with the digestive system.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So I might see the
color red, but it would

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:90%
be a much different meaning.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So the pancreas would normally
be what, energetically?

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, the color of it
is kind of, the best way to say

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
is, kind of, maybe
like a terracotta,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:90%
a peach, an apricot.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when it goes into this
deep brown, red-y color--

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
When it goes into this red
color, in this phlegm green,

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
as I call it, and everything,
it just lets me know.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just not functioning
the way it's designed to.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And when it's functioning
the way it's designed to,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I get this little terracotta,
peach bumpling out

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And behaviorally, a person
is much more engaged.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:90%
They're very enthusiastic.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they have a sense
of control over their life.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's just a different
persona about them.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, do you kind
of back engineer it,

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
where you see the auric
issue first, and then start

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
asking questions,
and then you start

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
getting the emotional or
spiritual components to it?

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you can find
your way with your client?

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And the beauty of the aura
is that, as I tell people,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:10%
you completely control me.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have a place where
you aren't willing to go,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I can't go there with you.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:10%
If there's something
that they're dealing

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:10%
with on an emotional level
that may have a lot of history

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:10%
to it, and they're
not ready to hear it,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:10%
it's not going to
reveal itself to me.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But you do, you just go
in and-- and in a case of,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
if I see something in the
aura, such as diabetes,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and I know that if it's
in the beginning stages,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:84%
or it's advanced, I
will say to someone,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:90%
are you working with a doctor?

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.051 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they'll
say yes or no.

00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you're working
with a doctor,

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:90%
have you been diagnosed?

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.141 align:middle line:84%
And if they've been diagnosed,
then I take it from there.

00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start
helping them rebuild,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
really with some things we were
talking about in the beginning,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
starting to look at their
own fears, number one.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Then start looking
at some of the values

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that they may have
gone astray on.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And you really start
rebuilding, psychologically

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally,
forward, don't you?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
You really do.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I mean,
we-- I think we get

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:90%
lost so we can find our self.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think the gift of illness,
as strange as it may sound,

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is that it's a great equalizer.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was in our day
timer, our agenda was too full,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.050 align:middle line:84%
everything we had to do, when
you suddenly don't wake up,

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and you don't feel well,
or you've been diagnosed,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:90%
nothing is important but you.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
You, your body, your life,
you look at your life,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:90%
you look at your job.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Are you really happy?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Are you not?

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's a
time of awareness.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
It really is an awakening
and awareness time.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be-- we take
a break in just a minute here,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
but when we come back, we're
going to be talking about some

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of the other larger issues
that you're starting to see.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
autoimmune disorders.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, is this an-- this
is of epidemic proportions now.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It is, absolutely.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Even more so than diabetes.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that, we're
going to also be taking a look

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
at some of the new kids that
are coming into the world,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:84%
because the little kids
that-- many of you see them,

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
they have a different kind
of shine in their eyes.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.405 align:middle line:84%
They know things that you
didn't know at that same age,

00:27:57.405 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and you would say, this is a
very different type of child.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to tell
us what they look like,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and what they're bringing
to the planet at this time.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.250 align:middle line:90%
So stay tuned.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.202 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:10.202 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're back with medical
intuitive, Carol Ritberger.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I-- it's a fascinating
conversation to this point,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much
more we have to discuss.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I already
teased it coming in,

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk a little bit
about autoimmune problems

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:84%
in the public at
large, because we're

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:90%
having-- we're struggling.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
struggling, at all ages,

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:90%
are struggling with autoimmune.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And you have a unique
perspective on what this means.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I-- and thank you for
that, because it really is.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of the focus,
from the medical aspect of it,

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:90%
is on diabetes.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I've
seen as a medical intuitive is

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
our immune systems are
constantly being taxed.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're looking
at the stress,

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the foods,
no matter-- our core values,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it-- we're just almost
pushed the limits.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And our immune
system's our protector,

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and it really doesn't know
how to protect us from us.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, when we get
into these cycles of thoughts

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that really don't
reflect who we are,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
the brain goes in
and says, come on.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Immune system, help me do this.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Help me figure this out.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I need to solve this problem.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And what it'll do
is, it'll go in

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and it'll actually
trigger inflammation.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:10%
And I guess if we said that
autoimmune is at an epidemic

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:10%
level, I think we even have
to go down deeper than that,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:10%
and say that, really,
inflammation is an epidemic.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.449 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Absolutely.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's at the base
of all chronic disease.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:10%
All chronic disease,
or all heart disease,

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:53.770 align:middle line:10%
or high cholesterol, or all
of the different things that

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:10%
are going on.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even going
into fibromyalgia,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
going into chronic fatigue,
going into aches and pains,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:84%
an idiopathic pain that
kind of bounces around

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:90%
in its referral and everything.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:84%
All of it comes back
down to inflammation.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
As a medical
intuitive, inflammation

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:90%
is really clear to me.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:90%
We're irritated with ourselves.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And that could be, we're
disappointed at ourselves,

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:10%
maybe unrealistic
expectations, there's

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:10%
a whole lot of psyc-- there's
a lot of psychological things

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:10%
that contribute to it.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:10%
But until we can get to
that root cause of why we're

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:10%
irritated with ourselves,
individually, it just wrecks

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:10%
havoc on the physical body.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, and then what
happens when you add to that

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the
medical industry is not

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:84%
really trained to look
at things, certainly,

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:90%
the way you are right.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, you throw a pill at
it, or a lot of pills at it.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Well and I think the
pills certainly address

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the issue that was
basically identified,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but the human body doesn't
know what to do with everything

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
we're throwing at it.
-Right

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean we-- you know, our--

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.731 align:middle line:84%
Especially one-size-fits-all
types of drugs.

00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm
not anti-medicine,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
but so many of the
things that we're taking

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:84%
are really inflammatory
in their reaction.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics, we're changing
the whole way we're looking

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:90%
at the use of antibiotics.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:84%
That-- it used to be that,
anything that was wrong,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:90%
let's throw antibiotics at it.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we're realizing the body
is adapting to antibiotics,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
it creates a tremendous
inflammatory reaction,

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:84%
it's helping the immune
system, but it's also

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:90%
creating a myriad of problems.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
It's changing the gut and
the way it works, and pH,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and it goes on, and on, and on.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're seeing that
we're not throwing that at it

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:90%
way that we used to.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But again, for me as
a medical intuitive,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
it's like stepping back and
just saying to ourselves, very

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
simply, using our
body energy, using

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:84%
where we are psychologically,
if we're angry,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I know we're not born angry.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Anger is a conditioned response.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
If we're angry about
something, the way I look at it

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is, the soul is
basically saying,

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.414 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to be here.

00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be here.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a place
that's good for you.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It isn't a place that's
healthy for you, meaning body,

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:90%
psychologically.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.471 align:middle line:84%
And if we looked at anger as
just that barometer that says,

00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:18.860 align:middle line:84%
stop.
Take a deep breath.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Step back.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Is this where you want to be?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Is this compromising you?

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Is this causing you to be
irritated with yourself?

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But people are living in low
and high levels of this state,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.350 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional
level, chronically.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we're frustrated
with the world about us.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:84%
We're frustrated with--
well, and for good reason,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
with many things right now, life
is offering lot of challenges,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because we're in these
deeply changing times.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And the frustration--
I mean, again,

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:84%
if-- as a medical
intuitive, I mean

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to be able to do this
with other people, sometimes

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I fall into my own
abyss, honestly, with it.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:10%
But the reality of it is,
frustration is the emotion

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:10%
that is a precursor to anger.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.990 align:middle line:10%
So if we were to just
say, I'm frustrated,

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:10%
and acknowledge
it, acknowledging

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.590 align:middle line:10%
it changes the chemistry
of the body and the way

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:10%
the brain accepts it.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:10%
It removes that fear.
-OK.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we
don't intercept it?

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the beautiful
thing about having mastery

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
over the emotions, of
the mind, meditation,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:90%
any number of practices.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But let's say it got past us
before we were able to put

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
those good filters up, and we're
going into fear over something.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Anger and fear.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it from a
biochemical point of view,

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:90%
what happens in the body?

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Well the--

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And what it looks
like in the aura, too.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
is, anatomically,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
when we experience
fear, it literally

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:84%
sends off an
electrochemical, kind

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:90%
of an avalanche of messages.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary
gland, that's master

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
gland of the endocrine
system, reads emotions.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:84%
That pituitary gland isn't
coming in and saying, from,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll use the example of
a snake, we see a snake,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and the snake is a snake.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But our history is,
oh, snakes are bad.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So what the pituitary
reads is, this is bad.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.719 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have a
filter in it that basically

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:90%
discerns how bad it is.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So a snake, it's bad,
the pituitary goes,

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:90%
this is life-threatening bad.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a
result, that changes

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:90%
the chemistry the adrenals.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we have adrenaline,
corticosteroids, cortisol

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:90%
running through the body.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Breathing changes, heart rate
changes, perspiration changes,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.491 align:middle line:84%
digestion changes, and we are
in a full-blown fight or flight,

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
over--
-And this is happening all day.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:90%
All day.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.310 align:middle line:84%
All day, even in places
that we're not aware of it.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're aware
if there's a snake,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and we have a fear of snakes.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But it can be something as
simple as, getting an email.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is, it--
it-- the brain adapts.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're learning
in all of the new field

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:90%
of neuroscience.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
The brain adapts
very quickly to fear.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It accepts it as being
the norm, if we experience

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:90%
it in a consecutive manner.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, what happens is that
you may get an email that

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
may be very innocuous,
but for some reason

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:90%
it triggered an emotion in you.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.795 align:middle line:84%
That brain is going to
send that same reaction,

00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and it speaks to
the immune system,

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that the immune system
says, we've got a problem.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's go out and burn it out.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.161 align:middle line:84%
Let's find it out,
ferret it out.

00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is--
-Bring the fire hoses and--

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's create inflammation.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And the gift of the
inflammation is, fever is one

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
of the forms of inflammation.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to burn it out.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to get
it to the surface.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- but we're
literally have been--

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:84%
excuse me for one-size-fits-all,
but we're literally have been

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:84%
so fear-based consciousness,
that our brains have adapted

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:90%
to fears being the norm.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And if an emotion around
a snake creates anger,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:84%
because the snake's there,
or an email creates anger,

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the brain doesn't
discern the difference.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.045 align:middle line:84%
It creates the same
chemical reaction.

00:36:07.045 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about it
from your type of vision.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.230 align:middle line:84%
What does that look like
when something has-- say

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
you had this email
and your brain is

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
now interpreting it in a
fearful, threatened manner.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.060 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing
within the person?

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is,
is that it's like

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:90%
out of the solar plexus area.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like this big,
gaping hole opens up.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's just all
this red energy

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:90%
just pouring out of them.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
In that case, it's kind of
like their life force is just

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
being sucked out
of them, and that's

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:90%
what it looks like to me.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is, it dissipates out,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's like it leaves us
energetically vulnerable.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we're vulnerable
to the energy coming

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in that supports the fear.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
brain is out there going,

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is there anything out there
that supports this fear?

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We're like magnets,
and we pull it in.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.627 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we call up a friend and
go, I just got this email.

00:37:00.627 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And the friend
goes, I don't know.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:10%
I got an email like
that the other day.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Now you're freaking
each other out.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Now we're--

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.330 align:middle line:90%
So this is very depleting.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely it is.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And it drains us of
energy, and then we

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:84%
wonder why we're so tired,
why we have sleep issues,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:90%
insomnia, sleep deprivation.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body
just doesn't relax.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And why we have very little
passion and enthusiasm.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's-- honestly,
and when I see this,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
it's like we just
get up in the morning

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:90%
and we go through the motions.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it gets
us through the day.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it pays the bills.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we get a sense
of satisfaction,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little bit,
at the end of the day.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's now what we're--
came into this life to do.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.461 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we came
into life to learn,

00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and that means you're going
to learn what you don't like,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
learn what you like.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't come into this
world to let everything--

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:90%
To be drones.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.650 align:middle line:84%
To be drones, or to feel
like, you know, we have -- this

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:90%
cord that's out, it's like, OK.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.915 align:middle line:84%
Anybody need energy?
Plug me in.

00:38:02.915 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Plug me in.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Suck me dry.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and so, this is a
really lovely segue now into

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
the newer people on the planet.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
The ones who are shorter
and not quite as old.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Because this period
of time is giving

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.270 align:middle line:90%
birth to a new type of being.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:90%
It really, it is.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:10%
The-- in many of the
ancient texts, and there's

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:10%
a whole bunch of them,
so I could quote them,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:10%
but they were called
blue children.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were called blue
children because, oracally,

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:90%
the blue is about truth.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:90%
It's about speaking your truth.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It's tied to that individual
will-power, and kind

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:90%
of the essence of who we are.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they were referred
to as blue children.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And we really started becoming
aware of them, scientifically,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in 1981.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And we called them the indigos.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And these are highly
developed, highly

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:84%
developed in their intuition,
highly intuitive children that

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
don't see things, or
do things-- I mean,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
there was a young boy
in China that could

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:84%
read a book through his toes.
-Yes.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And another one,
I saw, that could

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.801 align:middle line:84%
put it under their pillow,
or under their arm.

00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They-- they see
things differently.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They work differently.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They're also
anatomically different.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.360 align:middle line:84%
We are knowing--
we-- the science

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that's been around it is,
we know their livers are

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:90%
actually different.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They have more of a filter
system than our livers do.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.340 align:middle line:90%
That's advantageous.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
a different way

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.450 align:middle line:90%
that their immune systems work.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, they could
transmute AIDS or cancer,

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and they could die
of a common cold.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing some
things that are happening.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
But they're here--
I really believe

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:84%
they're here to help us, again,
remember what's important.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:84%
That truth, that
importance of what life is.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And they call it like it is,
and they don't have any problem

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:90%
getting in your face.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, you're
not speaking the truth.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Now is this for a
generation at large.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Are you speaking of very
specific individuals?

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Because, a lot of times,
we'll see in a family,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll hear many people say,
oh, my little grandchild

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:90%
is very different.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:90%
You can see in their eyes.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And proud grandparents.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And they are, usually, these
little kids are really quite,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.875 align:middle line:90%
quite advanced for their years.

00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Their understanding,
and comprehending

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.780 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around them,
and articulating it back.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But our-- is it true, also,
that other children that may not

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
appear to have this kind
of indigo-child nature,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:90%
may actually be just as lit up.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just that,
maybe they're not

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
in an environment that
encourages the sharing as much

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:90%
as another household might.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
bringing that up.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.380 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And they may not be as lit
up, but that doesn't mean

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.540 align:middle line:90%
they're not doing their work.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
The indigos tend
to-- the children

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.270 align:middle line:84%
tend to gravitate to
parents that maybe

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.240 align:middle line:84%
aren't as truthful
with each other,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:90%
or are struggling with truth.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they-- they
really-- they're

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.600 align:middle line:90%
here to just change everything.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.020 align:middle line:10%
And I used to do a lot
of work with teaching

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:10%
people about indigo children,
and frankly, I stopped it.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped it
because it started

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to create this differentiation,
well my child's

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:84%
better than yours, or my child's
a crystal, or my child is this,

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:90%
or my child is that.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And the children, when
I would talk to them,

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.610 align:middle line:84%
they got so
frustrated with this.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would come to me
and they would say, Carol,

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:90%
this isn't what this is about.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, I know.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.980 align:middle line:90%
But this is what we do.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We're so conditioned to
categorize, and to create

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:84%
pecking orders, and
this kind of, somebody's

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.230 align:middle line:90%
more intuitive than the other.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.610 align:middle line:84%
That's-- they are here to
remind us what's important,

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and to teach us to speak
truth, and to teach

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:90%
us how to truly love.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.781 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
message of this era.

00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has been for the
last few thousand years,

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.951 align:middle line:84%
but I mean, now we have
to kind of get it down.

00:42:01.951 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And they call us
on it, don't they?

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.401 align:middle line:84%
It's time to not just talk it,
but to walk it, so to speak.

00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.994 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking off
camera, and another thing,

00:42:11.994 --> 00:42:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and I bring this up for
purpose, because I'm

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
going back to where we are
right now in the conversation.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at individuals,

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and there are certain
propensities for a,

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:84%
say a personality trait, or
even a physical disorder,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.890 align:middle line:84%
even physical
markings on the body,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
such as in Paul Von
Ward's work, and what

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:84%
they're doing with reincarnation
and the human genome.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about past lives,
past experiences, that appear

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:90%
to be flowing into the present.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, is that these
kids remember their past lives.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, they-- I mean, I've
had two-year-olds that could--

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that would say to their
mother, do you remember

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:90%
when I was your mother?

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And the mother's like, oh, OK.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, this would be fine.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:56.520 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:84%
They-- they don't have
that veil that we do,

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that separates the
past, past lives,

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.330 align:middle line:84%
the present, and the future.
-Right.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And so they will.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They-- and-- past
lives is when you

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:90%
bring that information forward.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Something that I learned when
I was in the transition time,

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
all we do-- and we're
not bringing bad karma.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We're just bringing
back what we learned--

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Just experience.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
 --to be able to share,
to refine our self,

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to share with others.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:26.496 align:middle line:84%
-To tweak a little bit.
-To tweak.

00:43:26.496 --> 00:43:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what it is.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.049 align:middle line:84%
-It's all about tweaking.
-It is.

00:43:29.049 --> 00:43:30.035 align:middle line:90%
It's all about reinventing.

00:43:30.035 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to recreate
all the time, but reinvent.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I had that
experience with my son,

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
when he was about three
years, eight, nine months old.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
He was a little guy,
and I was just feeling

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:90%
blue this particular day.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And the two of us
were at home, and he

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:90%
was building a pillow fort.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:84%
He loved building--
building pillow forts.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:52.723 align:middle line:84%
So he's a little
sandy-haired guy,

00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's building
his pillow fort.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I being-- I
wasn't very much fun,

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of lost
in my own little world.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, honey-- And I was
referring to a past life

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:84%
thing, when I was speaking with
him, so I'll say that upfront.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Something that I knew
about from the past.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, honey,
I just want you

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to know that, even
though I'm not

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:84%
very much fun to be with
sometimes, I love you dearly.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
I didn't treat you

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
as well as I could
have, and I don't

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.540 align:middle line:90%
ever want that to happen again.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept
building his pillow fort.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And the he said,
it's all right, Mom.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I did it to you, too.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting to get
anything back on this one.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to-- I
just had to say it.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh no, I did it
to you when I was your daddy.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.850 align:middle line:90%
He said, well--

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, when did you see this?

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, I was supposed to
be taking a nap at Busy Bee--

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.000 align:middle line:84%
his nursery school-- And he
said, I couldn't go to sleep,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
seeing this stuff.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.484 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well where were we?

00:44:49.484 --> 00:44:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, it was
at a place called England.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.470 align:middle line:84%
He had adenoids, and he
was always stuffed up.

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was in a
place called England.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And he told me what
the buildings look like

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and everything, which
was not anything

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:90%
that he was exposed to.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't know these things.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.020 align:middle line:84%
He was not that kind
of kid at that time.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And then started telling
me what he was wearing,

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you were the oldest
child, and the mommy died.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And there were a bunch of
kids, and I used to beat you up

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.980 align:middle line:90%
because I was angry and sad.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, whoa.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until many, many years
later, when he was an adult,

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and he said, oh,
I remember that.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was a
boy for some reason,

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out that
I was his daughter,

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:90%
but I reminded him of his wife.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was so angry and sad
at being left with this brood

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.120 align:middle line:90%
of kids, because she had died.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, oh my
god, chicken and egg.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Where does this
stuff begin, right?

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But he was very
comfortable, and he's also

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:84%
at the age that was at
the very beginning of what

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.390 align:middle line:84%
was called the influx
of that particular kind

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Not a different being
from another place.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Which brings me now to
where I wanted to go.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.050 align:middle line:84%
These little kids, and this
memory they're bringing forth,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is really just showing
us our future selves,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because we'll be,
theoretically, coming

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.520 align:middle line:84%
right back into that
wheel of life as them.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's part of
the process of the way they

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:90%
bring the information forward.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.730 align:middle line:84%
They're very expansive
in their thinking.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They're neurology is
phenomenal, with the way

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.540 align:middle line:90%
the nerve synapses are wired.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.751 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they literally are
bouncing around their brain

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We may think, as
parents, my gosh,

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:90%
they're bouncing all around.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But they literally
are bouncing around.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:84%
They-- they don't-- they don't
have that conditioning that,

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.790 align:middle line:84%
you have to be this,
or you have to be that.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.200 align:middle line:90%
They just flow beautifully.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.291 align:middle line:84%
And their auras are more open
when you're looking at them?

00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:38.990 align:middle line:90%
 They are.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, I liken
that-- and thank you

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.590 align:middle line:84%
for asking that, too, because I
liken the aura of the children,

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and when I say children, we have
elder indigos that are gracing

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.440 align:middle line:84%
this earth, as well, that are
kind of the eyes and ears,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and when they can't
find their answers,

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
they can go to Gaiam
TV, or they can

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:90%
go somewhere else to find it.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is with
them, their energy is

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.430 align:middle line:90%
a lot like an animal or a tree.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't see an animal
coming in and going,

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, I'm going
to put my barrier,

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to let anybody in.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.355 align:middle line:90%
Or tree doesn't do that.

00:47:08.355 --> 00:47:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, well, you're
a bad tree over here.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to protect myself.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Their energy is very open, and
they know you before they even

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:90%
connect with you.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Their auras are--
we've actually measure

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.100 align:middle line:90%
their auras 55 feet from them.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.180 align:middle line:84%
We have instrumentation
that we can do this.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like an animal.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The animals out there, they
get to know you before they

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.410 align:middle line:84%
even get to talk to you.
-Right.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.465 align:middle line:84%
They've already
sensed your field

00:47:30.465 --> 00:47:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and brought back
the information.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And they've already sensed you.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.180 align:middle line:84%
They know whether you
can learn from them,

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.540 align:middle line:90%
they can learn from you.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.610 align:middle line:84%
If it's just a smile, you've
learned something from them.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.560 align:middle line:84%
If they stop and talk to you, or
if they need something, and may

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.840 align:middle line:90%
be guidance, they'll do it.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You'll say to them, oh
isn't this a lovely day?

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Or something, or just help them.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They're very open.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:90%
They're very healing.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
connected to each other.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're coming
back into this era of,

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:90%
love thy neighbor as thyself.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And-- and also, an era where
we're supposed to be looking

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.560 align:middle line:84%
at the reasons for this
conditioning of judging

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.040 align:middle line:90%
one another so harshly.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Really, the new era
is about compassion,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're all on
that learning curve.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
learn in our own way.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But what is the difference
with these kids, in the way

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:90%
to connect with each other?

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we just see
it and think, jeez,

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
can they ever get off
the iPhone, BlackBerry?

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.290 align:middle line:84%
They're addicted to the
technology, but you're saying,

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.330 align:middle line:84%
no, it's not the technology
they're addicted to.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I really don't
believe that they are.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's a
new form of community.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, they're
much more community-oriented

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:84%
than someone of my age that,
we think we're community

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
because we talk to our
neighbor, but we really

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.620 align:middle line:90%
aren't community-oriented.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:49.620 align:middle line:84%
We become kind of isolated in
the way that we live our life.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.470 align:middle line:84%
We go to work, we
have our cubicles,

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:84%
we work within our cubicles,
we go home, we close our doors.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Close-- so we really aren't, but
these kids, this social media

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about,
and psychologists

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:84%
are talking about-- a lot about
all the negative aspect of it.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.360 align:middle line:90%
The reality is, it isn't.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that it's negative.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it in their field.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there's always
anomalies, I need to say that.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.390 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be much
more open with each other,

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and you more, warts and all.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.350 align:middle line:90%
If you don't like it, too bad.

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.183 align:middle line:90%
Which is very refreshing.

00:49:18.183 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:90%
They call it like it is.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They, you know, they communicate
at a much larger scale

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.580 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.900 align:middle line:90%
They share so openly.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, what they-- what they
have belongs to someone else.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.831 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have
it, they can do it.

00:49:33.831 --> 00:49:34.530 align:middle line:90%
They share.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:38.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I think that
anything that's different,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the old
ways have to go in

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and dissect it, and have
to pick up everything

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:90%
that's wrong with it.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.620 align:middle line:10%
But if they would
look at the kids,

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:10%
and they would look
at their sociability,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:10%
they would look
at their openness,

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:10%
they would look at
their deep caring

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:10%
they have for society,
and people, and earth,

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and all the things.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.760 align:middle line:10%
They're so oneness-oriented.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think social media is just
a great way for that to happen

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:90%
at the scale that it can.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it's interesting,
because a lot of parents

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.030 align:middle line:84%
they're-- as we talked
about, they're frustrated,

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.000 align:middle line:84%
because the kid seems
to be dialed out.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents feel
that their children are

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:90%
being very dismissive of them.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know, yeah.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.160 align:middle line:90%
OK OK.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, how-- what would
you say to those parents

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to help them, maybe,
embrace this a little more,

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.170 align:middle line:90%
or work with it a bit more?

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.623 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot-- most
parents go through this now.

00:50:32.623 --> 00:50:33.322 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:35.680 align:middle line:84%
What I would probably
do is say to them,

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.180 align:middle line:84%
go back to when you
were 12 or 13 years old,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and you started differentiating
yourself from your mother

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and your father, and you
started into that, what we call,

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
puberty, which is the,
kind of, one-size-fits-all

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:90%
for behavioral issues.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.715 align:middle line:90%
But go back, where were you?

00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
You didn't want to
believe like your parents.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It-- it's an individual thing.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they're doing.

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's classically the same
thing that's always been.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they have
a device in their hands.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So--
-Absolutely.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to just get over
it and not personalize it.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But we had-- we had
devices in our hands, also.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:84%
We called them cars, we called
them this, we called them that.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was on the
telephone all the time.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, there it was.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Now it just happens where we're
not tethered down with it.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.519 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-But-- Yes.

00:51:12.519 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
What about the-- and now
what about the gender--

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.820 align:middle line:90%
the gender development?

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
really very different.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:90%
The girls are more assertive.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Even in-- and now,
in society, the women

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.540 align:middle line:84%
are starting-- the stats
have started changing.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Women are finding an easier time
of it, finding jobs right now,

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.780 align:middle line:90%
than the men are, for example.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But as we take it down
into younger age group,

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and say 30s and under,
you're talking about the boys

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.190 align:middle line:84%
seem to be more comfortable
with the feminine aspect

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.890 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The girls seem to
be more comfortable

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.170 align:middle line:90%
with their masculine aspect.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you see,
aurically, going on here?

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is
us in the future,

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:84%
let's observe, and
learn, and see from--

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that--
and you're right.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I see this a lot.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:52:00.900 align:middle line:10%
And I think the only way that,
kind of, the elders get a clue,

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:10%
is that they have to
see things different.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I do see a lot of the male
body taking feminine energy.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot more sensitivity,
a lot more compassion,

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think overall, that's for
us to stop the conditioning.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, that part that says,
you know, you're a boy, get

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.100 align:middle line:90%
up and do this, and everything.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the same
way for the girls.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're seeing that
the female is shifting, where

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.870 align:middle line:90%
she's bringing in that warrior.

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And that we're seeing,
just, a basic shift

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in the way that we're going
to condition and perceive

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:90%
masculine and feminine.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I think so, too.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I think it's
a beautiful thing,

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:43.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's difficult, as you go
out successive generations.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I notice even my
father's generation.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They have a very different view
of what my son's generation

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.540 align:middle line:84%
should be like, how
they should be behaving,

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and they should be more
aggressively pursuing.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:10%
But there are few
issues going on here.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.260 align:middle line:10%
They seem to take more
comfort in just being

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.250 align:middle line:10%
together, number one, socially.
-They do.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.310 align:middle line:84%
That seems to almost
have the top priority

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:04.620 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of levels.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, there aren't a
lot of jobs out there, which

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.970 align:middle line:84%
is creating a different issue,
which kids are not being--

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.450 align:middle line:84%
they're not having
the chance to really

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:15.570 align:middle line:84%
learn, and express themselves,
and take that responsibility.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:16.680 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.765 align:middle line:84%
Well for me, I think that
the only way we truly learn

00:53:19.765 --> 00:53:21.520 align:middle line:90%
is through contrast.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think, and my father's
very much the same way,

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.560 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint that,
this is what female does,

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is what male
does, and the roles

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:90%
are very well defined.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And when someone
doesn't follow that,

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.100 align:middle line:84%
then there's something
wrong with them,

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and probably something
wrong with parents.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And it just, kind of, mushrooms.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's an
opportunity for us to look back

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and to see that there is
a shift that's going on,

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that that shift is going to
be a very, very healthy shift.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And without the contrast, I
don't think that we learn.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
we're open to change.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I think we talk
about it, but I don't

00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:90%
think we're really open to it.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
this is the new way

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.490 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to be whole.

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Males are going to be
warriors when they need

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to, compassionate
when they need to,

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and females are
going to do the same.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going
to go back to that,

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.030 align:middle line:84%
almost, androgynous
approach to life,

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:17.061 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting, kind of,
boxed in with these gender

00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:84%
roles, personally.
That's my opinion.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

I think it's a progression,
if it does go that way.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Then we can start looking
more individually instead of,

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.560 align:middle line:84%
you're classified as a
male, so you're going to be

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.180 align:middle line:90%

auras, and, gosh, Regina,

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking about that,
so-- I would like to tell you

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that, when I look at young
people-- of course anybody

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.221 align:middle line:84%

-Yes.

I mean, really, I
appreciate you sharing that.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, I'm always
looking at the big picture,

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking, if they are
here to remind us of what we

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.200 align:middle line:84%
are, and what we are going
to become as a species,

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
then everything you're saying
is really, very good news.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know we only have
very few minutes left here,

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.517 align:middle line:84%
and there's one other thing
that you just briefly mentioned

00:56:07.517 --> 00:56:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to me off-camera, and
we haven't talked about,

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and that is, you had
an epiphany about pain.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I did.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:17.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just did this as
far as pain-- pain literally--

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:22.140 align:middle line:84%
we know, scientifically, if
the brain experiences pain, 60

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.890 align:middle line:84%
minutes, uninterrupted,
it actually

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:84%
changes cellular activity, and
it starts to normalize pain.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we, of course,
if we have surgery,

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.770 align:middle line:90%
it's an acute situation.

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Usually we'll go on drugs,
which is really, very helpful,

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.010 align:middle line:84%
because then the
brain doesn't go in

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and start adapting to the pain.

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we know is that
pain is associated with fear.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience the
pain, we experience the fear,

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:51.397 align:middle line:84%
we experience the anger--
-There you go.

00:56:51.397 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:84%
 --becasue we can't
do what we used to do.

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Now we're in that cycle.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Now we're back in that cycle.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're doing, from
the standpoint of looking

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:02.110 align:middle line:84%
at pain, is we're
looking at, what can we

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.700 align:middle line:84%
do, not so much from the
physiology of the body,

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or the anatomy, what can
we do, psychologically,

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to change the pattern?

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Crystals.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Magnets.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Stanford University is
using magnet therapy.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.400 align:middle line:84%
We're using crystal therapy,
music therapy, color therapy.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Things-- self talk, different
things, affirmations, mantras.

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.050 align:middle line:84%
All of them, though,
have one thing in common.

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:24.500 align:middle line:90%
They're all energetically-based.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They're all
energetically-based.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're all heartfelt-based.
-Heartfelt.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And they create balance and
harmony back into the body.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Well I hope that, in time, you
come back, after this research

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.980 align:middle line:90%
has gone a little deeper.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you're making
discoveries by the day,

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're able to
see what's going on.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that we
get to do this again,

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.760 align:middle line:90%
in the not-too-distant future.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really
appreciate your taking

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.510 align:middle line:90%
the time to be with us today.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I just love what you do,
and I love to beautiful way

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.970 align:middle line:90%
in which you see all of it.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for holding
that beauty for all of us.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280 align:middle line:84%
-Well, thank you.
-I really appreciate it.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.210 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:59.070 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I cannot think
of a more useful skill,

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:03.610 align:middle line:84%
regardless if anyone's
paying for it or not,

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and the nice thing is, you
teach people how to do this.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.100 align:middle line:84%
To be able to assist one
another with our vision

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.050 align:middle line:84%
is, probably, the
greatest gift in life.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.860 align:middle line:84%
If you feel inclined
in this direction,

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.731 align:middle line:84%
you can connect with
Carol through her website

00:58:13.731 --> 00:58:14.430 align:middle line:90%
at ritberger.com.

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:18.831 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us at Gaiam TV.

00:58:18.831 --> 00:58:20.595 align:middle line:90%
