00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.754 align:middle line:84%
Are you in a transition in
your life that is causing you

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.857 align:middle line:84%
to reflect on maybe what's
working or what's not working

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.828 align:middle line:84%
in your life, or did you have
an agenda that didn't work out

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
or that didn't quite
go your way?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.499 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
this today with someone

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
who brings the wisdom of her
years of experiencing successes

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.472 align:middle line:90%
and failures and the wisdom

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.742 align:middle line:84%
of her Greek mother,
Agapi Stassinopoulos.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.277 align:middle line:84%
She is the author
of three books.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.746 align:middle line:84%
Her latest is called
"Unbinding the Heart:

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.981 align:middle line:84%
A Dose of Greek Wisdom,
Generosity,

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.549 align:middle line:90%
and Unconditional Love."

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.084 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for
this conversation.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Agapi Stassinopoulos:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.453 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's great
to have you here, too,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.926 align:middle line:84%
and just to have just an hour
of just grab a cup of coffee

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and have a conversation.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Yes, the Greek way.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The Greek way.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Have something to eat.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Little feta,
little olive oil.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.568 align:middle line:84%
The hour extends
to the afternoon.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's right.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.673 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about your upbringing.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.241 align:middle line:84%
Where did you grow up
and what was it like?

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Well, I
was raised in Athens, Greece,

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:20.646 align:middle line:84%
and it was a beautiful way
to be raised in the country,

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:25.285 align:middle line:84%
that is full of love and a
lot of exuberance, affection.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I was raised with my sister,
Arianna, and my father

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.327 align:middle line:84%
and my mother were separated
when we were very young,

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.395 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in my teenager years.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And the most important thing
around my life is the safety.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.036 align:middle line:84%
There was this feeling
as I was growing

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.673 align:middle line:84%
up of really feeling
loved and cherished.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, my biggest unhappiness
is that my parents separated.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:52.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And
it took years to heal.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, especially as a
teenager or, and as you're going

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.451 align:middle line:84%
through that transition in your
life where you really do need

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.287 align:middle line:84%
to see what relationship
really is all about.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And
losing my father, you know,

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:07.361 align:middle line:84%
who I was very attached to, and
also I had this kind of bond

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:11.098 align:middle line:84%
with my father that I was
responsible for his healing.

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:12.799 align:middle line:84%
I felt he was a man
with a lot of pain,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.736 align:middle line:84%
because he survived
the concentration camps

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:16.837 align:middle line:90%
in the Second World War.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:17.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:18.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
For a year and a half,

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.741 align:middle line:84%
and I write about
all this in my book.

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:25.746 align:middle line:84%
And my mother loved him so much,
but he was unfaithful to her,

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:29.249 align:middle line:90%
and that caused her heartache.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.787 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, you feel
that and you are so helpless

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:38.225 align:middle line:84%
to do anteing about that, and
so that internalizes and a lot

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:41.261 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs start to
set up in your brain

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.596 align:middle line:90%
and in your consciousness.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Like lack of trust.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Lack of
trust, not really trusting

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:53.406 align:middle line:84%
in relationships, also feeling
that what's wrong with me

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.942 align:middle line:84%
that I can't heal that,
and that's irrational.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:03:00.614 align:middle line:84%
But the part of us that
loves and is loved wants --

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.582 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't work
this way on this Earth.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.584 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gives us a manual

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: To say,
this is how it goes.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.421 align:middle line:90%
Well, your mother did.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.991 align:middle line:84%
She gave you quite a manual,
and you share the wisdom

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.493 align:middle line:84%
that she brought you
throughout your entire life.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.529 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture here of your
mother, and she just looks

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.565 align:middle line:90%
so joyous and so happy.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.034 align:middle line:90%
And what were some of the things

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.804 align:middle line:84%
that you absolutely
loved about her?

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Her
fearlessness and her vision.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
She always had this amazing
vision for me and Arianna

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.579 align:middle line:84%
about really fulfilling
our dreams

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.983 align:middle line:84%
of whatever these dreams
you have as a child,

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.086 align:middle line:90%
and she made them happen.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:84%
And it was her tenacity,
her resilience.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.159 align:middle line:84%
Despite of all the challenges
and all the adversities

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.964 align:middle line:84%
that will come her way,
she will find a solution.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.933 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter in
the book that I love.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.235 align:middle line:84%
It's called "There is
Always a Solution."

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.005 align:middle line:84%
And she would demonstrate it
in the midst of adversity.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:84%
And instead of collapsing,
instead of giving up,

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.946 align:middle line:90%
she will rise to the occasion.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:10.817 align:middle line:84%
And my first book I
dedicated to her and I said,

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.588 align:middle line:84%
with a great quote from
Emily Dickinson that says,

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
"You never know how high you
are till you are asked to rise,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:90%
and if we are true to plan.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.834 align:middle line:90%
Our statures touch the skies."

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:31.471 align:middle line:84%
So we never know, and I
said to my mother, Elli ,

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.774 align:middle line:84%
who never put ceilings
on my sky.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
She never said, "Oh,
you can't do this,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.512 align:middle line:90%
darling, you can't do this."

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:42.983 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other greatest
gifts she gave me and Arianna is

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.051 align:middle line:84%
that she never compared
us to each other.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:48.989 align:middle line:84%
Arianna was an amazingly
brilliant academic girl

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:90%
who loved her books.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.191 align:middle line:90%
She loved math.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.926 align:middle line:90%
Who loves math?

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Who loves math?

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: And algebra.

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.031 align:middle line:84%
That's why she started
economics.

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.332 align:middle line:90%
And I love the theater.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.869 align:middle line:84%
I love to dance, I love
to make people happy.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.073 align:middle line:84%
I was a joyful child who just
wanted that, and she never said,

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.975 align:middle line:90%
"Be like your sister."

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So your mother raised
two very successful women,

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:84%
your sister, Arianna
Huffington and you are an author

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.952 align:middle line:84%
and a speaker and you
started off as an actress.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:84%
What was it that she instilled
in you that enabled you both

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.125 align:middle line:84%
to be so successful,
in different ways?

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And not
competitive with each other?

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Exactly,
not compare us ever.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have story after
story, Lisa, of what she did,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.471 align:middle line:84%
and one of my favorite stories
is when we were in middle school

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
and she went to get a
report for our grades,

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:45.212 align:middle line:84%
and she would always come
back with flowers, anemones,

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.047 align:middle line:84%
and she would say,
"Congratulations,

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:49.382 align:middle line:90%
congratulations, you passed."

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.183 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "Mommy,
what did I get?"

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:54.955 align:middle line:84%
And in math and things
like that I would get an F,

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.591 align:middle line:84%
and Arianna would get an
A. And she would say, "Oh,

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.393 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter about
the marks, you passed."

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.496 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I didn't understand
about the math or the algebra --

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:07.801 align:middle line:84%
I had difficulty with
the more academic part --

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:11.271 align:middle line:84%
she would always say to me,
"But we didn't bring you here

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.074 align:middle line:84%
to do math or algebra, you
came here to do your gift."

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:84%
And she knew that my
gift was expression,

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.846 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I ended
up going into acting,

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.948 align:middle line:84%
and that's why she put
me in dance classes.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:24.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's why she called
you Agapi, which means--

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Unconditional
love in Greek, a agapi, agapi.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.391 align:middle line:90%
It's a name she gave me also

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:36.963 align:middle line:84%
because my grandmother was
Russian, Uba, and translated

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle line:84%
in Greek, it was agapi,
and it's the Greek word

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.168 align:middle line:90%
for love, unconditional love.

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.637 align:middle line:90%
It's called actually

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Oxford Dictionary is
the love that God has for man.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks had four kinds of
love, one of them is philia,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.715 align:middle line:84%
friendship, charity, which is
the philanthropic love, eros,

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.851 align:middle line:84%
which is the Aphrodite
love, which we'll talk

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
about that later,
and agape, agapi.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Really?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yeah.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I didn't know that
there were four kinds of love.

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you started off as you
mentioned, as an actress,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.631 align:middle line:84%
and we have this great clip
of you talking about a story

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:15.101 align:middle line:84%
of how you transitioned,
and you found your voice.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.337 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:18.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: "She
turns to me and she says,

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
'I don't know what to do with
you because you have too much

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.877 align:middle line:84%
of a personality and I
can't treat you as an extra,

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:84%
and to be in the chorus
because you stick out,

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.582 align:middle line:84%
and I can't give
you the big parts

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.917 align:middle line:90%
because you're not a start.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.186 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the name
of Sigourney Weaver

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.789 align:middle line:84%
and Susan Sarandon --
I need a big name --

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:40.593 align:middle line:84%
so it breaks my heart,
but I can't hire you.'

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I go home, I am like
Persephone in the underworld,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.966 align:middle line:84%
and I have hit bottom,
rock bottom.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, nothing will happen
to me, I have no life,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.507 align:middle line:84%
I will never get a part, what
am I going to do with my life?

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:84%
And I get on the bus -- I cry
first of all to my mother,

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.713 align:middle line:84%
who says to me, this
is what my mother said.

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:03.049 align:middle line:84%
My mother said, 'Darling,
something better will come,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.753 align:middle line:84%
because my mother knew
better, and she was right.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:09.356 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't
believe her.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:14.094 align:middle line:84%
I get on the bus, and I'm
sitting on the bus and I got in

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:18.131 align:middle line:84%
and I realized everybody looks
much more depressed than I do

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.068 align:middle line:84%
and everybody -- you know
how it is in the bus.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.904 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's recycling their
worries and their bills

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and how they're going
to pay their bills

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.108 align:middle line:90%
and what are they going to do.

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:29.676 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, who
wants to talk to anybody

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.513 align:middle line:84%
and if you touch them a little,
say I'm sorry, you know, like --

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.149 align:middle line:84%
and they look at you
and you feel worse

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:42.956 align:middle line:90%
when you get off the bus,

00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:52.031 align:middle line:84%
because now you have
the collected despair,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:58.571 align:middle line:90%
not just yours.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:02.909 align:middle line:84%
And if you're too
sensitive like I am,

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.445 align:middle line:90%
you pick it up like a sponge.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:09.582 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there, and
I see the woman next to me,

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:15.054 align:middle line:84%
and of course, I'm like
longing to talk to somebody,

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:20.126 align:middle line:84%
because I'm Greek and
you talk to people.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.995 align:middle line:84%
And I turn to her,
and I said, 'You know,

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't get the part.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:28.668 align:middle line:90%
You know, how are you?'

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And she says to me, says,
'Well, I love theater.'

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.974 align:middle line:90%
And I said, 'You do?'

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:39.546 align:middle line:84%
'Yes, I used to be an actress
and now I am a single mom

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:44.484 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a nurse and I
have to support my son

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:45.652 align:middle line:90%
so I don't act anymore.'

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, 'Oh, I understand.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.155 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just
did Joan of Arc.'

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:52.592 align:middle line:84%
I said, 'Would you like
me to do it for you?'

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:57.096 align:middle line:90%
And I turned to her, and I go,

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:06.172 align:middle line:84%
'You promised me my
life but you lied.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You think that life is
nothing but being stone dead.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:20.019 align:middle line:84%
I can live on bread and water,
when have I asked for more?

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.789 align:middle line:84%
But to shut me from
the light of the day,

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to throw me in the
dungeon, chain my feet

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.195 align:middle line:90%
so I can no longer see the sun

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle line:84%
and my wonderful
soldiers passing by --

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:36.002 align:middle line:84%
that is worse than the
furnace in the Bible

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:90%
that was hit at 7 times.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.238 align:middle line:84%
You think you can frighten me
by telling me that I'm alone.

00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:39.439 align:middle line:90%
God is alone and France is alone

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:40.373 align:middle line:84%
and what is my loneliness
before the loneliness

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.574 align:middle line:90%
of my country and my God?

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:42.609 align:middle line:84%
I see now that God's
loneliness is his strength.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:84%
My loneliness will
be my strength, too.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:90%
I will take comfort in His love,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.078 align:middle line:84%
in His console, in
his friendship.

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:46.179 align:middle line:90%
He will not fail me.

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:47.213 align:middle line:84%
But to think you can
take that away from me.

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:48.214 align:middle line:84%
I will go out now to
the common people.

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:48.915 align:middle line:84%
Let the love in their
eyes comfort me

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:49.849 align:middle line:90%
for the hatred in yours.

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
You will be glad
to see me burned,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.985 align:middle line:84%
but if I do through the
fire, I will go through it

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.052 align:middle line:84%
to their hearts forever
and ever.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So light your fire,
and God be with me.'

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:21.414 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think
this woman says to me?

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:24.484 align:middle line:84%
'My dear girl, you're
so talented.'

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, 'I know, but
I can't get the part.'

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:38.431 align:middle line:84%
And she hugged me
and she's crying.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:44.003 align:middle line:84%
And I get off the bus,
and I am 10 feet tall.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I get off the bus and
I get it, man, I get it.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
Years and years of waiting for
one casting director to say,

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.685 align:middle line:84%
'You get the part,'
I got the part.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.421 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, I got me."

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Just sends chills down
my legs when you say "I got me."

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: I got me.

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:08.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I got me.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:09.829 align:middle line:90%
That is so great.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.465 align:middle line:90%
But being a performer, I mean,

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.101 align:middle line:84%
you never stop being a
performer is what I know

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.869 align:middle line:90%
of performers, is you don't--

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes,

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.505 align:middle line:84%
you never stop-- and
here's the thing.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:84%
The hard part of this was to
go to the best drama school

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.511 align:middle line:84%
in the world, The Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts,

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.282 align:middle line:84%
the likes of Maggie
Smith and Helen Mirren

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:30.617 align:middle line:90%
and Anthony Hopkins and--

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:31.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In London.

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:34.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: In
London, and Alan Richman.

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:36.522 align:middle line:90%
And then to be validated

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:41.227 align:middle line:84%
as a really very talented
actress there, and then to go

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:45.431 align:middle line:84%
to Hollywood and not fit
in, it was like a heartache.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.234 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you is that
it was a tremendous heartache

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.671 align:middle line:84%
of not being able to
find my expression.

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.072 align:middle line:90%
And it went on for years.

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I'm sure there are
many, many in that position.

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Exactly,
so now when I look back

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.014 align:middle line:84%
and why I wrote all that
in this book is to tell

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:03.449 align:middle line:84%
when you have this
crisis moment,

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:84%
is because you're not
supposed to fit in.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:10.923 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to dive
in and excavate inside

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.426 align:middle line:90%
and say, "What is my calling?"

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.928 align:middle line:90%
And I feel so passionate

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.997 align:middle line:84%
about helping people
find their calling.

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:20.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Create your
own voice within it.

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:21.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes,
and there are keys,

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:84%
and there are ways, and
why now I am out there

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:28.174 align:middle line:84%
in the world speaking
and inspiring people

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:90%
to say, hey, I got mine.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.649 align:middle line:84%
I got me, and not the career
and not the projects, I got me.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.717 align:middle line:90%
And then you go create.

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you have
found your moment,

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.521 align:middle line:90%
you have found your calling.

00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:43.156 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that your mother said

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.957 align:middle line:90%
to you, which I wrote down.

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:46.492 align:middle line:90%
"Don't miss the moment."

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:84%
That was one of her
favorite things.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Well, that's
what happened in the bus.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.531 align:middle line:90%
I didn't miss the moment.

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:54.367 align:middle line:84%
You see, the transition
that happened for me was

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:58.905 align:middle line:84%
that I was you know,
recycling my depression

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:02.041 align:middle line:84%
about not getting the part and
I was in it, and then you go

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:84%
like Persephone, the
goddess of the underworld,

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:07.046 align:middle line:84%
you're in the underworld
and you are feeling bad.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.481 align:middle line:90%
And you feel there's no hope,

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.316 align:middle line:84%
there's no rope,
there is no light.

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Over and over.

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:13.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: But
if you just say, okay,

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.988 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about that later.

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.356 align:middle line:90%
When does it stay open?

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't close down
because you don't know.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.997 align:middle line:84%
Because spirit, the
spirit in us puts the seed

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:28.067 align:middle line:90%
of creativity in all of us.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.636 align:middle line:90%
So find that creative spark.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But how do
you know when to go

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:36.542 align:middle line:84%
for that creative spark and
to stop with chasing the dream

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.112 align:middle line:84%
that you thought was
the perfect dream?

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:39.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: That's right.

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.647 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:42.915 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.918 align:middle line:84%
You just -- and it took me
years, Lisa, to find that,

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.286 align:middle line:90%
because not just with a career.

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:49.789 align:middle line:84%
Then I went into producing
and things wouldn't work out.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:55.628 align:middle line:84%
One after the other, it was like
the universe was telling me,

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:58.331 align:middle line:84%
okay, sweetheart, try that
but that's not your thing.

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:01.901 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, what is my thing?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:06.906 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
developing the One Woman Show.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.908 align:middle line:90%
When I realized the production

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.444 align:middle line:84%
and the big dreams were
not happening, I said,

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:13.613 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
act what I love

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:15.681 align:middle line:84%
which is the stories
of the Goddesses.

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, brilliant.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: So you take
that and you don't make it

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.822 align:middle line:84%
about the world, you
make it about expressing.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.223 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe
it is starting

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:27.293 align:middle line:84%
to tell young kids
fairy stories.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.029 align:middle line:84%
Find something -- maybe it's
cooking, maybe it's gardening.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's making --

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's all of that.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
It's all of that.

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:37.436 align:middle line:84%
And as you start,
you become alive.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.239 align:middle line:84%
You see, I think part
of the mistake we do

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:43.676 align:middle line:84%
in this world is we think
it's these achievements

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and these bigger things, and
we lose track that the soul

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.652 align:middle line:84%
and the heart wants the real
thing, the real expression.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:55.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, look, you are
such an amazing storyteller

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
and you have your
degree in psychology.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Yes, that's where a lot

00:15:58.457 --> 00:15:59.625 align:middle line:90%
of healing happened for me.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.829 align:middle line:84%
I went to the University
of Santa Monica

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.765 align:middle line:84%
and did tremendous
amount of inner work,

00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:08.334 align:middle line:84%
because to get there
you got to put the work.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:09.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, you have
to do your own work.

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: It's really

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.672 align:middle line:84%
like developing your
muscles in the gym.

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.809 align:middle line:84%
This next clip we have is all
about letting your agenda go.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.644 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Just
letting your agenda go.

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:25.084 align:middle line:84%
"And I ask you all to just call
yourself forward at this moment,

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:30.923 align:middle line:84%
at this incredible conference
to serve one another,

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:33.559 align:middle line:90%
to let go of your agendas,

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to let go of what you think
our projects are in our lives.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.566 align:middle line:84%
Most of them in my
life didn't happen.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Most of the men I thought I'd
marry, I never married them.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.642 align:middle line:84%
But what mattered is when
I let go of my agendas,

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:53.045 align:middle line:90%
the spirit took over and today,

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I asked you to bring forward
your spark to ignite each other

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.188 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, like
the woman in the bus.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.758 align:middle line:84%
Like that moment, let
your moment appear

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:10.029 align:middle line:84%
and that is your
portable paradise.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
That we have with
us every moment.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:20.106 align:middle line:84%
Claim it, have it, it's yours
for the taking, participating

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.674 align:middle line:90%
and enriching your lives."

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:24.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What is the message
that you wanted to leave people

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:26.345 align:middle line:84%
with in the book
"Unbinding the Heart"?

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:28.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: That
no matter what we go

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
through in our lives, as long as
we keep the eye on the thought

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.857 align:middle line:84%
that really what matters is
to get back to ourselves,

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:42.762 align:middle line:84%
that everything is recycling us
back to get back to the heart,

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:90%
to get back to the soul,

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.432 align:middle line:84%
to get back to the
authenticity of who we are.

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what's
the first step?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.603 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're lost, you're
out there, you have a dream

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:52.004 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't get realized.

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:55.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Okay, four
magic words: Can you help me?

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:56.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ask that?

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:84%
People say "How are you,"
and you say "Great," say,

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:01.814 align:middle line:90%
"You know, I'm feeling lost.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:05.551 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know if
I'm doing the right thing,

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.454 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going the right
way, if the man I'm going

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:09.889 align:middle line:90%
to marry is the right man,

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:12.725 align:middle line:84%
if the career I have isn't
giving me satisfaction.

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:15.594 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm on a nomadic.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel like" -- a lot
of people say to me,

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.265 align:middle line:90%
"I'm missing in action.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.767 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing my life
but I'm not in it.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.504 align:middle line:84%
That there's a whole part
of me that's not there."

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:27.239 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do that?

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:30.109 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's a
very personal thing.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.511 align:middle line:84%
So it's not -- you say,
well, Agapi did it this way

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.614 align:middle line:84%
and Lisa did it this way,
and Mary did it this way

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:39.852 align:middle line:84%
and there is Frank Sinatra sang
about it, "I did it my way."

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:43.923 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, okay, we're
going to find your way.

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:47.026 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who are amazing mentors.

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:50.429 align:middle line:84%
There are friends
that you go to.

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.331 align:middle line:84%
There is meditation,
there is prayer.

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:56.869 align:middle line:84%
I believe very, very
much that the spirit

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:59.538 align:middle line:84%
in us is always there
to help us.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:02.241 align:middle line:84%
Rumi said, "Life is
rigged in your favor."

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:08.547 align:middle line:84%
That the spirit, God, whatever
we call it, the universal love,

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:13.586 align:middle line:84%
wants us to win, wants us not
to win in the way we should win

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:19.058 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but in the
way of really getting to us.

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:22.962 align:middle line:84%
And for me, Lisa, that
calling to find agapi,

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:27.266 align:middle line:84%
to find who I was, was as much
as I wanted my next breath.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:30.436 align:middle line:84%
So I found my spiritual
teacher, who is in Los Angeles,

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:32.204 align:middle line:90%
and I have my spiritual path.

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:35.441 align:middle line:84%
I found the University of Santa
Monica, because when you say,

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:38.811 align:middle line:84%
you know, the first thing
is admit how you're feeling

00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:41.881 align:middle line:84%
and not make it wrong,
don't judge it.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.349 align:middle line:90%
Like and in your daily life.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:46.085 align:middle line:84%
You know how work my daily
life to keep my energy up,

00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:48.254 align:middle line:90%
I tell myself how I am.

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I used to walk around with a
knot in my stomach till I found

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
out that the knot in my
stomach was a little girl

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.196 align:middle line:84%
that had not been loved,
that she felt like an orphan.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.999 align:middle line:84%
She felt like -- big Agapi was
out there doing the big things,

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.302 align:middle line:84%
but nobody was talking to her,
how she was feeling lonely,

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:07.039 align:middle line:84%
how she was feeling separate,
how she was feeling not enough.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I worked that part, and it's
almost like your rising yourself

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.211 align:middle line:90%
to your consciousness.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.113 align:middle line:90%
That is what consciousness is.

00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:15.915 align:middle line:90%
You're healing yourself.

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:90%
You're humanist.

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, and in
that healing, though,

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.288 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to
be an award show.

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:25.424 align:middle line:84%
It can be just the realization
of that healing, right?

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:26.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: That's right.

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:31.997 align:middle line:84%
It's a moment of really
becoming aware of your feelings,

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts, your hurts, your
separations, and then that's

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
where the heart comes in,
because you bring your heart

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.277 align:middle line:84%
into it and you take
yourself in, you forgive it,

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:48.447 align:middle line:84%
you trace it, because it's in
your body, it's in the memories,

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:52.251 align:middle line:84%
it's in the moment sometimes,
and where you feel separate

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:56.322 align:middle line:84%
or hurt, and then you
evolve yourself to that.

00:20:56.322 --> 00:20:59.592 align:middle line:84%
You heal it, you raise
yourself and you say well,

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.262 align:middle line:84%
there is a bigger part
in me that is not --

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.464 align:middle line:84%
you don't just identify
with that,

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:09.101 align:middle line:84%
and that misidentification
is where a lot of people feel

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.904 align:middle line:84%
that -- I want to say
almost like misery.

00:21:11.904 --> 00:21:13.239 align:middle line:90%
You feel miserable.

00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:17.576 align:middle line:84%
You feel walking around not
feeling good about yourself.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And almost
you feel at a loss,

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
like you're mourning
a death of something

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.749 align:middle line:90%
that isn't working out.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
That isn't working out,

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's marriages
and relationships and work.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.092 align:middle line:90%
And then, as you let go --

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:36.295 align:middle line:84%
because so much of our
lives is the letting go --

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:40.633 align:middle line:84%
then there is space for
who you are to come in.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.836 align:middle line:84%
And that's when happened to
me, is that once I let go

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:46.672 align:middle line:84%
of this attachment -- because
attachment, I've got to have

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:49.942 align:middle line:84%
that or I'm not going
to be happy.

00:21:49.942 --> 00:21:52.711 align:middle line:84%
And that's -- it's like this,
you're holding on so tight

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.481 align:middle line:84%
and so you say, okay,
I might never have that

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.049 align:middle line:90%
and you know what, I'm okay.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How to let go of your
dream and be okay with it.

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:02.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And be okay
with it, because your vision

00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:05.724 align:middle line:84%
of who you are is
bigger than your dream.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So you go for your vision,
and your vision is not just

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.234 align:middle line:84%
about you, and that
is the greatest key,

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:19.838 align:middle line:84%
because it's really finding,
what is it that you have

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:90%
to offer in the world?

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:25.344 align:middle line:84%
And when you get --
you said something

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.912 align:middle line:84%
so beautiful before
the show started.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:30.849 align:middle line:84%
You said, okay, we took care
of ourselves, we got us here,

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:33.485 align:middle line:84%
we got dressed, we got
made up, we did our hair,

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.454 align:middle line:90%
and now let's forget about us.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:40.893 align:middle line:84%
So we focus on why we need to
give, what we have to offer.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:45.798 align:middle line:84%
My mother used to say, you
would say to her, "I love this,"

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:48.334 align:middle line:90%
and she'd say, "Yeah, take it."

00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And the person would say,
"What can I give you back,"

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.305 align:middle line:84%
and she'll say, "It's
not a trade,

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:90%
darling, it's an offering."

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Aw, wow, how wonderful.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Imagine if
we walked around and we said,

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.615 align:middle line:84%
"You know, God, I
don't really feel good,

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:04.617 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel great today.

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:09.021 align:middle line:84%
I feel I don't have much to
give but I'll give what I have."

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:14.226 align:middle line:84%
And this reaching
out unbinds you.

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.295 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:17.296 align:middle line:90%
Reach out.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:19.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what
being bound is.

00:23:19.365 --> 00:23:22.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Is like you
start to suffocate yourself

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:24.203 align:middle line:84%
with judgments, with
comparisons,

00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting what I want,

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not good enough,
and it's collective.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
It's not just yours or mine,
it's in the human collective.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.815 align:middle line:84%
And you absorb it and
you have not only yours

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:39.051 align:middle line:84%
but you have the human --
because people project that,

00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.486 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, well, you're
not important enough

00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
but you are important enough."

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:84%
And who is important, who is
not according to positions,

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:46.759 align:middle line:90%
according to our materiality,

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.128 align:middle line:84%
according to what we
have, what we achieve.

00:23:49.128 --> 00:23:58.137 align:middle line:84%
And if we can go beyond that and
go into the lack of separation

00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:02.274 align:middle line:84%
and reaching out, then
it kind of disappears

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.309 align:middle line:90%
because it's an illusion.

00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:04.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Then you stay open.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:05.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Then you stay open.

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what this next
clip is about, is staying open.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.982 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:24:09.982 --> 00:24:11.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
"How do you get there?

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:14.153 align:middle line:84%
How do we get there
to find ourselves

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:18.223 align:middle line:84%
and to say 'I've got me and now
I can share me with people.'

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:21.627 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey, it's a
journey, but it's there.

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:22.761 align:middle line:90%
It's there for the taking.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:25.698 align:middle line:90%
It's step by step by step.

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:28.767 align:middle line:90%
So there are no 7 or 8 ways.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:29.802 align:middle line:90%
There are none.

00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:31.337 align:middle line:90%
There's one choice.

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:33.405 align:middle line:90%
There's one choice.

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:39.978 align:middle line:84%
The choice is do you shut
down or do you stay open

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
when things don't happen the
way you want them to happen?

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.888 align:middle line:84%
And when things don't happen
the way we want them to happen,

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:54.727 align:middle line:84%
and we choose to say, 'I'm open,
I'm open, I'm not closing down,

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:57.496 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to feel resentful,
I'm not going to feel rejected,

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.897 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to feel unworthy.

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:02.868 align:middle line:84%
I am going to stay open,'
other things happen.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.636 align:middle line:90%
And you know what happens?

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.072 align:middle line:90%
You happen.

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:08.607 align:middle line:90%
We happen to ourselves.

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.677 align:middle line:84%
We connect with ourselves,
with our light, with our soul,

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:17.015 align:middle line:84%
because our soul, the GPS
for our soul is coming in

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:20.486 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to guide
us, and we're all part

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:90%
of the collective soul.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.921 align:middle line:90%
That's what Plato said.

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:25.824 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of that one
soul, part of one heart.

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:84%
We are connected like
islands in the deep.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We're separate but this
is illusion separation.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.301 align:middle line:84%
Right now come present
in your heart

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:40.439 align:middle line:84%
and imagine right now a golden
vein going into one person

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:44.209 align:middle line:84%
and another person, surrounding
this whole beautiful auditorium,

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:49.548 align:middle line:84%
we are one heart --
and that's the truth

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:54.586 align:middle line:84%
that I stand before you as a
living testament to the fact

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:84%
that all that matters is
not what happens out there,

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:03.762 align:middle line:84%
but how you turn inside to
connect with you and love all

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:05.831 align:middle line:90%
of you unconditionally."

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:08.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: All right, so you have
these great tips in the book

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
on essential tips
to live your life,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.539 align:middle line:84%
and I'd love to hear
some of them.

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:16.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: One of
the tips I love is don't try

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:90%
to fix yourself or your life,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.046 align:middle line:84%
because fixing it
starts to manipulate it.

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:23.782 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, let things be
as they are and then start

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:28.554 align:middle line:84%
to find your alignment
with your inner spirit.

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:84%
And that alignment is -- and how
I found my confidence and that's

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:36.361 align:middle line:84%
in the chapter of finding your
voice, how I started to write --

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:39.431 align:middle line:84%
which was terrifying for
me, how I started to write

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.967 align:middle line:84%
and not thinking I
had anything to say.

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:44.203 align:middle line:84%
And a friend came over
and she had me write this

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:49.541 align:middle line:84%
on the bulletin board that
I had in my living room.

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:52.778 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "You have
everything you need

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:56.114 align:middle line:84%
to write this book but you
lack one thing, confidence.

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do you find
confidence is knowing

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.452 align:middle line:90%
that you're not alone."

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:04.089 align:middle line:84%
And I took a big piece of paper,
and I wrote "God is my partner."

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:07.025 align:middle line:84%
And I have ancient
wisdom that's in me,

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:10.229 align:middle line:90%
and the spirit works with me.

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:13.799 align:middle line:84%
The creative force is within
us, and as I opened up

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.402 align:middle line:84%
and trust that, and kind
of acting as if, as if,

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:20.739 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't believe it,
the channels start to open.

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:26.178 align:middle line:84%
So bonding, making sure that
you know you're not alone even

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:27.446 align:middle line:90%
if you feel alone.

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:28.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, what
happens as you said,

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:31.683 align:middle line:84%
try not to fix your life,
but what if there are things

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that need fixing, where you're
in an abusive relationship

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.458 align:middle line:84%
or having financial
debt problems,

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:40.792 align:middle line:90%
things that need fixing?

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
It's more than fixing.

00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:46.365 align:middle line:84%
It's more the awareness
that it's putting yourself

00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:49.735 align:middle line:90%
in the corrected channel.

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:52.971 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start to
fix it, it's like you start

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:57.409 align:middle line:84%
to judge it, and if you judge
it, then you're stuck in it.

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:59.311 align:middle line:90%
You're like imprisoned by it.

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:01.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you go
into the channel of--

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:02.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: --
of self-correcting.

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:06.285 align:middle line:84%
It's like you go into
the different track.

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:09.821 align:middle line:84%
Like we are in a track
that's leaking, let's say,

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
so then you start to go into
another track that is straight.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:17.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Fixing the debt
-- or not fixing but--

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:19.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Self-correcting.

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:21.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Correcting the debt,
correcting the relationship,

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
but you go into that channel
rather than into the broken--

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes,
because then you can share,

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.907 align:middle line:84%
there's something wrong
with me; I need to fix that.

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:32.744 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very erroneous
approach, because the being

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:37.449 align:middle line:84%
that is whole, it's almost
like stepping into a more

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:42.554 align:middle line:84%
of a holistic place inside of
you that starts to give you keys

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:47.125 align:middle line:84%
and awarenesses and
strength and confidence.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That makes sense.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.429 align:middle line:84%
I can actually see
how that would be

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
so much more empowering.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: It's
a different perception.

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:54.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And plus, you
get into that place

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:90%
where it's about consciousness.

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:84%
So the five questions, because
I feel so passionate about this

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:04.142 align:middle line:84%
when people say,
what is my calling,

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.577 align:middle line:90%
how do I find my purpose.

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:09.781 align:middle line:84%
And I say, ask yourself daily
these questions: What am I here

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:13.719 align:middle line:84%
to learn, what am I here
to teach, what am I here

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:17.789 align:middle line:84%
to overcome, what am
I here to complete,

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.558 align:middle line:90%
and what am I here to share?

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:20.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:23.061 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself those
questions every day.

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Well, while
you're driving on the freeway

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
and you're going, you're
upset or you're late

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:31.737 align:middle line:84%
or you are impatient with a
colleague or with your boss

00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:34.072 align:middle line:84%
or with your children
or with your husband,

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:37.709 align:middle line:84%
or something is not moving in
your life and you're impatient.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.011 align:middle line:90%
We've all had that and you say,

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:40.846 align:middle line:84%
"this is not moving
fast enough."

00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.348 align:middle line:84%
Or you're afraid
you're going to fail.

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:46.618 align:middle line:84%
And you say, something like
telling yourself, "Sweetheart,"

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.253 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why not be
sweet to ourselves?

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:50.889 align:middle line:84%
Talk sweetly to --
I say, "Sweetheart,

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.391 align:middle line:90%
what am I here to learn."

00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:55.594 align:middle line:84%
And you go, "I'm here to
learn patience right now.

00:29:55.594 --> 00:29:59.364 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to learn
the highest vision.

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to listen.

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:03.201 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to teach?"

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:84%
It could be that sometimes
you're just teaching someone

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.241 align:middle line:84%
that they are safe
just the way they are.

00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:13.445 align:middle line:84%
We can connect in that
amazing transparent place

00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:14.713 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:18.016 align:middle line:84%
That is so powerful,
because we are transparent.

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.918 align:middle line:90%
We go beyond our skin.

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:20.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:21.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: And here --

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.755 align:middle line:84%
although our boundaries
are like that,

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:25.457 align:middle line:90%
but inside of us we understand.

00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:28.827 align:middle line:84%
We see, what am I
here to overcome?

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.329 align:middle line:84%
We're always overcoming
something, Lisa, all of us.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.831 align:middle line:90%
No one is exempt.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:90%
We're overcoming something.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.137 align:middle line:84%
It could be a physical,
emotional, mental thing.

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.972 align:middle line:90%
And what am I here to complete?

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:45.444 align:middle line:84%
And you say, you know, for me,
as you know, it took me years

00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:48.513 align:middle line:84%
to understand, and I wrote about
this in the book, a sabbatical

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:53.552 align:middle line:84%
for men, that I didn't need to
have the great men in my life

00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:56.254 align:middle line:84%
who loved me and adored
me or the great companion

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:59.024 align:middle line:84%
or the great love,
or to feel whole.

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.192 align:middle line:90%
That was a big thing.

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.461 align:middle line:84%
I told my spiritual
teacher one day

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.162 align:middle line:84%
on my birthday, "I'm
still single."

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:07.099 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You're
singular, not single, singular.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
It means you're whole
in yourself."

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You're whole
in yourself.

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: So you're
not always looking, oh,

00:31:11.937 --> 00:31:15.674 align:middle line:84%
if only I had this man to
make me feel fantastic.

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:17.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: No, it's like the
Greek goddesses we're going

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:18.543 align:middle line:90%
to talk about.

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:19.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Some of those
archetypes really define that--

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Totally.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, which I love --

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:25.383 align:middle line:84%
you have such a great
perspective on all of that.

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.718 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.154 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take a look
really quickly at a video

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:30.789 align:middle line:90%
that you did with Marlo Thomas.

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:31.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:33.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And more tips
for living your life.

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:35.961 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at Agapi
Stassinopoulos.

00:31:35.961 --> 00:31:41.933 align:middle line:90%
[ Background noise ]

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:44.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Marlo Thomas: This is
from Michelle Madison.

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:47.405 align:middle line:84%
What are a few tips that almost
everyone can apply to their life

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.874 align:middle line:90%
so they can find more happiness?

00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:49.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: All right.

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:50.275 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Michelle.

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:52.511 align:middle line:90%
I have five great tips.

00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:54.246 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:57.149 align:middle line:84%
The first one is something
that I have learned

00:31:57.149 --> 00:32:01.119 align:middle line:84%
from my own life a lot, which
is ask for what you want.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.487 align:middle line:90%
Ask people.

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.422 align:middle line:84%
When you want something, tell
people what it is you want.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:08.426 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference
between demanding or asking.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.595 align:middle line:90%
When you ask and they say no,

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.698 align:middle line:84%
they can't help,
ask the next one.

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:16.234 align:middle line:84%
I usually have this
little technique, say,

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:19.805 align:middle line:84%
ask at least 12 people
for what you want

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and start to see what happens.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.944 align:middle line:84%
Also, the asking gives you
a message that you deserve

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.947 align:middle line:84%
to receive and you
deserve to be supported.

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:31.883 align:middle line:84%
The other one is to
find your spark in life.

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:35.887 align:middle line:84%
If you have a job or if you
have something that you're doing

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:39.157 align:middle line:84%
that you are not as
happy, find still something

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:42.394 align:middle line:84%
that really activates
you, that enlivens you,

00:32:42.394 --> 00:32:46.698 align:middle line:84%
that makes you feel happy,
and start doing more of that.

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:50.902 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is I
always say to people,

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.371 align:middle line:84%
when you want something,
hold the thought

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.773 align:middle line:90%
of what it is you want.

00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Think more of the thoughts of
what it is you want to achieve

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.313 align:middle line:90%
or want to feel like, so more

00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:05.984 align:middle line:84%
of what creates the thing
you want is the thoughts

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.786 align:middle line:90%
and consistency.

00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:10.322 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you want
a promotion, hold the thought

00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:90%
of getting a promotion.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.925 align:middle line:90%
If you say to yourself,

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.027 align:middle line:84%
"I'll never get a
promotion," then you won't.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:17.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:18.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
And then it's hard

00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:21.299 align:middle line:84%
to turn your disappointments
into opportunities,

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:23.101 align:middle line:90%
things that don't work out.

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that in my life
the things that did not work

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:31.209 align:middle line:84%
out were as substantial and
effective and enlightening

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:35.347 align:middle line:84%
in a way, as the things
that did work out.

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:39.417 align:middle line:84%
The fifth tip that I trust
and always works in my life is

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:44.923 align:middle line:84%
that if I want to feel empowered
or feel more good about myself

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:46.858 align:middle line:90%
in the day or in my life,

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.095 align:middle line:84%
is help someone else
get what they want.

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:54.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you have written
a book, "The Conversations

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:57.168 align:middle line:84%
with Goddesses,"
and two books on --

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:59.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And "Gods
and Goddesses in Love," yes.

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:03.541 align:middle line:84%
Well, Lisa, at some point the
goddesses took over my life

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.543 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "You're
under contract with us.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.946 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how it happened,

00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:11.549 align:middle line:84%
but I wrote this One Woman show
which I performed everywhere,

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.485 align:middle line:84%
at the Getty Museum,
at colleges.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:14.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What was it?

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:18.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: It was the
seven goddesses, their stories,

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:84%
the myth, as we know, their
archetype, and then a monologue

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.362 align:middle line:84%
for each one of them
so I could act.

00:34:25.362 --> 00:34:27.831 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said, once a
performer, always a performer,

00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:32.304 align:middle line:84%
so I did Jocasta for Demeter
and Joan of Arc for Athena

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:36.007 align:middle line:84%
and Lina Szczepanowska from
the Bernard Show and Arethea

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:43.648 align:middle line:84%
from Bernard Show and on and on,
all these brilliant monologues.

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:46.418 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "what if
this goddess could speak,

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:48.152 align:middle line:90%
this is what she would say."

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:50.655 align:middle line:84%
And come alive, and then
I would teach people how

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to become this archetype, how
to embody it, how to evoke it,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.029 align:middle line:84%
how to bring it more conscious
in their body, in their mind.

00:34:58.029 --> 00:35:00.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, this is
extremely educational.

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.633 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Very educational,

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:03.735 align:middle line:84%
and I love this book
which is now out of print

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:05.003 align:middle line:84%
"Conversation with
the Goddesses."

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:06.071 align:middle line:90%
it's my first baby.

00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:09.841 align:middle line:84%
And what -- shall
we talk about this?

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:13.611 align:middle line:84%
I think what I want to do
is I want to show a clip

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:17.749 align:middle line:84%
of you doing this incredible
monologue, and you're talking

00:35:17.749 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:90%
about the Greek goddess Artemis?

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Artemis, Diana, exactly,

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of the hunt,
the goddess of independence

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.661 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, but the
goddess of boundaries.

00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:30.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Boundaries.

00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We could talk hours and hours
and hours on boundaries.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Boundaries, yes.

00:35:33.932 --> 00:35:36.868 align:middle line:84%
If people want to learn how
to set boundaries and say,

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:41.306 align:middle line:84%
"this is my space, this is where
I begin and end and this is

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:43.942 align:middle line:84%
where you begin and end
and we don't merge."

00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:45.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's such an issue.

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Such an issue.

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's an
issue with saying no,

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.714 align:middle line:84%
it's an issue with
saying all that.

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:53.151 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the performance
of Agapi doing Artemis,

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.153 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get back to
some of the conversations

00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:56.988 align:middle line:84%
about Athena and all of the
other wonderful goddesses.

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Artemis
is not about relationships.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
She's about one fundamental
relationship,

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.965 align:middle line:90%
the relationship with herself.

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:12.137 align:middle line:84%
Artemis, the goddess of the
hunt, the goddess of the moon,

00:36:12.137 --> 00:36:17.776 align:middle line:84%
she's driven by physical energy,
not erotic like an Aphrodite,

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:21.312 align:middle line:84%
not the mind, like Athena,
not the bond of marriage

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:26.484 align:middle line:84%
but the physicality of life,
her love affair with nature.

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:32.824 align:middle line:84%
She is bold, she is strong, she
is skillful, she has her bow

00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:38.463 align:middle line:84%
and arrow which she
directs, she's single-minded.

00:36:38.463 --> 00:36:42.967 align:middle line:84%
She's defined by no
bond, no relationship

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.203 align:middle line:90%
and her whole relationship is

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:49.307 align:middle line:84%
because she feels
complete with herself.

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:54.646 align:middle line:84%
So women, if you ever feel
that you can be complete

00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:58.983 align:middle line:84%
within yourself without
a man, you're right on.

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:01.152 align:middle line:90%
You're right on Artemis.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.787 align:middle line:90%
You're right on her archetype.

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So talk
to us about Athena.

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:09.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Well,
Athena is the goddess of wisdom

00:37:09.094 --> 00:37:12.263 align:middle line:90%
and compassion and strategist.

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.665 align:middle line:90%
She's brilliant.

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:16.868 align:middle line:84%
She lives in her head and her
intelligence and in her vision.

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:20.138 align:middle line:84%
So for women who want
to access more --

00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:21.873 align:middle line:84%
you said when people
have problems

00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:26.778 align:middle line:84%
or they have difficulty,
they also have wisdom,

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:29.047 align:middle line:84%
they also can access
that part of them

00:37:29.047 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:84%
or they can educate
themselves about that part.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:36.354 align:middle line:84%
And wisdom is an amazing
key to having your life.

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:38.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, and sometimes
we don't hit that wisdom

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:41.359 align:middle line:84%
until we get into the
second half of our life.

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:44.195 align:middle line:84%
Or children have
a lot of wisdom.

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: They do.

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: But you know,
we shut them off sometimes.

00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:48.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We tell
them to be quiet,

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:49.801 align:middle line:90%
their opinion doesn't matter.

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:53.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yeah, and
that's detrimental for a child,

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:57.275 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of children are
just born with this wisdom.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So can you call on
these gods and goddesses.

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: You know
one of the greatest gifts,

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.714 align:middle line:84%
which I want to share
with our viewers,

00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:90%
is start to write things down.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.519 align:middle line:84%
When I did Workshop
of the Goddesses,

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I said pick an archetype and
we'll do the whole process

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.491 align:middle line:90%
that you want to work with,

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.593 align:middle line:84%
and then converse
with that archetype.

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.362 align:middle line:84%
It's called Conversations
with the Goddesses.

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, and so if you
were to converse with Athena?

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:21.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Or with
Athena, you would say,

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:25.403 align:middle line:84%
help me find a solution
in this problem,

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:27.138 align:middle line:90%
and then the wisdom comes

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:30.875 align:middle line:84%
in because the wisdom
is embedded in us.

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.411 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence
is embedded in us.

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:34.913 align:middle line:84%
It's in our soul,
it's in our DNA.

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:37.048 align:middle line:90%
We just have to unearth it.

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:41.419 align:middle line:84%
We have to get out of
our own way to start --

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
see, I didn't know what I knew
till I got out of my own way

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.593 align:middle line:84%
and let go of my agendas, the
things that I wanted to badly,

00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:52.096 align:middle line:84%
and then I showed up and I
said, "Wow, that's way better

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.298 align:middle line:90%
than having an acting career."

00:38:53.298 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah, wow.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: I showed up.

00:38:56.434 --> 00:39:01.072 align:middle line:84%
And when you show up, a lot of
times, and if you read any kind

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:03.541 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual journeys
of a lot of people,

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:90%
they show up when they let go

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.579 align:middle line:84%
of what they think
they should become.

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:09.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is so
important for men as well,

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:12.684 align:middle line:84%
because when men feel
that their identity is

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:14.619 align:middle line:90%
so wrapped into their career--

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:17.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes, yes,
and they suffer so much.

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:20.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Then if the career
ends, then the identity ends,

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:23.494 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a
lost ground there.

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:25.096 align:middle line:90%
What can you suggest?

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:28.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: You
want me to help men now?

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:29.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Helping
everyone today, yes.

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Okay,

00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:32.704 align:middle line:84%
let's help the men a
little bit, they need help.

00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:36.941 align:middle line:84%
So they can love us more
and they can worship us.

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You are a goddess.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Raising
children and raising men.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:50.021 align:middle line:84%
I think the men conditioning
is very binding

00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:90%
in our society, very binding.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:57.629 align:middle line:84%
The paternal patriarchy
archetype is very binding

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:00.698 align:middle line:84%
to the men and is binding
to the woman, and I suffered

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.433 align:middle line:84%
that with my father
and so did my mother

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:06.738 align:middle line:84%
because he was a very
bound male, but more

00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:09.707 align:middle line:84%
and more amazing
men are ushering

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.376 align:middle line:90%
in our world, as you know.

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:14.178 align:middle line:84%
You've had many of those
amazing men on your shows

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:17.915 align:middle line:84%
who speak wisdom and truth,
and these are the role models.

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.318 align:middle line:90%
These are the new role models.

00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And my consciousness
and my heart is

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.594 align:middle line:84%
to really love these men
and really not surrender

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.562 align:middle line:90%
to what they think is right,

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:34.332 align:middle line:84%
to really allow them
their expression but also

00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:38.136 align:middle line:84%
to be very strong in ourselves,
to show them maybe a way,

00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:41.639 align:middle line:84%
that there is another
way to do life.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:44.676 align:middle line:84%
There is another way to think,
there is another way to be,

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:46.244 align:middle line:90%
and help them open their hearts.

00:40:46.244 --> 00:40:47.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Right, what
you're talking

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:50.481 align:middle line:84%
about of letting go your
agenda and showing up.

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:53.818 align:middle line:84%
And men have incredible
talents and they've gained

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:56.954 align:middle line:84%
such experiences, just as
women have from our lives,

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:90%
our jobs, whatever it is.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:84%
In many positions people have
been laid off in this situation

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.729 align:middle line:84%
or jobs have completely
disappeared.

00:41:04.729 --> 00:41:05.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Absolutely.

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:06.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mergers have happened

00:41:06.531 --> 00:41:08.633 align:middle line:84%
and people have lost
their careers.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:09.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
And yet so many

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:14.172 align:middle line:84%
of these men also start amazing
new projects, and you look

00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:17.775 align:middle line:84%
at the new generation and
these people are living

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.877 align:middle line:90%
in the entrepreneurial spirit,

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:22.814 align:middle line:84%
which is creating new
opportunities for themselves

00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:26.384 align:middle line:84%
and others, and we
see that everywhere.

00:41:26.384 --> 00:41:29.954 align:middle line:84%
So the new generation
is almost smarter.

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:32.357 align:middle line:84%
And they looked around and
said, I don't want that.

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:35.493 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be stuck
in a job like that.

00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.695 align:middle line:90%
They go for the creativity.

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, they're
having to adapt, because many

00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:40.998 align:middle line:84%
of those job positions
that they studied

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.067 align:middle line:84%
for in college are
no longer there.

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So even the whole
careers themselves.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.774 align:middle line:84%
So it's about letting go
of the agenda, opening up,

00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:52.009 align:middle line:84%
showing up -- let's get
back to the Green goddesses.

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:54.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And
not being afraid to fail.

00:41:54.045 --> 00:41:58.116 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of those start-ups
and businesses, like fail

00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:00.718 align:middle line:90%
and fail, and start again.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:01.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And still
learn something.

00:42:01.786 --> 00:42:03.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So some of the -- you
said the modern-day counterparts

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of Athena would include
Gloria Steinem.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Gloria Steinem for sure,

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:16.234 align:middle line:84%
and Hillary Clinton and
Madeline Wright then

00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:20.938 align:middle line:84%
and it's Susan Sontag,
and Joan of Arc

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.241 align:middle line:90%
of course is an archetype.

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:25.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So these are
goddesses of wisdom?

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And the arts.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And the arts
and in each area they thrive,

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:32.884 align:middle line:90%
so that it's different areas,

00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:35.219 align:middle line:84%
this archetype can
really thrive.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:38.556 align:middle line:84%
Her sister -- shall we
talk about her sister?

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Artemis?

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Who we just saw --

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
she really embodies the
spirit of fearlessness.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.669 align:middle line:84%
She's the goddess of the
hunt and the boundaries

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:56.674 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about, and it's
really where I think to open

00:42:56.674 --> 00:43:02.413 align:middle line:84%
up your heart, you need
boundaries, and you need to set

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.682 align:middle line:90%
like your river banks.

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:07.552 align:middle line:84%
So that a lot of times
we share our heart

00:43:07.552 --> 00:43:09.821 align:middle line:84%
but we share our
emotional heart,

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:12.523 align:middle line:84%
or we wear our heart
on our sleeve.

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:16.828 align:middle line:84%
That's not the heart
that is the mighty heart.

00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:18.896 align:middle line:84%
The mighty heart is
the spiritual heart

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.965 align:middle line:90%
that really lives

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:84%
in our spiritual body,
and that is in us.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:30.408 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn to be
more in that, it's strong,

00:43:30.408 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:90%
it's mighty, it's clear.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.113 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of somebody
like Artemis, the architect

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:42.253 align:middle line:84%
of Artemis, who was actually
vengeful in her own way.

00:43:42.253 --> 00:43:49.227 align:middle line:84%
She was an archetype that really
brought not only her own space,

00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:52.763 align:middle line:84%
but she was revengeful
to the people who --

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- intruded
on her space.

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:55.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: --
intruded on her space.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Right, so she was
the queen of boundaries.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Exactly.

00:43:59.237 --> 00:44:00.538 align:middle line:90%
So if you want to focus--

00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:01.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So if you want to
learn -- and what and focus.

00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:03.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Focus, tremendous focus.

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:05.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Really, interesting.

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:10.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: It said the
bow and arrow is her symbol.

00:44:10.515 --> 00:44:14.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you were
to say Arianna was one

00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:16.554 align:middle line:84%
and you were the other,
since they're sisters,

00:44:16.554 --> 00:44:17.955 align:middle line:90%
which one would you take?

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:19.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes, well,
Arianna is very much the Athena.

00:44:19.557 --> 00:44:23.427 align:middle line:84%
She creates vision, she
creates with strategy.

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:28.466 align:middle line:84%
Her intellect, the
way she writes books,

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.969 align:middle line:84%
and obviously she has the
demeanor because she is a mother

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:35.072 align:middle line:84%
and she nurtures her
children, her projects.

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:39.243 align:middle line:84%
And I'm much more of the
Persephone archetype.

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:40.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, that's what
we're going to get into next.

00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:41.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes,
we're going to get into.

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:46.484 align:middle line:84%
And Persephone is a
very important archetype

00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:48.486 align:middle line:90%
for the young girls as well.

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:51.889 align:middle line:84%
It's the spirit of youth,
it's the spirit of creativity

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.891 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of
transformation.

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:56.727 align:middle line:84%
And then as she goes
into the underworld--

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:59.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, and what's the
underworld part of that?

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:00.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
The underworld is

00:45:00.398 --> 00:45:04.302 align:middle line:84%
when she marries Hades and
he abducts her and rapes her

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:06.037 align:middle line:84%
and takes her into
the underworld.

00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:10.007 align:middle line:84%
But the myth, why the myth is so
powerful is because all of us,

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
at some point in our lives, have
something that happens in us

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.551 align:middle line:84%
where it's almost like
the chasm, the void,

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:24.255 align:middle line:84%
the separation from
the innocence.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:29.427 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's my parent's
separation, it's a betrayal

00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:31.228 align:middle line:90%
from a friend, it's a loss.

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It happens to everyone.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:33.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: It's a loss.

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:37.735 align:middle line:84%
And in that loss, you
go through your journey,

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:42.607 align:middle line:84%
you're sort of like the
darkness, the isolation,

00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:45.176 align:middle line:84%
the times where you
feel separate,

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:48.412 align:middle line:90%
you feel alone, you feel bereft.

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, the journey
everyone goes through.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And then
out of that, the knowledge

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.953 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom and the
transformation comes.

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:58.456 align:middle line:90%
And then she rises and she goes

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:01.359 align:middle line:84%
up into the Earth
again, and then it's--

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This happens again and
again and again in your life.

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:06.063 align:middle line:84%
It's when you stop
sucking your thumb

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.632 align:middle line:90%
to when you become a woman.

00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:10.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Love
virginity, your menopause,

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:15.773 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually interesting,
because Demeter, her mother

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.842 align:middle line:84%
and Persephone are
called the goddesses

00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:20.578 align:middle line:90%
of seasons, the change.

00:46:20.578 --> 00:46:21.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The change.

00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:22.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: The change.

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:23.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that's Persephone,

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.484 align:middle line:84%
and you said the modern-day
Persephones would be --

00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
these are people that
are goddesses of death

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.322 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth and transformation.

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:34.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes, and
I tell you my favorite one.

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:36.527 align:middle line:90%
It's Alice in Wonderland.

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Alice in Wonderland.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:39.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And I
say Alice in Wonderland

00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:45.936 align:middle line:84%
because it's a magical figure of
transformation, and she changes.

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:50.841 align:middle line:84%
She becomes little and she
goes into this world of magic.

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, that's
absolutely true,

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:57.548 align:middle line:84%
and also you mentioned Madonna
and Cher and Angelina Jolie,

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:84%
all these people who made
these transformations.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: You know,
Angelina Jolie's very much

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:03.387 align:middle line:90%
and Aphrodite, though.

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, I would
agree, yeah.

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:10.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: She's very
much this ideal of beauty

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:14.732 align:middle line:84%
and love and eros and
sensuality and relationships.

00:47:14.732 --> 00:47:16.567 align:middle line:90%
She's a lover.

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:19.236 align:middle line:84%
You see that, even
with her children.

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:20.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Motherhood, yes, yes.

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:22.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: It's a very
different approach of a mother.

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.276 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Demeter mother.

00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:27.111 align:middle line:90%
It's more the Aphrodite mother,

00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:30.081 align:middle line:84%
where the children are
also an extension of you,

00:47:30.081 --> 00:47:33.651 align:middle line:90%
and eros, she's about eros.

00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:37.154 align:middle line:84%
And eros is essential
part of our lives.

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:38.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Eros is--

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Eros
is the child of Aphrodite

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:44.061 align:middle line:90%
and is the erotic love.

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.163 align:middle line:90%
It's the sensual love.

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:52.236 align:middle line:84%
And in that part, I always
say, you don't have to be

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.638 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship
to bring it alive.

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:58.476 align:middle line:84%
You can actually bring it
alive in your everyday life.

00:47:58.476 --> 00:48:02.012 align:middle line:84%
It's everything to do
with the senses, beauty.

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:04.081 align:middle line:90%
Aphrodites, all about beauty.

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And touch.

00:48:05.483 --> 00:48:09.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And touch and
smells and perfumes and food.

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:13.824 align:middle line:84%
The aphrodisiac of life,
enriches our lives.

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:18.195 align:middle line:84%
I always said to women, if you
want to feel like an Aphrodite,

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:20.331 align:middle line:90%
smile from inside out.

00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:21.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That gives
you that essence.

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: That
essence, that confidence

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.035 align:middle line:90%
that you're beautiful.

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:27.638 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this poem about her.

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
She actually wrote it
through me, that said,

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:33.344 align:middle line:90%
all women are born beautiful.

00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that, however,
is their choice.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.216 align:middle line:84%
All women are born
deserving love.

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:42.119 align:middle line:90%
Choosing that is up to them.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:46.457 align:middle line:84%
And she said -- she goes on
and on, and then she says,

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:51.996 align:middle line:84%
I'm in bliss, I live in bliss,
can you see my secret smile?

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:53.764 align:middle line:90%
Why do I smile?

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.166 align:middle line:90%
Whom do I belong to?

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:58.002 align:middle line:90%
I belong to me.

00:48:58.002 --> 00:49:01.772 align:middle line:84%
She's into herself, you know
this phrase, she's not into you.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, Aphrodites,
says, I'm into me.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm into me.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, but
it's a wonderful --

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:11.382 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see the
Greek goddesses

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:15.519 align:middle line:84%
as different personality phases
that you go through in life.

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.822 align:middle line:84%
You can be an Aphrodite,
you can be an Athena.

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:20.024 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the
way you look at it, though.

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:22.993 align:middle line:84%
If you're always embodying
just one archetype or--

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.461 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
No, we change.

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:25.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You can change, okay.

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: It's the same
thing about the five questions,

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:90%
what am I here to learn today?

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.403 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to teach today?

00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:37.074 align:middle line:84%
And they come in to
teach us, the archetypes.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They are born out of us.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah, yes.

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:42.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Out of
the creative imagination.

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:90%
They're ours.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.515 align:middle line:90%
We have them.

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:46.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They're such a
powerful mythology, too.

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:50.554 align:middle line:84%
They've lasted for centuries
and centuries to still teach.

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So Demeter, we have
a picture of Demeter.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Demeter, yes.

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:55.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We talked a
little bit about --

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
The mother of --

00:49:56.594 --> 00:50:00.564 align:middle line:84%
and that's the nurturing
quality, and that's the part

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:04.101 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that
really is the mother.

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:06.103 align:middle line:84%
And whether you have
children or not,

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:07.538 align:middle line:90%
I would say like Oprah Winfrey,

00:50:07.538 --> 00:50:10.474 align:middle line:84%
she does not have children,
but she's the mother.

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:14.378 align:middle line:84%
She's the mother
archetype and Maya Angelou,

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:18.282 align:middle line:84%
and you have the mother in
you, I have the mother in me,

00:50:18.282 --> 00:50:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and we love our children but
we love people in the world.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Many.

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And
we have to nurture.

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:26.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:27.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Because
if we don't nurture,

00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:29.526 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
some part of us dies.

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:34.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: The opposite I find is
that I wind up nurturing so much

00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:37.167 align:middle line:84%
that I do not take
care of myself.

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes.

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:39.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so I'm
overnurturing.

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Well,
that's also it's interesting,

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:46.543 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of women who
are the Demeter have a problem

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:49.613 align:middle line:84%
with being caretakers
of everyone.

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.348 align:middle line:90%
And my mother did that.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:55.052 align:middle line:84%
She started to lose her
boundaries because she started

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.554 align:middle line:84%
to take care of,
nurturing all the time

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.757 align:middle line:90%
and really neglected herself.

00:50:59.757 --> 00:51:00.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So I would
need to call in a little

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:02.293 align:middle line:90%
of the Armetis' energy.

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:09.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Or return
to self that nurturing,

00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:84%
return the love to yourself,
return the kindness to yourself.

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:14.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And take care of me.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Yes, take care of me.

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:18.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: The other
goddess that you talk

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:22.680 align:middle line:84%
about in the book is the goddess
of heart and home, Hestia.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Hestia's the sacred.

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The sacred.

00:51:25.149 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And that's
the part of us that loves

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.253 align:middle line:84%
to meditate and to
pray and to serve,

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's the part
that's really not about us.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.591 align:middle line:90%
She's not about her.

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.293 align:middle line:90%
She's about --

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Hearth and home.

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:39.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And sacred,
the sacred part of life.

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:42.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And the modern-day
-- is Mother Teresa.

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:45.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Yes,
yes, service, and the home.

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:49.873 align:middle line:84%
Hestia women are always about
taking care of their home,

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.308 align:middle line:90%
making it a sanctuary.

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:53.243 align:middle line:90%
And they're homemakers.

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:55.813 align:middle line:84%
I remember going out
shopping with a friend of mine

00:51:55.813 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
who is a Hestia,
and I wanted to go

00:51:58.015 --> 00:52:00.551 align:middle line:84%
to the clothing store,
to the boutique.

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:05.556 align:middle line:84%
And she saw furniture saw
and said, oh, let's go there.

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:08.492 align:middle line:84%
She was, what can I buy for my
home to make it more beautiful?

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:09.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:11.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: And she
was always wearing kind

00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:13.897 align:middle line:90%
of a black dress or something.

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:17.935 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't into her looks or
anteing, she was into her home.

00:52:17.935 --> 00:52:19.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's interesting,
that's really interesting.

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:22.973 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one we're
going to talk about is Hera.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:23.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Hera is marriage

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and relationships
and partnerships.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:28.779 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
not just for marriage,

00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:31.248 align:middle line:84%
but this is about all
sorts of relationships.

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:84%
How do you nurture
your relationships.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you find balance
in relationships.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.155 align:middle line:90%
How do you communicate?

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you are having a
hard time in your relationships,

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:45.462 align:middle line:84%
can you call upon that energy
or study the energy of Hera more

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:48.632 align:middle line:84%
in order to get bonding
back in a relationship?

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: I
don't know if that's true.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.071 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more like
identifying if you have

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:57.608 align:middle line:90%
that archetype in you,

00:52:57.608 --> 00:52:59.743 align:middle line:84%
then marriage is
very, very important.

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Like a woman who's more of
a Hera, she will date a man

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.316 align:middle line:84%
with the thought, is this
the man I'm going to marry?

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:08.886 align:middle line:84%
Aphrodite would be more
is this the man I'm going

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:11.488 align:middle line:84%
to have a good time
with, a love affair?

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:14.324 align:middle line:84%
So it's marriage
versus love affairs.

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:16.727 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can get
both, it's great.

00:53:16.727 --> 00:53:18.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Different
times, it's perfect, yeah.

00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:19.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos:
Different times, you know.

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:24.034 align:middle line:84%
But it's more awareness of
what hat are we wearing,

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:27.204 align:middle line:90%
what archetype we come under.

00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:29.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So combining all
of the goddess information

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:31.241 align:middle line:90%
and the unbinding your heart,

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:33.644 align:middle line:84%
what is the final
overall message

00:53:33.644 --> 00:53:35.979 align:middle line:90%
that you want to tell people?

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: You
know, there is a quote

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:39.616 align:middle line:84%
that I really love that
I want to share with you,

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:43.487 align:middle line:84%
which is my heart is at
peace, knowing that that

00:53:43.487 --> 00:53:46.824 align:middle line:90%
that is mine will never miss me.

00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:52.596 align:middle line:84%
And that that misses me was
never meant for me at all.

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:57.101 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we can come
into the presence of our heart

00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:01.605 align:middle line:84%
and come present to know
that there is a real place

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:06.243 align:middle line:84%
where the presence of our heart
is real, which is the sharing

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:11.949 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, the authenticity,
the purity of who we are,

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:16.954 align:middle line:84%
and that nothing we
misses that's meant for us,

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:21.158 align:middle line:84%
then we don't feel the sense of
lack and we can literally feel

00:54:21.158 --> 00:54:23.227 align:middle line:90%
at home with ourselves.

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:24.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's beautiful, yes.

00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:25.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Coming home

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.831 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves is what I
really think we all want.

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, we do.

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: May I read
this little poem for you?

00:54:30.868 --> 00:54:34.571 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Palace of My Heart."

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:39.843 align:middle line:84%
You keep knocking at my door,
but I don't live here anymore.

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:42.179 align:middle line:90%
My old house is demolished.

00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:47.251 align:middle line:84%
I left. I left where I live,
and you cannot find me.

00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:48.785 align:middle line:90%
Don't look for me.

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:51.989 align:middle line:90%
I have no visitors of your kind.

00:54:51.989 --> 00:54:55.225 align:middle line:90%
My house is lit with love.

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:58.695 align:middle line:84%
If you come close,
it will engulf you

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:01.965 align:middle line:84%
and you will disappear
and you won't like that.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:05.269 align:middle line:84%
In my house there
is no room for you.

00:55:05.269 --> 00:55:09.806 align:middle line:84%
The rooms are filled with joy,
and you will not like that.

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.642 align:middle line:90%
Don't keep knocking at my door.

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:13.143 align:middle line:90%
I have moved.

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.779 align:middle line:90%
You find me there anymore.

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:19.183 align:middle line:84%
I have moved into the
palace of my heart.

00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:19.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That is beautiful.

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.618 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful way to end.

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.421 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
your warmth and your love

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:27.591 align:middle line:84%
and your wisdom and
your mother's wisdom.

00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:28.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Thank you.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Thank you for
sharing all of it with us.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.628 align:middle line:84%
>> Stassinopoulos: Thank you
for sharing it and allowing me

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.932 align:middle line:84%
to come bring my heart
into your beautiful show

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:36.934 align:middle line:90%
and your beautiful smile.

00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:38.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you
are an inspiration.

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Stassinopoulos: Thank you.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to conversing
more with all the viewers.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, absolutely.

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.109 align:middle line:84%
