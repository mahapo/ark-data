[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.490 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations,"

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.840 align:middle line:10%
and our topic for the series
that we're taping here

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.880 align:middle line:10%
at the Celebrate
Your Life Conference

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
is to explore the
meaning of I am.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And joining me to talk
about this and so much more

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is a man who's been a
huge influence in my life

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and my healing process,
Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Joe is an expert in
the role of the function

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain
and how it creates

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:10%
a bridge between
true human potential,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:10%
and also the latest in
the scientific theories

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:10%
of neuroplasticity.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Hi, Lisa.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be with you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.833 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm always
excited that you're here.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So this meaning, this
"I am" has kind of

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
taken on a wonderful meaning
here throughout the series.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
What is your experience
of the "I am"?

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a specific
experience of that?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.615 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Are
you talking about

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:03.315 align:middle line:84%
the "I am" in terms
of the universal "I

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
am" or the "I am" in terms
of you and I as an "I am",

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%
or both?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, whatever
it means to you.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I
think that thoughts

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:10%
are the language of
the brain and feelings

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
are the language of the body.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:10%
And how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:10%
So if you're thinking
insecure thoughts,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:10%
you're going to turn on a
set of circuits in your brain

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:10%
that produces a level of mind,
and another part of the brain

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:10%
is going to make a chemical for
you to begin to feel insecure.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
insecure, your brain

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
is monitoring its
internal state,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
you are going to think
more corresponding thoughts

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
equal to how you feel, which
is going to generate more

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
chemicals to feel
insecure, and then thinking

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:90%
more insecure thoughts.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And that cycle of thinking
and feeling and feeling

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, creating
that state of being,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
causes the person to
say, I am insecure.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you
say I am anything,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
you are commanding the
present moment into a destiny.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So then the antithesis
is also true.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're grateful and
you're loving life,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
you are going to think
corresponding thoughts

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:84%
equal to that
emotional state, which

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is going to make a
different factory

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
or blend of chemicals for you
to feel more gracious and more

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
kind, more giving,
which is going

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to generate more thoughts.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to create
a different state of being.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So the trouble I
think we have is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that the process of thinking
and feeling and feeling

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and thinking over time
conditions the body

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to subconsciously
become the mind.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Now once the body
becomes the mind,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
the servant is now the master.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the program begins
to become activated,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and now people slip
into unconscious states.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to
change, then-- and this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is the problem that I
have with affirmations.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
When you're having
an affirmation,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
an affirmation is,
you're affirming

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
your I am, your state of being.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying,
I am abundant,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
but you're feeling
lack, I am successful,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but you're feeling
unworthy, that's

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:90%
mind and body in opposition.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So then, when a
person then knows

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
how to regulate and change
their internal states

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and they move into a
new state of being.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
When they're in
that state of being,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
the side effect of being
in that state of being is,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I am wealthy.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
You're actually affirming
what you already are.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's not the words.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.557 align:middle line:90%
It's the state of being.

00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the words I
am won't change anything,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
if you say I am abundant.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel into that and
experience that viscerally,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.912 align:middle line:84%
that changes the chemistry
from the brain to the body.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.661 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it another way.

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
You will only accept, believe,
and surrender to the thoughts

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
equal to your emotional state.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And you will not accept
belief and surrender

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to any thoughts that are not
equal to your emotional state.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, a person
goes to a doctor's office.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The doctor says,
OK, you're diagnosed

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
with MS or lupus or cancer.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The moment the person
gets the diagnosis,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
they're either going to
feel sadness or fear.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Now the moment they
start feeling fear,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
they are going to think
corresponding thoughts

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:90%
equal to that emotional state.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So now those thoughts will
slip by their analytical mind,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:84%
program their autonomic
nervous system

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
to make more chemicals
equal to that state.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So then they can think
positively all they want.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
They could say, I'm going
to heal this condition.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
But if they're feeling fear--

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And cortisol's
still releasing.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The chemistry
with the brain and body

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:90%
are at odds, right?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So then if you get
a person, then,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
to change their emotional
state and open their heart,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and then begin to feel empowered
or invincible or unlimited,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
then they will begin to
accept, believe, and surrender

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to that emotional state,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and they'll program their
automatic nervous system

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to make a new
pharmacy of chemicals

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
to match that state of being.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is why
affirmations don't work,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
because they never get
past the analytical mind.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, the person will
say, I am wealthy, I am love,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.857 align:middle line:90%
I am happy.

00:05:12.857 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't addressed
the part of them that's

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.689 align:middle line:90%
not in alignment with that.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you could say,
I am wealthy, but stare

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
at the bank account that
has a bunch of zeros on it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that is a break
in your truth with yourself,

00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:90%
your authenticity with yourself.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now the I
am that lives within us,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that invisible intelligence
that's giving life,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:90%
has a presence.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It's an awareness.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a consciousness.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness, as an
awareness, is paying attention.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of awareness.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So it is observing
our states of being,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's always
endorsing who we are.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you're really
happy being unhappy

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and you are a victim to your
life, it honors free will

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and it will endorse the
very chemicals, and actually

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the very reality, you experience
equal to that state of being.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you come out of
your resting state-- and it

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
requires coming out
of your resting state.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
observer is omnipotent.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It's omnipresent.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't move.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just constant.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a loving intelligence
and it's intelligent love.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Our attention is all
over the place, you know,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's saying, tell
me what you want.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a minute,
just line up with me here.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you get present
with it and you turn inward,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and when your will
matches its will,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and when your mind
matches its mind,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and when your love for life
matches its love for life

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're present
with it, and now you

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
are turning inward to it, and
you're not saying, I want,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I need, I hope, I wish,
that's based in polarity.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%
You're saying I am.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I am unlimited, I am
empowered, I am invincible.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you really feel it
and there is that alignment

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.635 align:middle line:84%
and it says, OK, I
am going, the I am

00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to endorse
your I am because you

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:90%
are an extension of my mind.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.007 align:middle line:84%
And I'll begin to change
the very neurocircuitry,

00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the neurochemistry,
the very kinetics,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and even the expression of
your life equal to that.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you say, I
am deserving of that raise.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I am capable of
that new job, that

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
starts to align yourself
with the finances

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:90%
that you are wanting.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: As long as your mind
and body are working together.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of the I am.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So just like you know when
someone is present with you

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
because they're
paying attention,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
this intelligence requires
the same degree of attention.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I get it.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So how, then, does the
placebo work, then?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.521 align:middle line:84%
Your book, "You
Are the Placebo."

00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, in every
single case of the placebo,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
the placebo's based
on three things.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Number one is conditioning.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
You give someone a
pill, and it's blue,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and blue pills work
better than red pills,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and it has a certain drug in it.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And you take that drug and it
changes some internal state,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
it reduces pain or it
takes away a symptom.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.384 align:middle line:84%
And then you take it again,
and then you take it again,

00:08:10.384 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:90%
and you take it again.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later, you can
actually replace that blue pill

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
with just a blue pill with sugar
in it, and the person takes it,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and by conditioning,
association,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
they begin to make the very
chemicals based on the past, so

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:90%
stimulus response.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So we could say,
then, conditioning

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%
is based on the past.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Now expectation is the second
element of the placebo, which

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
means expectation, then, is
when you're told something

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
expect an outcome.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And your selecting that pill
represents a new potential

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:90%
in the quantum field.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And a certain percentage
of those people

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
accept, believe, and
surrender to the idea

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and begin to emotionally
embrace the outcome.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine
that clear intention

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, you're moving

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:90%
into a new state of being.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So now as an
example, as you begin

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to anticipate that
occurring, your body

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is actually living in
that future reality

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
in the present
moment, and your body

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.697 align:middle line:84%
begins to make the very
chemicals to endorse

00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:90%
that state of being.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Now who's doing the
fabrication of the chemicals?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
The I am within us,
because it's always

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:90%
endorsing who we're being.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So if conditioning
is based on the past,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
then expectation is
based on the future.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
The third thing is
assigning meaning to things.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
If a doctor says, oh,
this pill will actually

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
increase serotonin receptors,
and you have the pictures,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and people look at it and
they start to think about it.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they take the pill,
they assign meaning to it.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And turns out you can
give someone a sugar pill,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and they could be told that
it's an antidepressant.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And 81% of those people who will
get better by thought alone.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.610 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the pill
that did the healing.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually they were making
their own antidepressants

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
in that second.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
can literally take

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.911 align:middle line:84%
a bottle of antidepressants,
put half sugar pills

00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
in there and half
the actual drug,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
take them, and not
experience the withdrawals

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors say
you will experience

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.337 align:middle line:90%
if you don't take it.

00:10:07.337 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just
say it another way.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Four out of five people
who are taking a pill that

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
has nothing in it
that are told they're

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
taking an antidepressant,
four out of those five people

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
will respond as well as people
who are taking antidepressants.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And many of those
people will actually

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
have functional
brain scans to show

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%
that their brain has improved.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
not just in their mind.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.316 align:middle line:90%
It's in their brain.

00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're making their
own antidepressants.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.398 align:middle line:84%
So how does that work in
terms of the state of being?

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, you combine that clear
intention-- getting clear

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that I could get
well from this--

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
you start feeling an elevated
emotion like inspiration or joy

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.306 align:middle line:90%
or gratitude.

00:10:48.306 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
You just moved from
living in your past

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
to living in a new future.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you move into
that state of being,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.805 align:middle line:84%
that intelligence that's
giving you life, the I am,

00:10:56.805 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is going to organize
your chemistry

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:90%
to reflect who you're being.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look
here at Dr. Joe talking

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
about "You Are the Placebo."

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.174 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: My name
is Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take a moment to
introduce you to my new book,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
"You Are the Placebo--
Making Your Mind Matter."

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I loved writing
this book because it

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:84%
was an opportunity for me
to help people understand

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that they have within
their reach all

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the biological and
neurological machinery

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to produce greater levels
of health in their body

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and produce some pretty
astounding changes

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:90%
The book is about you.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about an
opportunity for you

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand the importance of
changing your health by thought

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
placebo is about.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Why is that you can
give a person a sugar

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
pill, a saline injection,
or perform a fake surgery

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and a certain percentage
of those people

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
actually have a greater
effects in healing

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
than the people who
actually got the real drug,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:90%
got the real surgery?

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
There must be some
element of mind involved.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I wrote the book.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I take people on a
journey in this book,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
with some really
interesting stories

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of how people were healed by
thought alone, how they were

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
believing that they were
taking a real medication,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and in fact they were
taking a placebo.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And the brain
changed to a degree

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that it looked like they had
been taking the real drug.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when that
person accepted, believed,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and surrendered to the
condition without any analysis,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
they began to program
their subconscious

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:84%
mind, or their autonomic
nervous system.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And their body, through its
own pharmacy of chemicals,

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
produced the same response
as if they had taken the drug

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
or had the surgery or
received some type of therapy.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
can you teach people

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
how to utilize the
placebo response?

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And instead of putting
their belief in something

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:84%
that's inert and known
to them, can they

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
begin to select a
new possible reality

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally embrace
it to such a degree

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that they begin to
condition their body

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
into a new state of being, and
their autonomic nervous system

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
begins to make their
own blend of chemicals

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that causes the body
to literally respond

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to a new mind.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is yes.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 25
years we've been

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
teaching people around the
world that they are the placebo.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We have demystified
some of the principles

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
so that they understand how
to apply it in certain ways

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
so they can begin to
experience the benefits.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll show you and
introduce you to people

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
in the book in our
workshops-- some of them

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that had rare genetic
disorders that science

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
had no solution for-- and
they healed themselves

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:90%
by thought alone.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
We have scientific
evidence in the book,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
brain scans to show that those
people that actually made

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
the significant
changes, that there

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
were permanent changes that took
place in their brain as well.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We'll also end the book with
a nice exercise or meditation

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
so you can begin
to understand how

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to apply the principles
so that you can

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:90%
begin to be your own placebo.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy it.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is quite
astounding to see

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that people have actually
healed themselves

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%
from irreversible illnesses.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen this again
and again in your conferences

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
People all the time
are reversing disease.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go back to the
anti-depressant question.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.919 align:middle line:84%
So if you have--
the doctors say,

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
if go off your
antidepressants you're

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
withdrawal period.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you avoid that if you
are only taking a placebo?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, if
you're taking a placebo,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
percentage of people that

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:90%
will experience the nocebo.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They'll experience the side
effects of the very medication

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
they think they're taking
because some people are

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
optimists, some
people are pessimists.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And so a certain
percentage of people

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.972 align:middle line:84%
will experience the side effects
of dizziness and nausea and--

00:14:56.972 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even if they're
taking a placebo.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Even though
they're taking a placebo.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
powerful the mind is.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.688 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:15:01.688 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So there are some very
strong chemical correlations

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
between withdrawals
of certain medications

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that have a little bit more
of an addictive tendency.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.277 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:15:13.277 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
studies around this?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.568 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
quite a few studies.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that when
a person is experiencing,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.486 align:middle line:84%
say, anxiety, and
they're taking something

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to reduce their anxiety, or they
have depression and are taking

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
something to stimulate
their depression,

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
they're believing that
something outside of them

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is going to change
their internal state.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%
In many cases, it does.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So then when they're
no longer taking it,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
they're also experiencing
the withdrawal

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of the anticipation of taking
the very thing that they think

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:90%
that's helping them as well.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's a margin of grayness
that isn't so black and white.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And we know this to be the
case because, as an example,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
you can tell a
person who is going

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
for their first
chemotherapy treatment,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:84%
you can tell them that
chemotherapy is going to make

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
them nauseous and vomit.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
In 40% to 50% of those
people, on their drive

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
over to their first
chemotherapy treatment,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
will experience nausea
before the treatment.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So I always say, if
50% of those people

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
can get nauseous on their drive
to their first chemotherapy

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
treatment, 50% of the
people in the world

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
can get well on
their drive to work

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:84%
in anticipation of something
wonderful happening.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.363 align:middle line:90%
It's the same exact phenomena.

00:16:33.363 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The same
relationship between what

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:84%
the brain tells the body and
the body tells the brain.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.981 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exact same thing.

00:16:41.981 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's this great video that
you have on your website, which

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
really made such an
impact in my life

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see these
neurons wiring together

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.147 align:middle line:90%
and firing together.

00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I've
heard you say so many times.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.047 align:middle line:84%
But to physically
see it is impressive.

00:16:56.047 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how you
get a camera in the brain

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at
something like this.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
This video shows how we
truly-- when we change a habit

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and we break the habit
of being ourselves

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
and create a new way
of doing something,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that the neurons literally fire
together and wire together.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
How many times do you have
to do this in order for this

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:90%
to happen?

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.009 align:middle line:84%
For it to actually
create a bundle?

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:21.466 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You
like this question.

00:17:21.466 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, first of
all we're looking at something

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
called plasticity.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So many people
think the brain is

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
fixed, like neurons
are like leafless oak

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
trees in the winter
and they're static.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, first of
all, is the consistency

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of a soft boiled egg.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It's 78% water.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like soft butter.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much water,
and the water actually

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:90%
facilitates electrical charges.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So then as you interact
with your environment,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
when you think differently, when
you make a different choice,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
when you behave differently,
when you have a new experience,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
when you feel differently,
they have biological effects

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that causes those neurons to
literally repattern themselves.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
So you learn something new.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize Laureate
Kandel, in the year 2000,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.094 align:middle line:84%
found that when people learn
one bit of information,

00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
they double the number of
connections in their brain

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
from 1,300 connections
to 2,600 connections.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't review
that information,

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't revisit it,
if they didn't rehearse it

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in their mind, those
circuits were pruned apart

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:90%
within hours or days.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So if learning is making
new synaptic connections,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
then remembering is
maintaining and sustaining

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:90%
those connections.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
ingredient that causes

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:90%
those neurons to stick more?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Attention is one of them.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Repetition.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Repetition
is the other.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when a person begins to
repeat something like a phone

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
number, or a line in
a song, or they're

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
meeting someone
for the first time

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and they have to pay
attention to their name,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
if they're not present
and they're not

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
paying attention, of
course those circuits

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:90%
never actually glue together.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.089 align:middle line:84%
But if the person produces
an emotional response where

00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
you shake their hand and they
give you a hug and a kiss

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and they say, I know
your mother because I

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.314 align:middle line:90%
went to school with her.

00:19:21.314 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.146 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: In the moment,
you just see this person,

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and you feel differently
inside of you.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
differently inside of you,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to pay
attention more to whatever's

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:90%
causing it outside of you.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And that event in and of
itself is called a memory.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So the more highly
charged emotional

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:84%
experiences we have that take
us out of our resting state

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
causes us to pay attention more
to our external environment.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think of 9/11.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Every single American
in the United States

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
can tell you exactly where
they were, who they were with,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.361 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing that
time of day if they were awake.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And we could say that
everything that they

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
were seeing and hearing
changed their internal state.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The moment they felt
differently, they woke up

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and they looked to
see what caused it,

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and it was that event.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So then they look
around them and they

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
correlate their changes with
everything in that moment.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So then the key,
then, it is if we

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to truly make
longstanding connections

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, the more
passionate we are,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the more we can feel deeply, the
more that we can assign meaning

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to what we're doing in the
midst of that elevated emotion,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause us to
come out of our resting state.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And the internal
experience that we're

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
having becomes a
long-term memory.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:90%
And now the deal is sealed.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's-- for 9/11
or really traumatic stressful

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
events, yes, you've explained to
me that it digs a deeper groove

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and those chemicals
cause those memories to last

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
longer.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.852 align:middle line:84%
But yet the birthdays
and the celebrations

00:20:48.852 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and those things, we
tend to forget them.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same chemistry.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.796 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Wow, this
is a great conversation,

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because we were laughing
about this the other day.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
have 10 great things

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:90%
happen to you in one day.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.237 align:middle line:84%
You can have one
bad thing happen.

00:21:05.237 --> 00:21:06.445 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is up with that?

00:21:06.445 --> 00:21:09.234 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And you will always
remember the one bad thing,

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and you'll forget
the good things.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being is because
we're programmed for survival.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.512 align:middle line:84%
In survival, the
one bad thing that

00:21:15.512 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
happens you've got
to pay attention

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:90%
to because you're going to

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Have to anticipate, if
it happens again, how

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:90%
you're going to deal with it.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So we put a lot of our attention
on those survival things,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:90%
and we're wired for survival.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So then in order to truly
make substantial changes, not

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
by forcing an outcome or
controlling an outcome,

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
overly analyzing an
outcome, but to really

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
change in the new
model of science

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
with a clear intention
and elevated emotion,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to lay
down the very thing we used

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
our whole life to get
what we want for something

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:90%
greater to occur.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.545 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
easy to talk about,

00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little
more difficult to do.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
I'm thinking, when

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
are we going to be over
this survival thing?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But you said you have a
different relationship

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:90%
with death.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I as well, because I went
through that transition

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
experience, that
near death, they

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
call it, experience
to understand

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
what that may be like,
that potential for me,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
is that that experience of
the other side is oneness,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is peace, is
simplicity, is beauty.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I have that relationship
because of my experience.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You have that relationship
because of your experience.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:90%
I see you in the hallways.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't listen
to people complain.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You say, if you don't love
it you're not going to do it.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
If you love your life too much
to do things that you don't

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:90%
want to do-- I hear it all.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.597 align:middle line:90%
I record it all, Joe.

00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I mean,
this is a healthy conversation

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.344 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You changed
your perspective.

00:22:41.344 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I have to.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
ultimate truth is oneness,

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that everything else is
a diminishing of that.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand
biologically

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
where oneness occurs, it occurs
right here in the heart center.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And what if you took 10
minutes out of your day,

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.582 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes out of your
day, to rest your attention

00:23:00.582 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
in that center-- where
you place your attention

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
is where you place your
energy-- to cultivate

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
an elevated emotion
like gratitude or joy

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
or the joy for existence or
the love of life or compassion,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and you felt it deeply.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that the moment
energy moves into your heart,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.222 align:middle line:84%
the field around your body
expands to nine meters wide?

00:23:21.222 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:84%
When you're living in
survival and you're

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
living in fear and anxiety
and anger and hostility

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and violence and
sadness and guilt,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
you're drawing from
this invisible field

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're turning
it into chemistry.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And the field around
your body shrinks.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you're more matter
and less energy.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You're particle and less weight,
and you don't have any energy

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to actually form long-term
building projects like growth

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and repair, or to create
anything you want in your life.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Turns out the heart
has a magnetic field.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's like dropping
a pebble in the water.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you can sustain
that emotional state,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
now you are dropping
pebble after pebble

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's sending ripples out.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The more profound you feel, the
more passionate, more enriched

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
you feel, the bigger the stone
you're dropping in the water,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:90%
the bigger the wave.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Now all frequency, all
energy carries information.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's the magnetic charge.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So what is the information?

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the intention?

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the mind now.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So then you send an
intention on that wave.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You have a clear intention,
and that information

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is being carried on
that frequency wave.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now you're broadcasting an
electromagnetic signature

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:90%
into the field.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you're
living in survival,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
you're always trying to control
the outcome, force the outcome,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.034 align:middle line:90%
predict the outcome.

00:24:38.034 --> 00:24:39.908 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you're in your own way,

00:24:39.908 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
because you're matter
trying to influence matter.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to take a
certain amount of time.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We call that
three-dimensional creation.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Fifth-dimensional
creation is the opposite.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
not going anywhere.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You are the vortex that's
calling the experience to you.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So then when you combine
that clear intention

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, when there's

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational match
between your energy

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and that potential
in the quantum field,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.446 align:middle line:84%
it's like taking a tuning fork
and hitting the tuning fork,

00:25:07.446 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and you another
one, and that one

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
is going to produce
the same harmonic.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Now there's a vibrational match.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you can
sustain that energy,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
or better yet, the faster
the frequency, the more

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
elevated the emotion, the
faster in time it happens.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And you teach people how to do
that properly, they would never

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:90%
try to control the outcome.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
They trust in the outcome
because this is the center

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:90%
where you trust the unknown.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So now you're laying
down the very thing

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that you've done because
you don't feel separate

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:90%
from possibility.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
You're not a materialist
defining reality

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
with your senses,
which occurs primarily

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:90%
from the hormones of stress.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the
opposite is happening.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is open and you feel
connected to something greater.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.959 align:middle line:84%
And it's none of your business
when it's going to happen

00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or how it's going to
happen, because if you

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
can predict when
it's going to happen

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.483 align:middle line:84%
and how it's going to
happen, it's not an unknown.

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:02.392 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Back to matter.

00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And the chemicals
that release when

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:84%
you're in that state
of that coherence

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.755 align:middle line:84%
are the growth hormones,
the serotonin, the--

00:26:10.755 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, there's
1,300 different chemicals

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:84%
that are released that stimulate
your immune system, that

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
cause regeneration and
repair in the body.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And those 1,300 chemicals
are profound chemicals

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.755 align:middle line:84%
that actually lengthen
telomeres as well.

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Better than
any antidepressant.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.796 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And that's the
greatest pharmacy in the world.

00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So now it turns out that 10
minutes of gratitude a day

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:84%
releases a chemical
called immunoglobulin

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
A, the primary defense
against bacteria and viruses.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes of anger or
impatience or frustration

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:84%
or fear turns on 1,200
different chemicals

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that causes the body
to mobilize energy

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and suppresses
the immune system.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.734 align:middle line:90%
So then--

00:26:49.734 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In 10 minutes.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.733 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: In 10 minutes.

00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So then the person who is
feeling gratitude and those

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
elevated emotions
in the morning,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and you check their blood
values of IgA, immunoglobulin A,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day,
it's still elevated.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%
In other words, it lasts.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You just took the shot,
you took the flu shot,

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to protect you
against bacteria and viruses.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the truth.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Germs don't make you sick.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
We make ourselves sick.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a company where
everybody's getting infected

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.035 align:middle line:84%
and they're all sick at the
same time, it's not the bug.

00:27:21.035 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
It's they're all stressed,
and they're all susceptible.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:84%
They're called
opportunistic bacteria

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're waiting
for an opportunity

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to proliferate if your
immune system is compromised.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:84%
People need to know
the truth about this

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're
programmed into believing

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:90%
that germs make them sick.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's no germ out
there with your name on it

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.230 align:middle line:90%
that's waiting to attack you.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We have just as many
microorganisms in our body

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:90%
as we have cells.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the way in which
we manage our internal states.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
not the cold weather

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
or the change of climate or
anything that makes you sick.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
It's your immune
system being suppressed

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.554 align:middle line:84%
by your emotional state that
opens up the door for it.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Ah,
you're getting it.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm a student.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I love this video
because it's another great way

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to learn, where Dr. Joe's
talking about our three brains.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Now we
have three brains

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:10%
that allow us to go from
thinking to doing to being.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Each brain is its own
individual biocomputer

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
with its own anatomy and own
circuitry, its own physiology

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and chemistry.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
They even have their own history
as well as their own sense

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.160 align:middle line:90%
of time and space.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Now the first brain,
the neocortex,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
it's the newest
brain in evolution.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's that
walnut-shaped structure

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that sits on the outside
with all of its folds

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and valleys in yellow there.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the newest, the most
evolved and highly specialized

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:90%
in human beings.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Right under the neocortex
is called the limbic brain,

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:84%
the chemical brain,
the emotional brain,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
or the mammalian brain.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's about the size
of a lemon, and it's

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
responsible for regulating
internal chemical order.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Right in the back of the
brain stem there in red

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is called the cerebellum,
the reptilian brain.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the oldest
brain in evolution.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the seat of the
subconscious mind.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Now your brain is made up of
about 100 billion neurons.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:84%
If you took 100
billion sheets of paper

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and stacked them on
top of each other,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:90%
it would be 5,000 miles high.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the distance from
Los Angeles to London.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Now nerve cells possess
the unique ability

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to store and communicate
information between each other.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So your neocortex,
your thinking brain,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is the seat of your
conscious awareness.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to me right
now with your neocortex.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And what the neocortex loves
to do is to gather information.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
learn something new,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.040 align:middle line:84%
you make a new
synaptic connection

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:90%
in your thinking brain.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what learning is.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Learning is forging
new connections.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
learn something new

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:90%
your brain physically changes.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So you read a book on
how to ride a bicycle.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:10%
You read a book on how
to build a dog house.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:84%
You read a book on how
to dance the salsa,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:84%
how to cook French cuisine,
how to become successful,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:90%
how to be a better parent.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And your brain literally
upscales its hardware

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:90%
to reflect a new level of mind.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:29.340 align:middle line:84%
The principle in neuroscience
says this-- nerve cells

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that fire together
wire together.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
learn new information,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:84%
you biologically
wire that information

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.110 align:middle line:90%
into your cerebral architecture.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So if learning is making
new synaptic connections,

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:84%
then remembering is
maintaining and sustaining

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:90%
those connections.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And just like any relationship,
the more you communicate,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:90%
the more bonded you become.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And neurons are
exactly the same way.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now once these neurons begin
to fire and wire together,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:84%
they actually form networks,
what neuroscientists

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:90%
call neural networks.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now neural networks
are just gangs

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of neurons that have
fired and wired together

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to form a community of
neurosynaptic connections.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be related to an
idea, a concept, a memory,

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
experience, a skill or
behavior, or an action.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But these networks actually have
an electrochemical component.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to see
mind in action, watch this.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a thought, right there.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So you generate more
electrical impulses

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in your brain in one day
than all the cell phones

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:90%
on the planet put together.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the neuroscientific
definition of mind

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:90%
is mind is the brain in action.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Mind is the brain at work.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Mind is what the brain does.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And because we have 100 billion
neurons seamlessly pieced

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
together, we can
make the brain fire

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
in different sequences,
different patterns,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and different combinations.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And whenever we make the
brain work differently,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:10%
we're changing our mind.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have these three
brains, and they're constantly

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.779 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So let's
make it really simple.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:90%
You learn a bit of information.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:84%
That information actually
causes neurons to assemble

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:90%
and to connect new connections.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what learning is.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:90%
We said that.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's stored
in your thinking,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
theoretical, philosophical,
analytical neocortex.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:84%
If you take that information
and you get your body involved,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it
and you personalize

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:84%
it or you demonstrate
it, it means

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to modify your
behaviors in some way

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and do something differently
and initiate that knowledge.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it properly,
you have a new experience.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
The experience, then, enriches
the circuits in your brain

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.164 align:middle line:84%
that you understood
philosophically.

00:32:52.164 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But then another
part of the brain

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.680 align:middle line:84%
called the chemical brain
or the emotional brain

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:84%
or the limbic brain
makes a chemical for you

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:90%
to feel differently.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you feel
compassion, or the moment

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:84%
you feel like a patient
parent, or the moment

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
you feel like a great
leader because you read

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the book on any one
of those things,

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
the moment you
feel that emotion,

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching
your body chemically

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand what your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So we can say knowledge is
for the mind and experience is

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment you
are embodying knowledge.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The word is becoming
flesh, and you're

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
signaling new genes in new ways
because it's a new experience.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And the chemical reaction
from the environment

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:90%
is selecting new.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Genes

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're able to reproduce that
experience over and over again,

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
the process of
re-experiencing it

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is neurologically and
chemically conditioning

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
your brain and body to
work together as one mind.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've done
something so many times

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:84%
your body knows how to do
it as well as your mind,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.110 align:middle line:90%
now you're in a state of being.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Now it's innate in you.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.823 align:middle line:84%
You've done it so many times you
don't have to think about it.

00:33:58.823 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It's almost subconscious.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So our job, then, is
the go from philosopher

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to initiate to master, from
thinking to doing to being.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:84%
The mind, the body, the
soul, from knowledge

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to experience to wisdom.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the biological
and neurological machinery

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So the problem, I think,
that we have in our life

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
is we reach a
certain point where

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
we stop evolving into
that state of being,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and we get caught up in
self-conscious beliefs

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and perceptions about
the way we think

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.181 align:middle line:84%
reality is based
on how we've had so

00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:32.389 align:middle line:90%
many experiences in our life.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:33.299 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sameness.

00:34:33.299 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:90%
The sameness.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So
then people make up

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.469 align:middle line:84%
things about reality because
of their past experiences.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And all beliefs are
subconscious states of being.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs we have
about things actually

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
could work for us or against
us depending on how we're

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.741 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously programmed.

00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:10%
You're subconsciously
programmed to think

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.709 align:middle line:10%
that sugar is bad for you.

00:34:50.709 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they've done experiments
where they take people

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:10%
and they measure
their immune response,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.890 align:middle line:10%
and they tell them
chocolate is good for them

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:10%
and they tell them
chocolate is bad for them.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:10%
People who think that
chocolate's bad for them,

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:10%
their immune system is
way more compromised

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:10%
than the person who's eating
chocolate and enjoying it

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.534 align:middle line:10%
and eventually
your immune system

00:35:04.534 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:10%
stimulated so I mean diet
is a lot like religion.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be careful
when you talk about it.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.193 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, not so much.

00:35:10.193 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can really
truly change your mind

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:84%
about what you're eating, and
your body will fall in line.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.283 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I
mean, if you think

00:35:17.283 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
about the preacher in the deep
south of the United States

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.650 align:middle line:84%
who moves into a state of
religious ecstasy and drinks

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:84%
strychnine and has no
biological effects,

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.819 align:middle line:84%
he's certainly in a
different state of being.

00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the extreme.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: He's
not saying, oh geez,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I'm going
to get poisoned today.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:10%
He's changed his
internal state, and it's

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:10%
causing his body to be
immune to the conditions

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:10%
in his environment.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's how
powerful our minds are,

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:10%
and that's what your
work talks about,

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.299 align:middle line:10%
and that's what I
love so much, is

00:35:44.299 --> 00:35:46.090 align:middle line:10%
the power of our mind
to change our bodies,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:10%
and that body's ability to
change our mind as well.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And it may take
more than one shot at it.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
We have some people
in our work that

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:84%
have healed themselves of
very serious health conditions

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that have taken four years
or three years to do it,

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
because it took them five years
to create the condition because

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of a stressed-out
lifestyle and poor choices.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
that in order

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to turn the battleship
around-- even placebo studies.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Placebo studies sometimes
are six or eight weeks long.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The depression
studies, the person's

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:84%
taking a placebo
for six or eight

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:middle line:84%
weeks to remind themselves
of the new state of being.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.944 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need the sugar
pill or the saline injection

00:36:24.944 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to move into a new
state of being.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
You can combine
a clear intention

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated emotion and
change your very physiology.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But, you're knocking
on the genetic door

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and it may take a
little bit of time

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to continuously
knock on that door

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.770 align:middle line:90%
before you program the gene.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Other people are able to do it
in a very short amount of time.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So the key is that we just
have to be persistent with it,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and we start to
see some changes.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can set
that time of that gratitude

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the practices
as if it is a pill, a mind

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
pill, where you've got a
time capsule where you really

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
are concentrating and
feeling and experiencing

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that emotion in order to change
the chemistry in the brain.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Once you understand
the science of how it's done,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and you understand
the what and the why,

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.580 align:middle line:90%
the how becomes easier.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:11.659 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're so
responsible for doing

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.241 align:middle line:90%
for so many people.

00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:15.635 align:middle line:90%
