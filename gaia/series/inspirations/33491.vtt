host of Gaiam Inspirations.

So what is an ex-emergency
medicine doctor have to say

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.559 align:middle line:90%
about the exploration

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.596 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
self-realization?

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, a lot.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.134 align:middle line:84%
The age of 30, my guess, Richard
Moss had a transformative

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:37.404 align:middle line:84%
realization that transformed his
life from practicing medicine

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.908 align:middle line:84%
to transmitting healing
energy to others

going to be an amazing interview

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
because in your presence
there is a certain vibration

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.397 align:middle line:84%
that is increasing just
by sitting next to you.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.832 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.001 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Moss: That's what
awakened in me when I was 30.

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:12.473 align:middle line:84%
It's-- You know, people talk
about cosmic consciousness.

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:13.474 align:middle line:90%
There's different words for it.

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:16.043 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know it existed.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.112 align:middle line:84%
It was a very rough
ride for awhile.

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Moss: But when
you read Walt Whitman

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:25.119 align:middle line:84%
and you read the "Song of
Myself" and his "Leaves

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.022 align:middle line:84%
of Grass", when you read the
book "Cosmic Consciousness",

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a puberty,
but it's a spiritual puberty

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.861 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't take
away who you were.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.565 align:middle line:84%
It's as if suddenly like
when we have puberty

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:84%
and our body has changed,
this is tremendous, new--

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Energy.

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.274 align:middle line:84%

capacity to think and integrate

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:51.078 align:middle line:84%
and listen, intuition,
and perception.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.111 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%

as if there's energy

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.316 align:middle line:84%

where to place yet.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:84%
I know that my field can
literarily turn a room

of restless people
dead still in minutes.

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:08.295 align:middle line:84%
And so basically the agency
for my work is something both

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
that emanates through
me and then the things

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:84%
that I teach people to learn
how to do for themselves.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.204 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened to me,
I can't reproduce for anyone.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:84%
But my whole work is built
around trying to bring people

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.543 align:middle line:84%
in to such an immediate
experience with being

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:26.247 align:middle line:84%
in the now, being present, being
what I called radically alive,

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:28.782 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you're feeling.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:29.617 align:middle line:90%

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:30.584 align:middle line:90%
I am absolutely feeling that.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very transformative
experience.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.055 align:middle line:84%
It is. And you gave
the exact center

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.558 align:middle line:84%
where it's happening
in my solar plexus.

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:40.261 align:middle line:84%
So, take me back
to that experience

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.597 align:middle line:84%
when you are an ER doctor
and you had this type

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.866 align:middle line:90%
of surge coming to a room

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.036 align:middle line:84%
where there was probably not
a lot permission for that.

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:52.139 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know the first
time it really took me was

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
when I was coming to a patient
in the ER and I was going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.581 align:middle line:84%
to sedate him and keep him for
observation and a voice said

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.749 align:middle line:84%
to me-- there was
a nurse next to me

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.151 align:middle line:84%
with some syringes
to give medication.

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
This voice in my head that
I've never heard before said,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.957 align:middle line:84%
"You have nothing to share
with this man except love."

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So he's good, big guy
with two policeman there

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.131 align:middle line:84%
because he had been violent
and I just said to him,

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.899 align:middle line:84%
"I can't imagine what
you're actually feeling.

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to touch you so softly
that it can possibly hurt you."

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.073 align:middle line:84%
I put my hand just above his
head and my hand on his belly.

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.574 align:middle line:90%
I got blazing hot.

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:28.409 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.276 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The room got blazing hot.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:30.678 align:middle line:90%
The policeman opened the window.

00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:35.349 align:middle line:84%
The man's eyes rolled back in
his head and half an hour later

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.118 align:middle line:84%
when he woke up, he
was completely fine

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:90%
and we discharged him.

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.822 align:middle line:84%
And I went home and
said to myself,

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.257 align:middle line:90%
"What in the world was that?"

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What happened?

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.859 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And what does that
mean, you have nothing

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.162 align:middle line:90%
to share with this man?

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:49.363 align:middle line:90%
What kind of love is that?

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:90%
What kind-- that you-- So that--

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:53.834 align:middle line:84%
After that I started
really thinking it's time

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.636 align:middle line:84%
to have a leave of
absence for medicine.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:59.707 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a dream and it
made it really obvious to me

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:02.276 align:middle line:84%
that I-- it was time
for me to start living

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.678 align:middle line:84%
out of myself instead of
that of what I'd memorized

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:06.013 align:middle line:90%
to become a physician.

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:07.281 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Were you having
an inter-conflict

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.583 align:middle line:90%
with medicine prior to that or?

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.085 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In a certain sense, yes.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:15.122 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew psychologically
I didn't really belong

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:15.923 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:16.889 align:middle line:90%
It was a natural step form.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle line:90%
My mother had been a nurse.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.626 align:middle line:90%
It was the Vietnam War.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.762 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating to me.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:25.632 align:middle line:84%
I had never regretted one
minute being a doctor.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.901 align:middle line:84%
I didn't particularly like the
educational process 'cause it

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:29.503 align:middle line:84%
was that time and
probably is still

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:32.639 align:middle line:84%
in some degree, very
soul-deadening.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.409 align:middle line:84%
But the actual--
once you finished

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.013 align:middle line:84%
that educational process, the
opportunity to be with people

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:41.615 align:middle line:90%
and help them is just wonderful.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.783 align:middle line:90%

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.227 align:middle line:84%
it's mostly wrote
memorization without--

of it is that the nature

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.949 align:middle line:84%
of scientific empirical
exploration is

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that when you start with
something, it's a hypothesis.

If it doesn't help you stop

on this planet is interpersonal,
it's relational suffering.

of the problems that
people come to you

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
with as a spiritual healer now,
I will call you, is relational.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.521 align:middle line:84%

we talking about?

sense the relationship

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:04.331 align:middle line:84%
to yourself is inseparable from
your relationship to others

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:08.001 align:middle line:84%
and vice versa and that
relationship depends upon a

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.704 align:middle line:84%
different relationship which
is your internal relationship

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness
or mystery or God.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.709 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different words for it.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:20.714 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, the closer I get
to me, the closer I get to God,

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.449 align:middle line:90%
the closer I get to you.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.252 align:middle line:84%
And the distance I experience
from you if you're my husband,

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:29.356 align:middle line:84%
my wife-- obviously I
don't have a husband,

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.525 align:middle line:90%
but I mean the distance we feel

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:33.927 align:middle line:84%
from another is actually
a mirror of the distance

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:36.396 align:middle line:84%
from our own true
authentic selves.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.532 align:middle line:90%
So one, people don't come to me

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.267 align:middle line:84%
because they have
relationship problems.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:42.136 align:middle line:84%
They come because
they're seekers.

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.937 align:middle line:84%
They come because
they got that thorn

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:47.307 align:middle line:84%
in their heart that's saying
there's something more in life.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:50.677 align:middle line:84%

sometimes when I was--

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:11.899 align:middle line:84%
have a career, be a parent,
be a homemaker, is screaming

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:14.501 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "I want
to live now."

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:16.737 align:middle line:84%
And people don't know how
to let go and make space

00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:20.173 align:middle line:84%
for their soul's evolution
and that's where they come

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:24.611 align:middle line:84%
and find me and that's--
and then what we discover is

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.582 align:middle line:84%
so much loneliness, so
much hunger for intimacy

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:32.386 align:middle line:84%
in a larger sense, not
just sexual but connection.

00:07:32.386 --> 00:07:33.754 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:37.224 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Really connection being
heard, being seen, enjoying,

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.127 align:middle line:84%
you know, relationship
and they're suffering

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.595 align:middle line:90%
because it's not there.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.664 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In retrospect, looking
at the people that would come

00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:48.135 align:middle line:84%
in to the ER, did you
see them at a soul level

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:52.673 align:middle line:84%
that they created illnesses or
emergencies because of a lack

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.541 align:middle line:90%
of something in their lives?

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.243 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know, when I read
the question that you're going

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:59.446 align:middle line:84%
to ask me this, I loved it
because I thought to myself,

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:04.251 align:middle line:84%
"Can I put myself back 37 years
and step back into the ER?

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.219 align:middle line:90%
What did I see there?"

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.956 align:middle line:84%
I saw, first of all in the
ER in those days and maybe

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.792 align:middle line:90%
so true, is the poor people.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:18.298 align:middle line:84%
And I saw people who had
no idea what self awareness

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:90%
or self reflection is.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.204 align:middle line:84%
Who had abuse their bodies
often without alcohol or drugs

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.907 align:middle line:84%
who were possessed by their
tempers and lost control

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.576 align:middle line:84%
and hurt themselves
or hurt others.

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:31.612 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I saw a human suffering.

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:33.747 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I didn't
understand the nature

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:37.117 align:middle line:84%
of that suffering or the
cost of it but now I do.

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:40.186 align:middle line:84%
I think at the time I
loved emergency medicine

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.823 align:middle line:90%
because damn, you did something.

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:44.124 align:middle line:90%
If I got a diagnosis right,

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.093 align:middle line:84%
I remember the neurosurgeon
calling me up and said,

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:48.228 align:middle line:84%
"That was a good diagnosis,
you save that guy."

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's all about
diagnosis, yes, yes.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.232 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it's very
practical and concrete

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:53.967 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
loved about it.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.303 align:middle line:84%
But it was not-- you
know, what I missed,

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.238 align:middle line:84%
was that you never really
saw the people again.

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.139 align:middle line:90%
You never got to know them.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.607 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, yeah.

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And now in that experience that
you had, that energy that came

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.649 align:middle line:84%
through you, it was-- was like
a surge like I was experiencing

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:09.783 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the show,

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:14.655 align:middle line:84%
that surge of profound
enthusiasm and energy

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:17.524 align:middle line:84%
and soul force, I
think I can call it.

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:20.761 align:middle line:84%
Was that that came
through you at that moment?

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:24.464 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It came through me in
stages and finally one day

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.667 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote a book called
"The Black Butterfly".

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.836 align:middle line:84%
Finally, one day the
energy just became enormous.

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:30.971 align:middle line:90%
It was overwhelming.

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:32.339 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to
be annihilated and one

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of the beautiful things

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.909 align:middle line:84%
about having been a doctor
is I could quickly say,

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.377 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, I'm not psychotic.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is not a tumor of my
adrenal gland that's putting

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.049 align:middle line:90%
out so much adrenaline."

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:84%
This is something of a
phenomenological process

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.353 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't belong in medicine.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:47.754 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.423 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it is not commonly
written about, I had not come

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.892 align:middle line:84%
across it in psychiatry
or psychology.

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
Of course since then
there are things

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.896 align:middle line:84%
like spiritual emergencies,
spiritual emergence,

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of terminology.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
What it was, was the awakening
of the Kundalini energy

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.503 align:middle line:84%
if you're an Easterner or
what I think what we would

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:05.472 align:middle line:90%
cosmic consciousness.

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And it culminated at the moment

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
when a black butterfly
landed right on my forehead.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:84%
I'd watched these two
butterflies [inaudible],

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:14.948 align:middle line:84%
a dark one and a light
one mating on a branch.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.451 align:middle line:84%
I had spent three days and
nights watching my mind

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.119 align:middle line:84%
because of this overwhelming
energy.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.221 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying, "This
is a thought about me.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.389 align:middle line:84%
This is a thought
about the future.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:24.291 align:middle line:84%
This is a thought
about the past."

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:27.027 align:middle line:84%
And I kept myself centered
by just watching, watching,

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:29.029 align:middle line:84%
watching day and
night, day and night.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.063 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.398 align:middle line:84%
I just had some much
energy within me.

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:35.802 align:middle line:84%
The black butterfly landed
and I was one with everything.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.537 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I understood
the kingdom of heaven

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:40.607 align:middle line:84%
of is right here, just
we rarely ever see it.

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:42.209 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Let's talk
about that experience

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:44.411 align:middle line:84%
where you're watching your
thoughts and listening

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:46.613 align:middle line:84%
to what your thoughts
were about.

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:51.017 align:middle line:84%
So, we have mind chatter
quite often in our lives.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:56.323 align:middle line:84%
So I'm speaking about myself,
I will, in the collect we.

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:58.859 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm thinking about
the future or I'm thinking

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle line:84%
about how I'm appearing
in something.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:06.366 align:middle line:84%
I mean those are thoughts that
run my mind most of the day.

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.834 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.137 align:middle line:84%
Is that a separateness
from ourselves?

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:10.771 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:12.072 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It is, OK.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.508 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The basic
thing we all know is

00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:17.477 align:middle line:84%
that there's no other time
but now, but the intellect,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.746 align:middle line:84%
the mind, the thinking
self is never in the now.

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.649 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the now, you do
not think, you're just aware.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:23.884 align:middle line:90%
The man on the surfboard

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:27.354 align:middle line:84%
or the woman riding a
wave, they're not thinking.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.956 align:middle line:84%
Professional athlete,
golf stroke, tennis,

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:31.758 align:middle line:90%
whatever, they're not thinking.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:35.729 align:middle line:84%
They have to completely let
go and be body, environment,

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:38.298 align:middle line:84%
action, one thing, and
that's what happened to me

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:90%
when the black butterfly landed.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It became-- Everything
became one and it wasn't--

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle line:90%
I had done a lot of athletics.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.542 align:middle line:84%
I had-- I knew what it was
to be in flow, rock climbing,

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:51.378 align:middle line:84%
mountaineering, a
little bit on surfing.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.079 align:middle line:90%
I never became a great surfer.

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.117 align:middle line:84%
But-- Then suddenly this
experience was of a whole order

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.052 align:middle line:90%
of magnitude beyond it.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:02.055 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So how do you teach this
to someone who has anxiety,

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
who has fears that
are legitimate fears?

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:10.463 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach that art of
mindfulness to someone in this--

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.799 align:middle line:84%
in a place where they
are not aware of it?

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You don't teach
anyone till want to learn.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:15.468 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You know.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.506 align:middle line:84%
So nobody walks through
the door and gets into one

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.741 align:middle line:84%
of my retreats unless
they're asking questions.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.744 align:middle line:84%
They read my book,
something bounces of the page

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.981 align:middle line:84%
and they hear answers to
their own inner issues.

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:31.818 align:middle line:84%
That book teaches people
how to learn to deal

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:36.022 align:middle line:84%
with what their mind is creating
and what it's doing to them.

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.424 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We're going to
talk all about that, yeah.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.859 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so you
can teach people

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:41.027 align:middle line:84%
but it's not an intellectual
process.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.963 align:middle line:84%
When you recognize what
you're doing to yourself

00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:45.665 align:middle line:84%
with a thought is because
you feel that in your body

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:48.235 align:middle line:84%
and the problem with
most western people

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.804 align:middle line:84%
or most modern people is
we're never in our bodies.

00:12:50.804 --> 00:12:52.138 align:middle line:90%
We train our body.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:90%
We run. We jog.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.207 align:middle line:90%
We train it.

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.475 align:middle line:90%
But we're not in it.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.676 align:middle line:84%
You can be a professional
athlete

00:12:56.676 --> 00:13:00.146 align:middle line:84%
and have no idea what it
means to be in your body.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.349 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I try to explain
that to my daughter a lot

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.618 align:middle line:84%
when she's bumping into
things and she has no idea--

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:06.853 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how to tell
her, you're not in your body.

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:07.921 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: When you're in your body,

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.923 align:middle line:84%
you recognize what a
thought does to you.

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.558 align:middle line:84%
When you're in your
body, you recognize one

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:12.726 align:middle line:90%
of the weather of feeling.

00:13:12.726 --> 00:13:14.995 align:middle line:84%
The weather is beautiful
outside today

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:16.897 align:middle line:84%
that we're just new
here, you know.

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.399 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But what if
it's a storm tomorrow?

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.368 align:middle line:84%
Feeling is as mode
of consciousness

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.636 align:middle line:90%
and it changes all the time.

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.938 align:middle line:84%
But if it throws, if
it's a scary feeling,

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:27.507 align:middle line:84%
or threatening feeling,
it throws in thought.

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:30.143 align:middle line:84%
Those thoughts will
arose emotions like anger

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.612 align:middle line:90%
or bitterness or even fear.

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
You said normal fear.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very little truly
normal fear in the world.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.286 align:middle line:90%
It's almost all mind made.

00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: True, yes.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.423 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You stop the thoughts
when you have real fear,

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:47.294 align:middle line:84%
then a healthy relationship
to that is vulnerability.

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:49.396 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
working too much takes--

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:51.865 align:middle line:84%
avoid vulnerability or
they're buying things

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
to avoid vulnerability.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.136 align:middle line:84%
They're reshaping their
faces and their bodies

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.304 align:middle line:90%
to avoid vulnerability.

00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:00.307 align:middle line:84%
They're-- You know,
they're running away

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.676 align:middle line:84%
from through what they
imagine would be success.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle line:84%
But the-- Once you
lose vulnerability

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.114 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship,
you lose love.

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.917 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In this situation,
as my father who is afraid

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:15.455 align:middle line:84%
of his memory slipping and
he goes into so much fear

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle line:84%
when he forgets something that
it almost blocks him completely

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
ever remember it.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.196 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
explain to him to relax

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.766 align:middle line:84%
and he's an ex-medical
doctor like you are, retired.

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.936 align:middle line:90%
And to teach him mindfulness,

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:32.672 align:middle line:84%
I always having hard
time explaining it.

00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:84%
So today, what we're
doing in the show is

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
elements that you've describe

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in the course of this
experience that we're going

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.115 align:middle line:84%
to be able teach people
that you are going

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:43.984 align:middle line:90%
to be able to teach people.

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.385 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And this is through the
first element is understanding

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.323 align:middle line:90%
where and when to begin.

00:14:50.323 --> 00:14:54.227 align:middle line:84%
So where and how and when could
I tell my father to begin?

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.497 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, the only time
you could begin is now,

00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:59.632 align:middle line:90%
this moment, right?

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.801 align:middle line:84%
Because if you--
where would you begin?

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:04.904 align:middle line:84%
Would you begin with his
medical training that tells him

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that this lapses of memory
could be an indication

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.176 align:middle line:84%
of early onset dementia,
early onset Alzheimer's.

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.511 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.848 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know, he has to
begin now and you have to begin.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:17.283 align:middle line:84%
We all have to start now
'cause that's all we have.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.819 align:middle line:84%
So what we have in the
present moment is awareness.

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:21.121 align:middle line:90%
You can be aware.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:24.591 align:middle line:84%
I'm now telling myself a
story that I'm losing my mind.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.927 align:middle line:84%
And what's doing to me in
this moment is actually making

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:28.828 align:middle line:90%
me fearful.

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It's actually making me anxious.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm poisoning myself
with neurotransmitters

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that are constricting my
heart, tightening my breathing,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.273 align:middle line:84%
agitating me in this
moment because I'm starting

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:45.011 align:middle line:84%
from a memory that was taught
to me, medical education,

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.713 align:middle line:90%
and I'm jumping into the future.

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:47.213 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:47.914 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:49.049 align:middle line:90%
He starts with the past.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:49.983 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:51.217 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: He wasn't
like this before.

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:52.018 align:middle line:90%
He's read this stuff.

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:53.053 align:middle line:90%
He studied this stuff.

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.654 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now, oh, my God,
it's Alzheimer's.

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:56.022 align:middle line:90%
He jumps to the future.

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:57.457 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get
worse [inaudible].

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.093 align:middle line:84%
And he's terrifying
himself with the future.

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
He's remembering a past
that he thinks was healthy

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:84%
but [inaudible] information
that's he's using now

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to poison the present moment.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.369 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is doing
that all the time.

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:11.004 align:middle line:90%
It's not the situation.

00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:12.539 align:middle line:90%
It's the story you tell yourself

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:15.942 align:middle line:84%
about the situation
that's so disruptive.

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.378 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What if in that moment
somebody is saying something

00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:20.747 align:middle line:84%
that's upsetting you,
or criticizing you,

00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:23.483 align:middle line:84%
or saying something, is it--
again, even if that's happening

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, is it the story
that you're telling yourself

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.022 align:middle line:90%
about that conversation?

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: My life partner and
I, we practice what we call--

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
what I call consecrated
conversation,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.862 align:middle line:90%
which we teach to people.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:84%
If she starts saying something
to me that upsets me--

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:40.667 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.268 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know, A, I'm
listening with my head.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:43.336 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.437 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm listening
with my psychology,

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.406 align:middle line:84%
what I want to have
come from her.

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:50.877 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, I put my
ears, my listening in my heart

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:53.213 align:middle line:84%
and I just get bigger
and bigger and bigger

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.515 align:middle line:90%
until I can really hear her.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.417 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear her.

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:59.552 align:middle line:84%
I want her to show
me her reality.

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:01.287 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel her reality.

00:17:01.287 --> 00:17:02.622 align:middle line:90%
I don't know want to defend.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:06.225 align:middle line:84%
I want her to penetrate me
so that I can really know her

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.027 align:middle line:84%
and that creates a
field of connection

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.963 align:middle line:90%
where she's safe to be her.

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:11.231 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:13.433 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So the point is people
are constantly reacting

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:16.668 align:middle line:84%
to each other but not because
of what the other person does,

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.871 align:middle line:84%
but because of the
story they themselves.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:90%
"You don't care about me."

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:90%
"You don't love me."

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.774 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not important to you."

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:26.412 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those thoughts
is like a small dose of poison

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.949 align:middle line:84%
and they happen all day
long hundreds a day.

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And unless you wake up and
start right now and realize

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.224 align:middle line:84%
that was a thought that poisoned
me now is not actually--

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.594 align:middle line:84%
the only the truth of a thought
like that or the only truth

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:45.231 align:middle line:84%
of any belief whatsoever,
religious, political,

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.868 align:middle line:84%
economics is what it
makes you feel how to--

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:52.872 align:middle line:84%
what arouses in you
and how you behave.

00:17:52.872 --> 00:17:53.907 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So in--

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:54.908 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's the
truth of a thought.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:55.708 align:middle line:84%
The beliefs themselves,
there's no way

00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:57.076 align:middle line:90%
to prove that they're true.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.246 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, "You don't
care about me," the truth

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.782 align:middle line:84%
of that is it makes you
angry or it makes you sad.

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:03.716 align:middle line:90%
And then you close down.

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:90%
That's you're behavior.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.418 align:middle line:90%
Or you get aggressive.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.386 align:middle line:90%
That's your behavior.

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:07.787 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There is no other truth to
you don't care about me.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.692 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about an
abusive relationship

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.594 align:middle line:84%
where the abuse is
still occurring?

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.062 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Now, abuse is different.

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:16.563 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:17.263 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.798 align:middle line:90%
Abuse is the physical--

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:20.967 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Or emotional.

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:21.601 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.602 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.337 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can emotionally hurt you.

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:27.173 align:middle line:84%
It's the story you tell yourself
about what they say to you.

00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:30.076 align:middle line:84%
And if you put those
stories aside

00:18:30.076 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and that relationship is
still so unpleasant to be in,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
then you move on because there's
a-- it-- life is too precious.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.818 align:middle line:90%
Your body is a temple.

00:18:38.818 --> 00:18:41.421 align:middle line:84%
It should not be constantly
having to make space

00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:44.858 align:middle line:84%
for someone who's
posses by their stories.

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:48.127 align:middle line:84%
It has to be aggressive or
has to be attacking or it has

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:51.431 align:middle line:84%
to be dismissive,
you get up and go.

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:52.899 align:middle line:84%
Or you say, "Look,
I want to work

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:55.435 align:middle line:84%
on this relationship
'cause there's a--

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.637 align:middle line:84%
you whiz [phonetic] to have
an incredibly deep connection

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:58.404 align:middle line:90%
and we've lost it.

00:18:58.404 --> 00:18:59.606 align:middle line:90%
I want to work on it."

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.908 align:middle line:84%
And if the other person
says "Yes," then you start

00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:05.111 align:middle line:84%
down the path of really
working relationship

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:06.512 align:middle line:90%
which requires presence,

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:10.083 align:middle line:84%
it requires just the way
I describe how I listen

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
in my relationship and
in all my relationships

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.089 align:middle line:84%
and that requires
practice everyday.

00:19:16.089 --> 00:19:17.323 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It would also--

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.859 align:middle line:84%
that expansiveness would
also call to the attention.

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.062 align:middle line:84%
If there is something
innately wrong and then to have

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:26.866 align:middle line:84%
as enough self-worth and
self-love to exit out of

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.102 align:middle line:84%
that situation if
it's truly bad.

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.069 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And if it's physical
abuse, get out.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.005 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of course.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That-- You know, I'm not

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.409 align:middle line:84%
in any way condoning
physical abuse,

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:39.012 align:middle line:84%
I don't condone emotional
attack either.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you, first
find out what inside of you has

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to tell yourself a judgmental
or defensive or attacking story

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:84%
about your partner,
stop that in yourself

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.659 align:middle line:84%
and then you may find
there's no actual connect

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.927 align:middle line:84%
between you anymore
and you can walk out.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But what's going on
really if people stay

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.798 align:middle line:90%
in an abusive relationship,

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle line:84%
emotionally abusive
relationship,

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.635 align:middle line:84%
not a physical abusive
relationship,

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:90%
is that they are afraid.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.606 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid of being alone.

00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:08.474 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of abandonment.

00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:11.244 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of--
so they haven't got--

00:20:11.244 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
they haven't developed
in the now

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.182 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
only thing that exists.

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:19.118 align:middle line:84%
They haven't developed
the relationship to fear.

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And for the vast
majority of people,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.989 align:middle line:84%
fear is the god ruling
their lives.

00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:24.457 align:middle line:90%
It drives consumers.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It drives the cosmetic world.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.028 align:middle line:90%
It drives cosmetic surgery.

00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:32.765 align:middle line:84%
It drives-- 'Cause, you
know, basically materialism,

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:35.068 align:middle line:84%
we imagine that we
can find happiness

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.237 align:middle line:84%
from something outside,
because we don't how to make--

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:42.275 align:middle line:84%
a big enough space inside of
us in this moment for fear

00:20:42.275 --> 00:20:45.912 align:middle line:84%
for sensations, for fear
has-- is one sensation,

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:49.882 align:middle line:84%
a different intensities
with thousands of names.

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:53.486 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're in 22nd floors,
"Oh my God, fear of heights."

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.922 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how do you
make space for fear?

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.123 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's a practice.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:59.592 align:middle line:84%
You realized that
you'll never be safe,

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.528 align:middle line:84%
that when you make space
for fear, you're vulnerable.

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:04.831 align:middle line:84%
To be vulnerable in
a relationship means,

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:08.134 align:middle line:84%
I say to you what I really
feel and it can be almost

00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:10.603 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to die if I
tell you what I really feel,

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.137 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:21:11.137 --> 00:21:12.538 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:14.073 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This-- To overcome the
fact that you might reject me,

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:16.542 align:middle line:84%
or you might think I'm weak
or you might think needy--

00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:17.377 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:18.444 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- you know what I mean?

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing
to be vulnerable.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.447 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do?

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.316 align:middle line:84%
We get busy to not
be vulnerable.

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:24.951 align:middle line:84%
We work too much to
not be vulnerable.

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:25.785 align:middle line:90%
We drink--

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.486 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Protect yourselves, yes.

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:27.053 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- in every way--

00:21:27.053 --> 00:21:28.021 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:29.589 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- activity,
drugs, booze,

00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:33.326 align:middle line:84%
things to not be vulnerable and
once the vulnerability is gone

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:35.027 align:middle line:90%
as I think I said before so--

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:37.363 align:middle line:84%
or maybe when we were
talking before the show,

00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:39.432 align:middle line:90%
then the love is gone.

00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:42.902 align:middle line:84%
Without vulnerability people
can't connect and I was

00:21:42.902 --> 00:21:45.004 align:middle line:90%
so vulnerable in that awakening.

00:21:45.004 --> 00:21:47.206 align:middle line:90%
It just took me apart.

00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:48.341 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.609 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then when the
black butterfly landed

00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:51.878 align:middle line:84%
for a little while I knew
what it was like to be one

00:21:51.878 --> 00:21:53.613 align:middle line:90%
with everything, you know.

00:21:53.613 --> 00:21:56.149 align:middle line:84%
I knew what supernal peacement,
I knew what the peace,

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:59.118 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the peace that
passive understanding means

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:00.486 align:middle line:90%
when you read it in scripture.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.687 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:04.891 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what it
meant to be born again

00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:06.926 align:middle line:84%
in a very true sense
of the world.

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:07.727 align:middle line:90%
We're not--

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:08.861 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Unfair but--

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- not adapting a
religious belief system

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
because beliefs are again just
stories you tell yourself whose

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.402 align:middle line:84%
truth is that it makes
you feel a certain way

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:18.638 align:middle line:84%
or gives you a community
to join with

00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:21.207 align:middle line:90%
and determines your behavior.

00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:25.111 align:middle line:84%
But real faith has
no beliefs in at all.

00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:28.281 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That makes perfect sense,
now that you explain like that.

00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:30.249 align:middle line:90%
So, I'm learning vulnerability,

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:33.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning space
for vulnerability.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:36.222 align:middle line:84%
So element one was understanding
where and when to begin.

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.825 align:middle line:84%
Element two is live more
consistently in the now,

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
which we just talked
about and that brings is

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.962 align:middle line:90%
to "The Mandala of Being".

00:22:42.962 --> 00:22:44.297 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:22:44.297 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so this diagram
that you shared with us talks

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.368 align:middle line:84%
about how or either
in the present or--

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.537 align:middle line:84%
no, we're either in the
past or in the future.

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:52.638 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So my question

00:22:52.638 --> 00:22:55.975 align:middle line:84%
to the viewer is how
many nows do you see?

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:57.043 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: One?

00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.377 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK that's
what everybody says.

00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.212 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.113 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Actually there's five.

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
There's the now at the
center, which is the now

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.385 align:middle line:84%
of the professional athlete
whose mind disappears

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.753 align:middle line:90%
in to the perfect action.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:09.155 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The guy on the surfboard,
the women-- the Olympic skier,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.892 align:middle line:84%
any skier that when
you're in flow.

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:14.026 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Flow.

00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:15.828 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Or a person who's
practice contemplation

00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:19.465 align:middle line:84%
and deep meditation, that's
the now not condition,

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:21.834 align:middle line:84%
not effective, not
influenced, not determined

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.769 align:middle line:90%
by any form of thought.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:90%
And it's the now of being--

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:27.707 align:middle line:84%
without resistance
to what you feel.

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:31.143 align:middle line:84%
The other four nows,
the one that says me,

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:35.081 align:middle line:84%
that's the now created in this
moment when you judge yourself.

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.617 align:middle line:84%
And you judge yourself to be
smarter and to know what needs

00:23:37.617 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:84%
to be done, so you make yourself
special but you puff up and big,

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:42.889 align:middle line:90%
grandiose, specialness.

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:45.124 align:middle line:84%
Or you judge yourself to
be not so good, you know,

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:48.261 align:middle line:84%
and not as attractive and,
you know, not a smart,

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.696 align:middle line:84%
and so you make yourself
special but its depressive.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a now when you
tell-- judge other people.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.836 align:middle line:84%
You either make them bigger,
you make them smaller it leads

00:23:56.836 --> 00:24:01.674 align:middle line:84%
to envy, or adoration, or
resentment, or bitterness,

00:24:01.674 --> 00:24:03.109 align:middle line:90%
those are the 'you' stories.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:05.478 align:middle line:84%
So when you believe the
judgment of another,

00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:08.948 align:middle line:84%
or judgment of your situation,
or judgment of your career,

00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:12.251 align:middle line:84%
you're poisoning yourself at
those judgment but they're not--

00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:15.288 align:middle line:84%
so you're in the now
created by the emotion,

00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
the arousal of those stories.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:22.228 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the past,
it's gone, most memory comes

00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:25.598 align:middle line:84%
from the-- is activated
in the same part

00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:28.334 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that's
has imagination.

00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:32.605 align:middle line:84%
So the actual what really memory
is, is re imagining the past.

00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:34.006 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:35.374 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And if you depress today
you'll re-imagine the situation

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:38.344 align:middle line:84%
with your father 20, or 30,
or 40 years ago in such a way

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:39.579 align:middle line:90%
as to support depression.

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:42.348 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really
feeling joyous today and full

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:45.284 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, you'll
re-imagine the exact same memory

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:90%
without the effect on you.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.188 align:middle line:90%
So we re-imagine the past

00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:52.224 align:middle line:84%
to support the emotional
state we're in right now,

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's either going to
be a positive reminiscence

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.863 align:middle line:84%
which turns me into "Oh, I fell
good;" or negative reminiscence

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:00.066 align:middle line:90%
where I feel regret and guilt

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:03.035 align:middle line:84%
and depress and sad
and a victim.

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:04.036 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ah-huh.

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:05.237 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And same thing
with the future.

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You're going either
anticipate the future

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.509 align:middle line:84%
with positive expectancy,
eagerness, and hope,

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.079 align:middle line:84%
and excitement, or
negative expectancy.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:15.615 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So each one of
those a littler mini nows,

00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:16.849 align:middle line:90%
is that what you say?

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:20.019 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Almost-- The only
now most people know except

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:22.221 align:middle line:84%
when their in the state
of flow, and love making,

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:25.291 align:middle line:84%
or the rare poet who just
lets poetry come through the--

00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:27.627 align:middle line:84%
but the surfer that goes back
to surf everyday wants to be

00:25:27.627 --> 00:25:29.662 align:middle line:90%
in the center of that mandala.

00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ah-huh.

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.664 align:middle line:84%
The dancer, who wants
to let go--

00:25:31.664 --> 00:25:32.431 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:32.965 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- and be danced--

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:34.066 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:35.468 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- you know,
[inaudible] song maniac.

00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:39.405 align:middle line:84%
She's dancing into danger zone
with a dancer becomes the dance.

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the center now, the rest

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
of the time almost everybody
is living in the now created

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.046 align:middle line:84%
by their future thoughts, their
past thoughts, their judgment

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:48.748 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, the
judgment of others,

00:25:48.748 --> 00:25:50.883 align:middle line:90%
and you can learn to watch that.

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:53.185 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: OK so what if we go
into an office environment

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.553 align:middle line:90%
where you work, and you--

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.789 align:middle line:84%
it's a negative environment
because people around you,

00:25:56.789 --> 00:26:00.159 align:middle line:84%
and the boss, and those
situation whatever is negative.

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:04.196 align:middle line:84%
Can you go in there with
the expansive feeling--

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:08.801 align:middle line:84%
this other diagram that we
have up is expansive feeling,

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:12.171 align:middle line:84%
can you go in there and
expand that feeling?

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.141 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, yesterday I was
talking to someone from Denmark

00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:16.642 align:middle line:90%
over Skype counseling.

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.879 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I talk to people all
over the world, when I'm at home

00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:84%
and doing private sessions and
it was exactly this issue--

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.684 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:26:24.684 --> 00:26:25.217 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- you know,
the work environment.

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:26.419 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what was one of
her stories about work?

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.991 align:middle line:84%
One of her stories about work
was that they don't really care

00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:33.659 align:middle line:84%
about me, the other
people at work.

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.994 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:37.897 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Another story was this
work doesn't really tap my

00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.198 align:middle line:90%
creative potential.

00:26:39.198 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So those beliefs that woman
had dropped her energy,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.572 align:middle line:90%
made her depress and made--

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:48.607 align:middle line:90%
I said that she's looking

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.277 align:middle line:84%
to change her career,
her work environment.

00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.511 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:55.481 align:middle line:84%
But as I listen to her it
was clear that nothing--

00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:58.617 align:middle line:84%
she'd had a dream about a baby,
but the baby couldn't walk yet,

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.086 align:middle line:90%
she had the hold its hands.

00:27:00.086 --> 00:27:02.888 align:middle line:84%
I said "It's very clear that
your next face has been born

00:27:02.888 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:90%
in you but it's not yet ready.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So your work is to stay
in this environment,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.296 align:middle line:84%
watch every story you tell
your self all day long

00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:13.399 align:middle line:84%
about these other people, it's
not a negative environment,

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:84%
it's your reaction to the
others that's creating a

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:17.436 align:middle line:90%
negative environment.

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:20.106 align:middle line:84%
And if at the end of the day
you can come home with as much

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:22.675 align:middle line:84%
or more energy than
you started that day,

00:27:22.675 --> 00:27:25.344 align:middle line:84%
then after six months
you're going to be

00:27:25.344 --> 00:27:29.081 align:middle line:84%
at such a new vibration in
yourself, psychologically,

00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:31.317 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, spiritually,
energetically,

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:33.119 align:middle line:84%
a new life is going
to come toward you.

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:35.988 align:middle line:84%
It's going to-- you're going to
magnetize a completely new life

00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and you won't be holding
that baby anymore.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.794 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be ready to lead
you into your next career.

00:27:41.794 --> 00:27:44.964 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: OK, so you lost at paying
attention to the thoughts.

00:27:44.964 --> 00:27:46.832 align:middle line:84%
Now what are the thoughts
that she's paying attention

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:47.933 align:middle line:90%
to are negative thought?

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you bridge from
that attention to--

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.873 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, give me an
example of a negative thought.

00:27:53.873 --> 00:27:56.008 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I don't like
this environment.

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.143 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:27:57.143 --> 00:27:59.178 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to
have a concept like,

00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:02.047 align:middle line:90%
"I don't like this environment,"

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
because concepts are
always pairs of opposites.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.988 align:middle line:84%
Without having put into your
unconscious or your shadow,

00:28:08.988 --> 00:28:11.123 align:middle line:90%
I do like this environment.

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:11.624 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:28:11.624 --> 00:28:12.858 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:15.227 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So I pull out-- I
say "OK pull out the twin."

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.629 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:28:16.629 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What's the evidence for
I don't like this environment?

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:90%
Well the people--

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: People.

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:20.599 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- aren't very friendly.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
People are--

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.102 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I don't like my
job or whatever, OK.

00:28:23.102 --> 00:28:25.771 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what's the evidence
for I do like this environment?

00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:27.873 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday exactly, this exact--

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:28.507 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great.

00:28:28.507 --> 00:28:29.441 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- process.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
She goes, "Well,
I do my job well.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.648 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of approval for
how good I do with my job."

00:28:35.648 --> 00:28:37.016 align:middle line:90%
It's a chance to be with people.

00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:39.251 align:middle line:84%
It's a chance to have a social
environment even though some

00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:42.021 align:middle line:84%
of them, you know, are
not easy for me but it's--

00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and on and on finding
evidence for I do.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:51.063 align:middle line:84%
So this woman, by showing her
these two stories that are--

00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:54.867 align:middle line:84%
that exist simultaneously
one makes her--

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:56.735 align:middle line:84%
I ask her, "Which body
do you rather be in?"

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.671 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "The one
that says, you know,

00:28:58.671 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:90%
I like my work environment.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:03.309 align:middle line:84%
And as now look for
evidence to support that."

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:05.411 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "In which
one of those two stories,

00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:07.046 align:middle line:84%
I don't like my work
environment or I do

00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:10.683 align:middle line:84%
like my work environment,
are you more open,

00:29:10.683 --> 00:29:13.085 align:middle line:84%
available is the
relational quality,

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:14.653 align:middle line:90%
the relational feel more alive?"

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:16.956 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's
much more alive.

00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:19.725 align:middle line:84%
As you felt in your
body when I say I do

00:29:19.725 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:90%
like my work environment.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.463 align:middle line:84%
Now someone else say that's
lie, but it's not a lie.

00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:28.067 align:middle line:84%
Your psychology, depressive
specialness usually,

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
selects all the evidence
that it needs

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.738 align:middle line:84%
in any moment, in
any environment--

00:29:32.738 --> 00:29:33.706 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Sure.

00:29:33.706 --> 00:29:35.007 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- to support
its position.

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:38.244 align:middle line:84%
So you eliminate, you say,
"My mother didn't love me."

00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:40.079 align:middle line:84%
But in fact she'll
loved tremendously

00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:43.649 align:middle line:84%
but from your depressive
specialness you select all the

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:84%
evidence and incidents
in your history

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.019 align:middle line:90%
where she didn't love you,

00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:84%
you don't select the
ones where she did.

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.857 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit there with
people to get them direct

00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:55.194 align:middle line:84%
and then once you realize
you can't believe both

00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:56.829 align:middle line:90%
of these at the same time.

00:29:56.829 --> 00:30:00.766 align:middle line:84%
The stories drop and you end
up in present moment awareness.

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:04.169 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So I mean if you work
at a place that people came

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:07.206 align:middle line:84%
in to pay parking ticket,
imagine everyone coming

00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
in is upset, you could hold on
to this space that you're saying

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.315 align:middle line:84%
of these expansiveness
and opportunity and flow

00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:19.218 align:middle line:84%
and change your working
environment completely,

00:30:19.218 --> 00:30:22.121 align:middle line:84%
regardless of opposition
that might be coming at you.

00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:26.091 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you start as
the diagram shows the arrow,

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:28.527 align:middle line:84%
when we're in expansive feeling
the arrows are pointing toward

00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the now, not conditioned
by thought.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.799 align:middle line:84%
You can function perfectly
well at any job being

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:37.002 align:middle line:84%
in the now not thinking,
because your awareness

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.504 align:middle line:90%
and your intuitive faculties

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:41.974 align:middle line:84%
and your embodied sense
will process information

00:30:41.974 --> 00:30:44.977 align:middle line:84%
so much more superiorly
than the thinking you.

00:30:44.977 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you could sit in any
job whatsoever if you chose

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.015 align:middle line:90%
to and become luminous.

00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:51.116 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Gosh, that's beautiful.

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Anybody--

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.418 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is--

00:30:52.418 --> 00:30:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- anywhere--

00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:53.752 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: -- excellent.

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:54.954 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- can do it.

00:30:54.954 --> 00:30:57.323 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That is incredible,
incredible awareness.

00:30:57.323 --> 00:30:58.824 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But it's practice.

00:30:58.824 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:90%
I've-- This is my practice.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:03.329 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But it's an
option and it's a choice.

00:31:03.329 --> 00:31:06.966 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you say that
it's possible enables people

00:31:06.966 --> 00:31:08.233 align:middle line:90%
to say, "OK, I want to try that.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.501 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and try that.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.369 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you feel it siting
with me, you feel the--

00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:11.737 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I totally feel it.

00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:13.138 align:middle line:90%
I feel--

00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Feel that energy of what
is like to just be in the body

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.575 align:middle line:90%
in the now without a thought.

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:19.078 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Be in a-- in
a expansive space.

00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:21.046 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you this
is so much more fun.

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.083 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Than go-- than laboring

00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:26.218 align:middle line:84%
through moments that
are so long.

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.254 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is great,
this is-- this is--

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.557 align:middle line:84%
this is exciting
and invigorating.

00:31:31.557 --> 00:31:34.059 align:middle line:84%
One little word you said
that I want to do ask you

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:37.696 align:middle line:84%
about you said in that moment
of that awakening you had,

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:39.932 align:middle line:84%
you felt like you
are going to explode.

00:31:39.932 --> 00:31:43.235 align:middle line:84%
I completely can understand
what you're talking about,

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:46.438 align:middle line:84%
because this is boundless
energy.

00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:48.073 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It is boundless energy.

00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:49.375 align:middle line:90%
And you know, what the--

00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: More than almost the
physical body can contain.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.445 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's what my struggle
was from many, many years.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Got it.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.215 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To teach my physical
body how to contain it.

00:31:56.215 --> 00:31:57.983 align:middle line:84%
And when the sensation
was overwhelming,

00:31:57.983 --> 00:32:01.387 align:middle line:84%
not to believe the
thoughts created in my mind,

00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:03.756 align:middle line:84%
'cause that cause me to
contract into emotion,

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:05.391 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'm going to loss my mind.

00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:06.892 align:middle line:90%
I can't sustain this.

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able to
live like this.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.461 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of thoughts,

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:12.431 align:middle line:84%
future thoughts created
fear, I got smaller.

00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.532 align:middle line:90%
I got smaller.

00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:15.501 align:middle line:84%
The energy became more
and more unbearable.

00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:17.403 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go out for
a walk or I'd sing

00:32:17.403 --> 00:32:19.738 align:middle line:84%
and so was singing this
was coming spontaneously

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:20.406 align:middle line:90%
through me--

00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.473 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wonderful.

00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:22.841 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And suddenly
I'm expansive again,

00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.211 align:middle line:84%
because I've come back into my
body, back into this breath,

00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:27.413 align:middle line:90%
back into this--

00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:31.183 align:middle line:84%
these perception is what
is actually happening now.

00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:32.418 align:middle line:90%
And what people have

00:32:32.418 --> 00:32:35.454 align:middle line:84%
to understand is I'm a very
high functioning person

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:38.424 align:middle line:84%
that plans the future and--
but I live in the now.

00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:39.358 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's the difference

00:32:39.358 --> 00:32:41.193 align:middle line:84%
between expansion
and contraction.

00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:42.995 align:middle line:84%
It's those things
that contract you

00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:44.696 align:middle line:84%
and those things
that expand you.

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:48.233 align:middle line:84%
And if you can take the things
that contract you and choose

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:50.869 align:middle line:84%
to be expanded within
those things, those go away

00:32:50.869 --> 00:32:52.504 align:middle line:84%
and new opportunities
come about.

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:53.672 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:54.473 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's like constant
looking at the view

00:32:54.473 --> 00:32:55.674 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean, which I love.

00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:59.978 align:middle line:84%
So the element-- the three
differentiating emotions

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:90%
from feelings which you talked

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:84%
about element before is you
do not need to fix yourself.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.452 align:middle line:84%
Now don't intellectualize
this conversation,

00:33:06.452 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:90%
just go along with this.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.322 align:middle line:84%
What is that mean, you do
not need to fix yourself?

00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.891 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Too much of
psychology starts with the idea

00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:14.159 align:middle line:84%
that something is
wrong with you.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:16.462 align:middle line:84%
I was on the phone today
with a man who's very worried

00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:18.864 align:middle line:84%
about his kids because
they're being called ADHD

00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:21.033 align:middle line:90%
and other kinds of things.

00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Labels.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.035 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And I said, "Well,

00:33:23.035 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the 6-year-old has the most
simple defense of all."

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.573 align:middle line:84%
The 6-year-old is the
problem, he's aggressive.

00:33:27.573 --> 00:33:30.209 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well the 6-year-old
has chosen rebellion,

00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:32.744 align:middle line:84%
anytime he thinks there's
any authority that's not fair

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:34.913 align:middle line:84%
to him whether it comes
from you or his mother

00:33:34.913 --> 00:33:37.082 align:middle line:90%
or teacher at school, he rebels.

00:33:37.082 --> 00:33:40.018 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when an energy
takes him over it's so strong

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.688 align:middle line:84%
and he's a big kid for
his age, he's physical.

00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:47.426 align:middle line:84%
Your other kid, he took
the withdrawal route.

00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:48.827 align:middle line:90%
He goes into his books.

00:33:48.827 --> 00:33:50.796 align:middle line:84%
He's focused on what
he wants to focus on.

00:33:50.796 --> 00:33:54.199 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have ADHD, he has
tremendous capacity to focus

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:58.103 align:middle line:84%
on what he is interested in and
that's how he protects himself

00:33:58.103 --> 00:34:00.973 align:middle line:84%
from the conflict between
the man and his wife,

00:34:00.973 --> 00:34:03.475 align:middle line:84%
from the conflict that surround
him in every environment.

00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:05.978 align:middle line:84%
And he's just going
to grow up just fine.

00:34:05.978 --> 00:34:09.214 align:middle line:84%
But the labels are
killing people everywhere.

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:12.383 align:middle line:84%
Just start to be a champion
for the health and normalness

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.419 align:middle line:84%
of your kids, forget
about these labels."

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.789 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about the one
with the aggressiveness?

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:18.657 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, there's-- there's
a point where you have to say

00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to a child, "This
really matters to me."

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.728 align:middle line:84%
And show him that
it really, or her,

00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:90%
that it really matters to you.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.497 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that it's not

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:29.133 align:middle line:84%
that the kid is diseased,
this is his defense.

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:30.334 align:middle line:90%
Rebellion is a defense.

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It's primitive.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.671 align:middle line:84%
Rebellion, withdrawal,
and pleasing,

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:36.208 align:middle line:84%
think about all the women
you know in particular

00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:38.744 align:middle line:84%
who have sacrifice
their sense of being

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:41.046 align:middle line:84%
to please their parents,
to please their husbands,

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:43.849 align:middle line:84%
to please their children, to
please their boss, you know,

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:45.316 align:middle line:90%
and they're not alive.

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:46.718 align:middle line:84%
And one day they
wake up and say,

00:34:46.718 --> 00:34:49.588 align:middle line:84%
"Pleasing isn't a good
adaptation as an adult.

00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:52.324 align:middle line:84%
But pleasing is so good when
you are in this classroom

00:34:52.324 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
with a teacher who doesn't
want to struggle with you."

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.063 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the rebel is a problem
and the introvert that focuses

00:34:58.063 --> 00:34:59.198 align:middle line:90%
in on the-- but that's the--

00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:00.465 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you want to
be the good little girl.

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:01.266 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's the
problem, you know.

00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:02.434 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And pretty soon
we got these labels.

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:07.439 align:middle line:84%
When in reality people--
people learn in different ways

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:10.409 align:middle line:84%
and if there's-- we need
people to be different.

00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:13.212 align:middle line:84%
The only trouble is our
educational system is a one size

00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:15.447 align:middle line:90%
fits all and doesn't work.

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:17.182 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that's when you
bring in your choice of what

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.818 align:middle line:84%
to be expanded about and
what to be contracted about.

00:35:19.818 --> 00:35:21.954 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well I said
to him, be a champion

00:35:21.954 --> 00:35:23.922 align:middle line:90%
for your son, your sons.

00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:27.025 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're the one that
believes in them the most.

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:31.697 align:middle line:84%
And whenever they do something
that you feel is a violation

00:35:31.697 --> 00:35:33.799 align:middle line:84%
of proper boundaries,
don't be worried

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:36.935 align:middle line:84%
about whether they're ill,
show them what matters to you.

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:40.439 align:middle line:84%
Set the-- Set the boundary and
then continue being a champion,

00:35:40.439 --> 00:35:42.307 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
accept their behavior

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:44.309 align:middle line:90%
without every rejecting them.

00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:90%
He say, this--

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.612 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:35:46.612 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You-- I believe in
you in every possible way

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:52.718 align:middle line:84%
that behavior doesn't--
doesn't work for me, you know.

00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:53.986 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's inclusive.

00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:59.725 align:middle line:84%
All right, so wow, element
five is effort and grace,

00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:01.226 align:middle line:90%
is there a difference?

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:03.595 align:middle line:84%
Is-- they're the same--
Is it the same thing?

00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:06.365 align:middle line:84%
How-- What is effort
and grace mean?

00:36:06.365 --> 00:36:08.767 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Effort is you
wake up in the middle

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.536 align:middle line:84%
of telling yourself a me story
that's making you depressive,

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.037 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:13.238 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:14.473 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you say, "I'm
going to start right now."

00:36:14.473 --> 00:36:15.807 align:middle line:90%
You wake up in the middle

00:36:15.807 --> 00:36:18.343 align:middle line:84%
of the future story that's
making you anxious and afraid

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:21.914 align:middle line:84%
or hopeful in a way that's
actually going to 'cause you

00:36:21.914 --> 00:36:23.949 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the stock marker
much too long, you know,

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:26.785 align:middle line:90%
that kind of foolish hope.

00:36:26.785 --> 00:36:29.254 align:middle line:84%
A person living in the present
moment never needs hope,

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
because they're living
with what is.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.859 align:middle line:84%
Hope is only for
people who can't stay

00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:90%
on the present moment.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.194 align:middle line:90%
You don't need hope.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about goals
in futures setting and--

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:39.765 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what, I
have tremendous goals.

00:36:39.765 --> 00:36:43.568 align:middle line:84%
I want to heal as many people
as I can and the moment I say

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.405 align:middle line:84%
to myself I'm not doing enough
and feel what that thoughts

00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:47.906 align:middle line:90%
to me, does to me I drop it.

00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:50.275 align:middle line:84%
If I heard the thought
God wants you do to more

00:36:50.275 --> 00:36:52.911 align:middle line:84%
and it made my body even
slightly contracted,

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I throw away that
God and that thought.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.849 align:middle line:84%
This temple doesn't
need that misery.

00:36:57.849 --> 00:36:59.217 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.652 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm not-- So that's the
practice that's the effort.

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:03.689 align:middle line:84%
The grace is the
current you feel,

00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:06.058 align:middle line:84%
that I feel all the
time coming through me.

00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:07.092 align:middle line:90%
Not all the time.

00:37:07.092 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
moments particularly

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.828 align:middle line:90%
in intimate relationship

00:37:09.828 --> 00:37:13.198 align:middle line:84%
where my early childhood
staff gets triggered, but I--

00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.901 align:middle line:84%
I'm now know how to be a very
vulnerable in that as oppose

00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:19.171 align:middle line:84%
to close down, shutoff,
withdraw, or get aggressive.

00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:20.639 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Got it.

00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:23.308 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, you know,
I'm a work in progress.

00:37:23.308 --> 00:37:26.278 align:middle line:84%
The effort is how you
want to invent yourself.

00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:28.413 align:middle line:90%
The grace is that you can.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:31.383 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This is an amazing
tool for going into some

00:37:31.383 --> 00:37:34.353 align:middle line:84%
of the most negative environment
and transforming yourself

00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:35.887 align:middle line:90%
within that environment.

00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:37.289 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then transforming the
environment and those that are

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.326 align:middle line:90%
around you in response to that.

00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:43.962 align:middle line:90%
If you choose to invent yourself

00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:46.732 align:middle line:84%
by doing what this book
teaches people how to do--

00:37:46.732 --> 00:37:47.833 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh gosh, we
haven't even talked

00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:50.068 align:middle line:84%
about the self healing
aspects of all this.

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.003 align:middle line:90%
Well here is a technique.

00:37:51.003 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a look at of--

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:54.439 align:middle line:90%
of what Richard talks about.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:58.076 align:middle line:84%
How do you use breath to get to
this transformative experience?

00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:59.211 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:37:59.211 --> 00:38:02.347 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's so easy to
get caught in our heads,

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:03.849 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most
important things

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:07.986 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn is how very
quickly to center ourselves.

00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:12.824 align:middle line:84%
So here's one way
that you can practice.

00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:13.925 align:middle line:90%
The nature of consciousness

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:16.995 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment
is very different

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
than what we learn in school.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.932 align:middle line:84%
In school we focus
and we narrow.

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:23.435 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness in the
present moment when you're

00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:25.370 align:middle line:84%
in deep meditation,
when you're surfing,

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.774 align:middle line:84%
when you're skiing is
an extraordinary sense

00:38:28.774 --> 00:38:33.879 align:middle line:84%
of the vividness of all your
perceptions and expansiveness.

00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:37.349 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to
do is shift from time

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:38.717 align:middle line:90%
to time to your breathing.

00:38:38.717 --> 00:38:43.922 align:middle line:84%
Focus for example on this
sensation of the air moving

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:49.828 align:middle line:84%
through your nostrils, it's
very easy sensation to find,

00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:53.265 align:middle line:84%
you can have your eye open,
you can have your eyes closed.

00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:58.403 align:middle line:84%
Bring that sensation
into real vividness.

00:38:58.403 --> 00:39:00.972 align:middle line:84%
If you have to close your eyes
in order to concentrate on it

00:39:00.972 --> 00:39:05.143 align:middle line:84%
for a moment or two for a
few breaths, close your eyes.

00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:07.813 align:middle line:84%
But in daily life we want
to be able to be centered

00:39:07.813 --> 00:39:09.214 align:middle line:90%
and have our eye open.

00:39:09.214 --> 00:39:15.554 align:middle line:84%
So if your eyes open sensing the
breath moving through your nose,

00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:19.357 align:middle line:84%
aware of the light around
you, the sounds around you,

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:24.129 align:middle line:84%
all your perceptions vivid,
simultaneously imagine

00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:27.365 align:middle line:84%
that your mind is
limitless like space.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:31.903 align:middle line:84%
In fact the notion of the
universe conveys a sense

00:39:31.903 --> 00:39:36.842 align:middle line:84%
of spacial vastness that the
mind itself is the vastness

00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:40.178 align:middle line:84%
in which the concept of
the universe is present.

00:39:40.178 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So let yourself get
spacious, feel your body and

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.888 align:middle line:84%
yet keep the sensation of
your breath truly vivid,

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.957 align:middle line:90%
very precise.

00:39:51.957 --> 00:39:56.061 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the space
around you, realize it's now,

00:39:56.061 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the universe right
in this moment, always now.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.636 align:middle line:90%
The mind in that sense limitless

00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:11.276 align:middle line:84%
and there is the very vivid
perception of your breath,

00:40:11.276 --> 00:40:15.947 align:middle line:84%
the light, the colors, the
sounds, sensations in your body,

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and have five breaths.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:27.225 align:middle line:90%
[ Pause ]

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:40.505 align:middle line:90%
Focused and spacious.

00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:44.109 align:middle line:84%
Precise awareness of your
whole body, of your breathing

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:49.748 align:middle line:84%
and sense that mind in the
largest sense is limitless.

00:40:49.748 --> 00:40:53.184 align:middle line:84%
So if we were scientist, you'd
focus on what you're studying,

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:57.522 align:middle line:84%
but you wouldn't lose the
sense of a wholistic system,

00:40:57.522 --> 00:40:59.791 align:middle line:84%
everything connected to
every thing else perspective

00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.059 align:middle line:90%
which is what is lost.

00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:06.031 align:middle line:84%
So just become aware
of five breaths.

00:41:06.031 --> 00:41:09.301 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you find yourself
agitated, hurrying,

00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:84%
starting to get caught
in emotions,

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.438 align:middle line:90%
come back to the present moment.

00:41:13.438 --> 00:41:21.079 align:middle line:84%
Five focus breaths with a
spacious mind precise awareness

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:25.684 align:middle line:84%
of your breathing, your
senses all attuned to anything

00:41:25.684 --> 00:41:30.221 align:middle line:84%
and everything, in
the sense, wow,

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.059 align:middle line:90%
the mind extends limitlessly.

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:36.228 align:middle line:90%
Five more breaths.

00:41:36.228 --> 00:41:45.303 align:middle line:90%
[ Pause ]

00:41:54.145 --> 00:41:56.715 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't going to stop
to meditate for half an hour

00:41:56.715 --> 00:42:00.018 align:middle line:84%
or 20 minutes or 40 minutes
or an hour in the morning,

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:03.955 align:middle line:84%
but if you do these practice
five breaths, allowing yourself

00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:10.328 align:middle line:84%
to become so precisely focused
and vast, open at the same time,

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:13.665 align:middle line:84%
that will 'cause your
arousal level, the stimulation

00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:16.501 align:middle line:84%
of your thoughts, the emotions
they generate will come

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:17.902 align:middle line:90%
down just a little bit.

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.372 align:middle line:84%
And if 20 minutes later you do
five more breaths, it will come

00:42:20.372 --> 00:42:21.873 align:middle line:90%
down again a little bit.

00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:24.542 align:middle line:84%
And if through the day
five breaths takes what?

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.011 align:middle line:90%
20 seconds?

00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:27.312 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds?

00:42:27.312 --> 00:42:31.316 align:middle line:84%
So through the day if you--
if you did this 20 times,

00:42:31.316 --> 00:42:34.853 align:middle line:84%
you would be spending five,
six, seven minutes at most

00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:37.288 align:middle line:84%
and it will really
help you center.

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:43.361 align:middle line:84%
So take hold of this
practice and make it yours.

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:47.499 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: How do you use that
experience of breath work

00:42:47.499 --> 00:42:50.568 align:middle line:84%
in something like a traffic
jam that we're looking

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle line:84%
at outside the window,
there's obviously--

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.471 align:middle line:90%
it's a holiday weekend.

00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:58.777 align:middle line:84%
So there's a large traffic
jam or you mentioned

00:42:58.777 --> 00:43:01.479 align:middle line:90%
in airport lines or in--

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:03.615 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Or riding in
wheelchairs I've had to do in--

00:43:03.615 --> 00:43:06.751 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of my travel
last one and a half months.

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:12.691 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not perfected,
I could get irritated,

00:43:12.691 --> 00:43:15.560 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as I see
myself doing that to myself,

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.797 align:middle line:84%
I'd basically start
breathing just the way we were

00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:20.165 align:middle line:90%
demonstrating it.

00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:22.867 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's a choice,
it's a choice is I--

00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:24.803 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to poison
myself because I'm

00:43:24.803 --> 00:43:27.172 align:middle line:84%
out of control because, you
know, maybe I'm not going

00:43:27.172 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:90%
to make the appointment.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.342 align:middle line:84%
The people in that traffic
jam, they just may not get

00:43:30.342 --> 00:43:32.043 align:middle line:84%
to where they want to get
to, when they get there--

00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:33.378 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I can empathize
without frustrating that is--

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.683 align:middle line:84%
and yet it's a wonderful
place to practice.

00:43:38.683 --> 00:43:41.586 align:middle line:84%
Practice breathing, practice
letting go of any story.

00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.955 align:middle line:84%
If you say for example, I have
to get to that appointment.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:45.256 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be miserable.

00:43:45.256 --> 00:43:49.027 align:middle line:84%
If you say, "OK, what is
actually have to do right now?"

00:43:49.027 --> 00:43:51.496 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm just sitting in
a car that's hardly moving.

00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:52.464 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.165 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And your body
becomes spacious

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:56.801 align:middle line:84%
and you become at
peace in yourself.

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:58.837 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least even if you're
not getting to where you need

00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:01.206 align:middle line:84%
to get to, you're not
poisoning yourself.

00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:05.443 align:middle line:84%
And that actually-- that
quality of your own presence,

00:44:05.443 --> 00:44:08.179 align:middle line:84%
that purity of your own
presence is a gift to all

00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:10.582 align:middle line:84%
of existence, it
radiates from you.

00:44:10.582 --> 00:44:13.485 align:middle line:84%
When I say who-- or
begins now, who we--

00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:16.354 align:middle line:90%
we will ever be begins now.

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:19.124 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well I'm thinking
about that maybe, I mean,

00:44:19.124 --> 00:44:21.626 align:middle line:84%
there's an accident obviously
that stopped the traffic,

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:24.696 align:middle line:84%
and the person that's in
that's accident, so let's talk

00:44:24.696 --> 00:44:27.265 align:middle line:84%
about that, when you're
in that place of crisis,

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:30.535 align:middle line:90%
how do you use this to heal?

00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean to heal from the
inside out, to heal the body?

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.643 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well as I said, you know,
from being a reactive man four

00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and a half months ago, I
developed severe hip pain,

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.983 align:middle line:84%
today I came in there
with crutches just barely

00:44:44.983 --> 00:44:48.653 align:middle line:84%
after being riding in the
airport and, you know,

00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:50.622 align:middle line:84%
through the airports
and wheelchairs.

00:44:50.622 --> 00:44:53.858 align:middle line:84%
Woman trying to push me up
some steep ramps and struggling

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:57.762 align:middle line:84%
and just giving their
hearts and-- if you don't--

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:00.131 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell myself a story
that life should be different

00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:04.068 align:middle line:84%
than it is, and therefor where I
am is exactly how it should be.

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:09.207 align:middle line:84%
And as far as somebody
that's been injured I know

00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:14.579 align:middle line:84%
that once I was in a very bad
car accident I can just barely

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:17.382 align:middle line:84%
crawl out, I got to the
side of the road and I knew

00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:20.351 align:middle line:84%
that if there was going to
be any injury in my body,

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:23.154 align:middle line:84%
it was being imprinted at he
level of energy of the moment

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of the collision, and that
was such a deeper energy

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:84%
than my ordinary state
that I took myself back

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.496 align:middle line:84%
through soft breathing,
bigger and bigger,

00:45:31.496 --> 00:45:33.531 align:middle line:84%
more and more expansive
till I felt I was

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:38.036 align:middle line:84%
in the exact same state as
where did the impact took place

00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:39.771 align:middle line:90%
and I had my body just release,

00:45:39.771 --> 00:45:42.073 align:middle line:84%
anything that it
might have taken

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.274 align:middle line:90%
on at the moment of impact.

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:45.009 align:middle line:90%
The policemen say, "Are you OK?"

00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:47.512 align:middle line:84%
I suggest I just need
a few more minutes.

00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And then after that it
was just a little bit

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.815 align:middle line:90%
of massage, and chiropractic.

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:54.719 align:middle line:84%
Yet the car was totaled, I was
upside down in the back seat

00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:59.524 align:middle line:84%
where my front seat had been--
it didn't exist anymore.

00:45:59.524 --> 00:46:02.227 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there was a
good deal of fortune in that,

00:46:02.227 --> 00:46:05.663 align:middle line:84%
but I also knew that--
that the-- the--

00:46:05.663 --> 00:46:08.333 align:middle line:84%
the trauma takes place
at a particular level

00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and I know how
to put myself back to that level

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:13.304 align:middle line:90%
and release the trauma.

00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:15.573 align:middle line:84%
That can be taught to people
and I do it all the time.

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:16.808 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: My goodness, wow.

00:46:16.808 --> 00:46:18.176 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: All the time.

00:46:18.176 --> 00:46:19.911 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Wow, that's a-- that's
an amazing story to be able

00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:90%
to go even many, many years

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.816 align:middle line:84%
after an accident would have
happened and that's incredible.

00:46:24.816 --> 00:46:27.285 align:middle line:84%
All right so you talked
a little bit earlier

00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:28.686 align:middle line:90%
about the art of listening.

00:46:28.686 --> 00:46:31.623 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
this video that talks about how

00:46:31.623 --> 00:46:34.392 align:middle line:84%
to really actively listen,
this is a beautiful piece.

00:46:34.392 --> 00:46:38.496 align:middle line:84%
I want-- I want you all
to take a look at this.

00:46:38.496 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I just want
to share a few--

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
just a few simple
things as a gift,

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.774 align:middle line:84%
something that I keep
practicing and keep learning.

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:53.778 align:middle line:84%
About listening, about how
we are present for each other

00:46:53.778 --> 00:46:56.915 align:middle line:90%
in conversation, how we listen.

00:46:56.915 --> 00:47:02.654 align:middle line:84%
So the first and it's
really obvious pay attention

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:08.159 align:middle line:84%
to what's someone saying
and wait till they finish.

00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:12.463 align:middle line:84%
Wail till you have a sense
they've completed their thought,

00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:15.133 align:middle line:90%
even check, you know.

00:47:15.133 --> 00:47:17.936 align:middle line:90%
Did you finish?

00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:21.506 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to talk
over another person.

00:47:21.506 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to try to complete
their sentences, it's-- it--

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.846 align:middle line:84%
it's this tendency many of
us have to think we know

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:31.816 align:middle line:90%
where someone else is going.

00:47:31.816 --> 00:47:34.485 align:middle line:84%
What changes when you listen
in this way is the field

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:38.256 align:middle line:90%
of the relationship itself.

00:47:38.256 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:84%
When you have really heard
someone and you wait for them

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.697 align:middle line:84%
to finish, sometimes
what you would have said

00:47:45.697 --> 00:47:47.532 align:middle line:90%
if you would spoken right on top

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.168 align:middle line:84%
of them isn't even
necessary anymore.

00:47:50.168 --> 00:47:53.304 align:middle line:84%
And you can bring something
that's completely fresh.

00:47:53.304 --> 00:47:55.006 align:middle line:84%
Or you bring something
that really adds

00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:58.376 align:middle line:90%
to what the other person said.

00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:02.413 align:middle line:84%
So try to just be very,
very conscious of the habit

00:48:02.413 --> 00:48:04.615 align:middle line:84%
of talking over people
or the habit

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.651 align:middle line:90%
of completing their sentences.

00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.587 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of a
problem sometimes men have

00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:11.789 align:middle line:90%
with their women.

00:48:13.358 --> 00:48:20.665 align:middle line:84%
Second thing is when we are
listening from early childhood,

00:48:20.665 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:90%
we have listened to see whether

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.069 align:middle line:84%
or not what someone
is saying is going

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:27.205 align:middle line:84%
to threaten us or
be good for us.

00:48:27.205 --> 00:48:32.844 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be judged or put
in a negative sense or praised?

00:48:32.844 --> 00:48:37.782 align:middle line:84%
See if you can shift your
listening from agreement,

00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:40.451 align:middle line:84%
the mode of, "Do I
agree or do I not agree

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:42.220 align:middle line:90%
with what this person has said."

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.156 align:middle line:84%
And instead see if
you can listen just

00:48:45.156 --> 00:48:47.125 align:middle line:84%
to what the other
person is saying.

00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:51.963 align:middle line:84%
See if you can again
sense the difference

00:48:51.963 --> 00:48:56.167 align:middle line:84%
between unconsciously listening
for agreement or disagreement.

00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:59.337 align:middle line:84%
If they agree you're
safe and you add to it.

00:48:59.337 --> 00:49:02.807 align:middle line:84%
If you disagree then you have
to take a different position

00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:06.277 align:middle line:84%
and maybe defend yourself or
find the fault of the flaw

00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:08.212 align:middle line:84%
in what the other
person is saying.

00:49:08.212 --> 00:49:11.849 align:middle line:84%
And so what then is the
relationship consecrated

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:13.351 align:middle line:90%
to unconsciously?

00:49:13.351 --> 00:49:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's distrust.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.389 align:middle line:84%
Unconsciously when we
listen for agreement

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:24.529 align:middle line:84%
and disagreement we're listening
for trust and distrust.

00:49:24.529 --> 00:49:28.566 align:middle line:84%
But it's trust and distrust
of another, of a situation,

00:49:28.566 --> 00:49:31.569 align:middle line:84%
it's not a deep sense of
connection to yourself

00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:35.239 align:middle line:84%
where you have trust
intrinsically and independent

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:36.507 align:middle line:90%
of what someone else says.

00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:40.778 align:middle line:84%
So this practice, see
if you can be aware

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:44.682 align:middle line:84%
of whether you are listening
in the mode of agreement

00:49:44.682 --> 00:49:47.952 align:middle line:84%
or disagreement and see if
you can just put it aside.

00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:50.455 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter if you agree.

00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:52.023 align:middle line:84%
What is that other
person saying?

00:49:52.023 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:90%
It's their truth.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.758 align:middle line:90%
It's their perspective.

00:49:53.758 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's their opinion.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.495 align:middle line:84%
Whether you agree
doesn't matter,

00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:84%
whether you disagree
doesn't matter

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.469 align:middle line:84%
if what you want is a
relational field that starts

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:13.044 align:middle line:84%
to support a higher energy,
a deep presence of trust,

00:50:13.044 --> 00:50:17.448 align:middle line:84%
settles process that
arises really within us.

00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:19.417 align:middle line:90%
So these two things, just

00:50:19.417 --> 00:50:23.454 align:middle line:84%
to be conscious let people
finish their sentence really,

00:50:23.454 --> 00:50:30.828 align:middle line:84%
really listen and don't
listen through the filter

00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:33.598 align:middle line:90%
of agreement-disagreement.

00:50:33.598 --> 00:50:35.266 align:middle line:90%
It's an experiment.

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:38.035 align:middle line:90%
What very few of us realizes,

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:41.439 align:middle line:84%
we are inventing the
possibility of intimacy.

00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:45.076 align:middle line:84%
We are inventing a
possibility of relationship.

00:50:45.076 --> 00:50:46.043 align:middle line:90%
There are no fixed rules.

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:48.246 align:middle line:84%
There never have
been fixed rules.

00:50:48.246 --> 00:50:49.881 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
work better than others.

00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:54.185 align:middle line:84%
And as Einstein said, "If you
keep doing the same things over

00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:56.888 align:middle line:84%
and over again and
expect different results,

00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:58.322 align:middle line:90%
that's crazy."

00:50:58.322 --> 00:51:03.227 align:middle line:84%
If we keep listening to others
through the lens agreement

00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:07.465 align:middle line:84%
and disagreement and expect
to have a real sense of trust

00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:11.435 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] an inexplicable
sense of connection to grow

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:14.705 align:middle line:84%
in that relationship,
it will never happen.

00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:17.875 align:middle line:84%
You'll agree with people, those
would be the ones you side with.

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:19.143 align:middle line:90%
You'll disagree with people.

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:21.345 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
you'll polarize with.

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:25.116 align:middle line:84%
And a deeper field that is there
for all of you conversations

00:51:25.116 --> 00:51:29.754 align:middle line:84%
and all of your relationships,
it won't take shape.

00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:32.857 align:middle line:84%
So that's just my little
offering for right now.

00:51:32.857 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So how would one use
a sense of expansiveness

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.629 align:middle line:84%
when they can't pay their
mortgage or can't pay their rent

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:41.833 align:middle line:84%
and looking and the check
is not going to clear?

00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:43.467 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Expansiveness
is only one-half

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:45.636 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to
be really present.

00:51:45.636 --> 00:51:48.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to be focused
and expansive.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.876 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- There's no--
There's no magic bullet

00:51:51.876 --> 00:51:53.344 align:middle line:90%
to paying your bills.

00:51:53.344 --> 00:51:56.514 align:middle line:84%
If yo can't pay your bills, what
lifestyle are you attached to?

00:51:56.514 --> 00:51:59.283 align:middle line:84%
You know, simplify,
simplify, simplify.

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:02.053 align:middle line:84%
A person who lives
in the present more

00:52:02.053 --> 00:52:04.188 align:middle line:90%
and more is filled from within.

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So you need less and
less room without.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.227 align:middle line:84%
I know this personally for
myself 'cause I've chosen

00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:12.296 align:middle line:84%
to not live in a multimillion
dollar house anymore.

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:14.398 align:middle line:84%
To give that away years
ago in a marriage to live

00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:19.203 align:middle line:84%
in something exceptionally
simple, because it's--

00:52:19.203 --> 00:52:22.039 align:middle line:84%
it's just the flowers, that's
the light, it's the tone

00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:24.775 align:middle line:84%
of voice in people
that can fill anyone.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:29.513 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a society that
has created soul-deadening debt,

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and millions even billions
of people worldwide,

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.988 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a choice
to walk away from that.

00:52:36.988 --> 00:52:38.155 align:middle line:90%
And when you do, you have--

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.925 align:middle line:84%
you can't confuse money
with your identity.

00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:44.228 align:middle line:84%
The people that are paid a lot
of money, millions of dollars

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:46.297 align:middle line:84%
from an incorporations
look in a mirror

00:52:46.297 --> 00:52:48.766 align:middle line:84%
and they believe they
deserve that amount of money,

00:52:48.766 --> 00:52:51.969 align:middle line:84%
and if they lose it that's
someone's taking their self away

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:54.071 align:middle line:90%
from them, that's impossible.

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:57.341 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Soul-deadening debt,
that is very powerful word, yes.

00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:58.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:00.845 align:middle line:84%
And don't let yourself
be so deadened by debt.

00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:04.482 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of it, simplify, shrink,
if you can't afford to live

00:53:04.482 --> 00:53:07.351 align:middle line:84%
in a community this expensive
on the income you're making

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.553 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get much out
of your house right now,

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:84%
then move to a community where
you can afford to buy something

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.958 align:middle line:90%
and very modest and simple.

00:53:13.958 --> 00:53:16.394 align:middle line:84%
My life in Ohio, I
couldn't, at this point,

00:53:16.394 --> 00:53:21.098 align:middle line:84%
go back in buy house there, but
I live wonderfully in Colorado.

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:24.201 align:middle line:84%
And the environment is just
as delicious for me, different

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:26.404 align:middle line:90%
but just as the delicious.

00:53:26.404 --> 00:53:28.806 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice you make.

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:30.274 align:middle line:84%
What we have to understand
is we're here

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:32.410 align:middle line:84%
on this planet to
invent ourselves.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.146 align:middle line:84%
That's what spirituality
really is.

00:53:35.146 --> 00:53:38.616 align:middle line:84%
You start out, you're
programmed, you're conditioned,

00:53:38.616 --> 00:53:42.153 align:middle line:84%
you're enculturated, you decide
through your consecration,

00:53:42.153 --> 00:53:44.889 align:middle line:84%
through your practice,
moment by moment the kind

00:53:44.889 --> 00:53:46.891 align:middle line:90%
of human being you want to be.

00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:50.461 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to spend your
life constantly facing this

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:53.464 align:middle line:90%
threat of debt and being in a--

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:56.100 align:middle line:84%
almost perpetual
soul-deadening contraction,

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.936 align:middle line:90%
what a sorry thing to choose.

00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:00.905 align:middle line:84%
And that a society
would build itself

00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:04.075 align:middle line:90%
that way is strange to me.

00:54:04.075 --> 00:54:07.111 align:middle line:84%
But I have chosen
and a lot of people

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:10.081 align:middle line:84%
that I have helped guide
have chosen to live much,

00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:13.484 align:middle line:84%
much simpler lives where
the fulfillment comes

00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:17.822 align:middle line:84%
with this breath with how
I am present to what is

00:54:17.822 --> 00:54:20.324 align:middle line:84%
and that's a much
healthier life.

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:22.293 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You don't say that
from a place of lack.

00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:24.462 align:middle line:84%
You don't say that from
place of victimhood.

00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:27.098 align:middle line:84%
You don't say, "Well, I'm not
making enough money so I have

00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:28.699 align:middle line:90%
to live in this other place."

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:30.901 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I would never say
that to me, because if I said

00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:33.771 align:middle line:84%
that I would make myself
unhappy in the now,

00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:35.473 align:middle line:84%
which is the only
thing that lives.

00:54:35.473 --> 00:54:37.074 align:middle line:90%
The only time we are is now.

00:54:37.074 --> 00:54:41.746 align:middle line:84%
If I said this-- this house
isn't as nice as the other one,

00:54:41.746 --> 00:54:43.948 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's-- if I'm saying, "OK,

00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:84%
there isn't the granite
counter top and below."

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.418 align:middle line:90%
Yes that's factual.

00:54:47.418 --> 00:54:49.487 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm really
saying is, "Well,

00:54:49.487 --> 00:54:52.156 align:middle line:84%
this house doesn't
mirror my importance

00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:53.357 align:middle line:90%
that way the other one did."

00:54:53.357 --> 00:54:56.627 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't waste one
split second on a thought

00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:58.429 align:middle line:90%
that makes my body contract.

00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:02.099 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Gosh, if there is
anything that people get

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:04.935 align:middle line:84%
from this show that
is so important.

00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:07.772 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That is the practice,
transforming your life

00:55:07.772 --> 00:55:10.474 align:middle line:84%
through the power of
presence means I am not going

00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:13.511 align:middle line:84%
to let a future thought or
a past thought or judgment

00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:16.147 align:middle line:84%
of another or a situation
or of a house--

00:55:16.147 --> 00:55:17.548 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Or a conversation.

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:20.684 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- or a conversation or
myself put me into contraction.

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:22.119 align:middle line:84%
And if the people who
are listening said

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:25.456 align:middle line:84%
that that's not possible,
the answer is you hear--

00:55:25.456 --> 00:55:27.992 align:middle line:84%
you heard a man even play a
violin and you by a violin

00:55:27.992 --> 00:55:29.794 align:middle line:90%
and you can't play it at all,

00:55:29.794 --> 00:55:31.929 align:middle line:84%
but 10,000 hours later
you're pretty good

00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:35.099 align:middle line:84%
and 20,000 hours later
you're Yehudi Menuhin.

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:36.066 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So it's practice?

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:37.568 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And practice,
and practice,

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:40.037 align:middle line:84%
this is my path,
I've practiced it.

00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:42.506 align:middle line:84%
I practice it because
when I awakened,

00:55:42.506 --> 00:55:43.641 align:middle line:90%
it didn't just stay there.

00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:46.544 align:middle line:84%
That perfect supernal
bliss didn't stay there.

00:55:46.544 --> 00:55:50.448 align:middle line:84%
I went back and started
judging my marriage partner.

00:55:50.448 --> 00:55:52.616 align:middle line:84%
I started being distrusting
of people.

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:54.251 align:middle line:90%
I-- My old ego patterns,

00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:56.954 align:middle line:84%
my competitiveness they
reasserted themselves.

00:55:56.954 --> 00:56:02.726 align:middle line:84%
I had to say, "OK, why when
I'm working and I'm so clear,

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:04.528 align:middle line:84%
then I go home and
I creat conflict.

00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:06.797 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I saw it, when
I'm working, I'm in the now.

00:56:06.797 --> 00:56:08.632 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my body, I'm listening.

00:56:08.632 --> 00:56:11.836 align:middle line:84%
When I go home I'm in the past
with my psychological dynamics

00:56:11.836 --> 00:56:13.037 align:middle line:90%
from my mother and father.

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:14.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the future with how
I want the relationship

00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:17.508 align:middle line:90%
to be better or how I want more.

00:56:17.508 --> 00:56:19.343 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What if you're tired?

00:56:19.343 --> 00:56:21.312 align:middle line:84%
And in that present
moment you're tired

00:56:21.312 --> 00:56:24.348 align:middle line:84%
and that affects
your relationships.

00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:26.116 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well first of all
people are sleep deprived

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:26.784 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:56:26.784 --> 00:56:27.985 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:56:27.985 --> 00:56:29.386 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But the reason
they're sleep deprived is

00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:32.490 align:middle line:84%
because every thought all day
long arouses them with anxiety,

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:36.694 align:middle line:84%
with stress, with guilt, with
shame, with anger, with anger,

00:56:36.694 --> 00:56:40.464 align:middle line:84%
with anger, with anger, you
know, impatience, frustra--

00:56:40.464 --> 00:56:44.201 align:middle line:84%
And nervous system is so
exhausted from that kind of--

00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:45.402 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:46.604 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- adrenaline over,
that's why [inaudible]--

00:56:46.604 --> 00:56:47.872 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Fatigue it's
so huge, yes.

00:56:47.872 --> 00:56:49.907 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Fatigue is so
huge in our world.

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:51.642 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of fatigue means--

00:56:51.642 --> 00:56:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.378 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- that you are
poisoning yourself all day long

00:56:54.378 --> 00:56:57.281 align:middle line:84%
and you have to take
a rest, stop doing it,

00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.949 align:middle line:84%
take a practice,
start living it.

00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:00.084 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Into the present moment.

00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:01.819 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, and
comeback to the now,

00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:04.788 align:middle line:84%
because when I'm tired I sleep
like a log and it's like a cat

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.525 align:middle line:84%
that just lays down and
spends-- spends, you know--

00:57:07.525 --> 00:57:08.526 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: The afternoon in the sun.

00:57:08.526 --> 00:57:09.059 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:57:09.059 --> 00:57:10.094 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:11.495 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And-- And I'm
almost never tired

00:57:11.495 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:84%
from emotion overload, not even
if I have traveled all day long

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:18.102 align:middle line:84%
and work with the group of a
hundred people for four hours,

00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:20.371 align:middle line:84%
it does-- 'cause I'm not
telling myself a story.

00:57:20.371 --> 00:57:21.805 align:middle line:84%
The end of the day
my [inaudible].

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.274 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You're not drained, yeah.

00:57:23.274 --> 00:57:25.409 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I am drained,
but it's healthy.

00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:27.144 align:middle line:84%
I worked all day, why
shouldn't I be tired?

00:57:27.144 --> 00:57:28.012 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:57:28.012 --> 00:57:30.381 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know,
well, I'm sleep.

00:57:30.381 --> 00:57:31.382 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: This is beautiful.

00:57:31.382 --> 00:57:33.417 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful, wonderful.

00:57:33.417 --> 00:57:36.287 align:middle line:84%
We just spend the last hour
talking about the juiciness

00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:39.423 align:middle line:84%
of the present moment in
that expansiveness rather

00:57:39.423 --> 00:57:41.025 align:middle line:90%
than in contraction.

00:57:41.025 --> 00:57:42.359 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:43.627 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Thank you so much.

00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:45.162 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: For the dose of
energy we got throughout this

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:46.263 align:middle line:90%
beautiful hour.

00:57:46.263 --> 00:57:48.532 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you felt
a little of that too.

00:57:48.532 --> 00:57:52.036 align:middle line:84%

replay of the interview just go

00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:55.940 align:middle line:90%

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.274 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And until next time.

00:57:57.274 --> 00:58:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I invite you to stay inspired.
