00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: What would our
world look like if there

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:90%
was a healer in every home?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the vision of Master
Chunyi Lin, the founder

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of Spring Forest Qigong.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Master Lin did not become a
renowned healer and teacher

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:10%
His journey began
as a young child

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:10%
during the very difficult
and violent time

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:10%
of the Cultural Revolution
in his native home in China.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And through his personal
story of healing himself

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:10%
of physical challenges
and deep emotional wounds,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:10%
he wants to teach the world
that everyone is born a healer.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And now Chunyi Lin has
led over 300,000 people

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to find their own
inner peace and healing

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:90%
through Spring Forest Qigong.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHUNYI LIN: Yes, thank you.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.238 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a true honor.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: This is my great pleasure
and honor to be here with you.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.413 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is going
to be fantastic.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to hear
about your childhood

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:84%
so we can learn a
little bit about how

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:90%
you were raised in China.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:10%
>>LIN: Oh, OK.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.076 align:middle line:10%
Oh, so I grow up in China.

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:10%
In 1992, that was the first
time when I came to the United

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:10%
States on an AFS program.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So in this 35 years
living in China,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I went through one of
the darkest periods

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
in the history of China--

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Cultural Revolution.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And lots of things happen,
especially in my family.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And that really,
really suffer so much.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I read your
book born a healer.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you and
your brothers and sisters,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and there were
five of you, right?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Four.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.307 align:middle line:84%
Total together, we have a
four brothers and sisters.

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your parents,
you were separated

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
from your parents very young?

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so again
because at the time,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:84%
when Cultural
Revolution started,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
we were living in
a fishing village.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
It was a very small town.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And we thought the Cultural
Revolution would not

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:90%
touch that part of the world.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually, every part of
the world was being touched.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And then there's two
gangs in the country--

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they both said that they
support the government

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and they were loyal to Mao.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't
agree with each other

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:10%
in some political
opinions and ended up

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:10%
they fought with weapons.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And my parents did
not agree with them,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
so they were the target
to put into jail.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And so then we got separated.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
was eight years old.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eight years old.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, eight years old.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you were the oldest.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, I was the oldest.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so your younger
brothers and sisters,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%
you had to basically flee with.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From house to house.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And from
what I read, you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
experienced such deception from
people that you really trusted.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people,
my parents helped them.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they were in
difficulties, when the Cultural

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Revolution started,
you know, they

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
put their devoted friends kids
into their mouth of a wolf.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And they even, at a
point, they wanted to kill us.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So that really, really
put me really down.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why later on, I
developed suicidal depression.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And for so many years I
really wanted to end my life.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
When people now in
my classes, they

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:84%
see me teaching, smiling,
happy all the time.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I told
them my story, they

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
said, did you really
have depression?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.097 align:middle line:90%
I say yes I did.

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You had every reason to.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every reason to.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean from being
bounced around to having

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
a gun put in your face.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.685 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nobody
wanted to take you

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
in because they had
shamed the family, right?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you had a
lot of forgiveness to do.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And also I play basketball.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I graduated
from high school,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.795 align:middle line:84%
at the time, the
whole country, kids

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
who graduated from
high school were

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
forced to go to the countryside
to work as a peasant,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
living with the
farmers and peasants.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So I was there.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This went on for
how many years of your life?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: In the whole
country, for over 10 years.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.208 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over ten years.

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And me, it
was like five years.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So because of that very hard
to labor work 16 hours a day--

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As a teenager.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.863 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, as a teenager.

00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the fields.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: In the fields.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of injuries
in my back, in my neck.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I had bone
spurs in my neck.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I had bone spurs in my back
and arthritis in my knees.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:84%
As a young man, I was
in very bad shape.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Everybody
must have been.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yeah.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Plus the
emotional suppression.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
fear and the danger.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yeah.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did
you bridge the gap?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
When did that start
to end for you?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So one more
thing I want to share

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
with you is to note that finally
during the Cultural Revolution,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
we escaped out from the town
and we lived with my grandma

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
on my mother's side.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So I witness that one of
my uncle's wife father,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because he was having water
buffalo before the liberation,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
then he was considered
as a rich man.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, he was
literally, during the Cultural

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Revolution, by the gang, took
him to the field and dug a hole

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and buried him alive.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because he had--

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Buried him alive.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because he had money and
it was against the government?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: That's what
the government said.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And then when he was
buried up to the shoulder,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
then the gang use the machine
gun to shot him in the head.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So that really got me so deep
into suicidal depression.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
was at the age of 10.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ooh.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And this was the man
you were living with.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And then-- he was an honest man.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:90%
He was a peasant.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So he, at that
time, he was still

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
working in the field
in the summer time.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So the gang drug him
out from the field

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and took him to the public
to receive criticism.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And at the end they
bury him alive.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And he
did nothing wrong?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: He did nothing wrong.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So again-- So I had all
these sufferings, mentally,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, and physically.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.078 align:middle line:84%
So I really, many times,
I wanted to end my life.

00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, of
course, you didn't--

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.575 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not saying that
that was the only solution,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and thank god you didn't,
but your faith in the world.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:90%
had to have gone away.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: It's the one thing,
I wanted to end my life.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I said
to myself, I wanted

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to find out why this
world is so ugly, so ugly.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Because everything I saw
in my eyes was so negative.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And then plus my pain.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to get an
answer to my question

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to satisfy my question
before I moved on in my life.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:90%
So I tried many, many things.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, nothing really, really
helped me to my heart level.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So one day, my
colleague said there was

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:90%
a qigong master coming to town.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
By sitting at his
workshop and very possibly

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
you can heal your
critical situation.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, had the
Cultural Revolution

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:90%
subsided at this point?

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, at that point the
Cultural Revolution was over.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:90%
So I went to his workshop.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I sat on the dirt
ground for seven hours

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and a half, non-stop, no
break time, no bathroom time.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Along with
15,000 people, right?

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, doing qigong on the
dirt ground in a soccer field.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Then so I meditated.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I did the simple movements
together with him,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
following his guidance.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Then in the meditation, he said
if you want to heal yourself

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
faster, you need to
forgive those people who

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time hurt you
so badly in your heart.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I heard
that, I said, no way.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
How could I forgive
those people who

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:84%
when they were in difficulties,
we did everything for them.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And now so for no reason--

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Betrayal.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: --the Cultural
Revolution came and they put us

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:90%
into the mouth of a wolf.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I said
that in my mind,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.765 align:middle line:84%
the master sent
another message saying

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
if you have a hard time to say
I forgive you, you just pretend.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%
You pretend you forgive them.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
By pretending, you can
also get benefit too.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
You can heal yourself faster.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a
minute, by pretending

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.345 align:middle line:84%
I can heal myself faster with my
knees and my back and my neck?

00:10:20.345 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a good deal.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.171 align:middle line:90%

00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So then, through
my visualization,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I visualized lining them up in
the sky, all these people, one

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
by one I said to them,
at this moment I just

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
want to heal myself faster,
so I pretend I forgive you.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I pretend I love you.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know that.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So then I just
repeat, I forgive you.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I pretend I forgive you.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:90%
I pretend I love you.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
After saying that like a mantra,
you know, for 1,000 times.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Then I got tired of
those long words.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And then simply, I just
said, I forgive you.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But that moment, the
tremendous vitality

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
as a heat starting
from my bellybutton

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
radiating out throughout
my entire body.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.065 align:middle line:84%
Then I open my third
eye, I saw the sky.

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It's so open.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so
peaceful, so empty.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
When I came out from
that one meditation,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:90%
my energy got transformed.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: I had the
biggest awakening.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And the swelling in my
knees completely went away.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.585 align:middle line:84%

of amount of time.

short amount of time

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:90%

80% gone.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I was able to jump again.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And the back pain and the neck
pain completely went away.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:90%
I was so happy.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And then every day, I was
practicing the same movement

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:90%
he taught us for two months.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden one day I
realized my suicidal depression

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:90%
also was gone.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

if your heart open--

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I found out when
your heart open,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
you see the world differently.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:84%
This is what Buddha
call enlightenment.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Up to I had that
big awakening, when

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd look at those people
who hurt my family

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and me in the past, I was
able to think in this way.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
At that time, if
they didn't do that,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:84%
the government might
go after them too,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
then we have more
people to suffer.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you
know, this may not

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.825 align:middle line:84%
be a bad thing for us to take

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, when I
practice healing and teaching,

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I found out because of my
pain, because of my suffering,

I understand it.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%

Whatever we have

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
you can see inside you.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
ask me, you know,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest blockage
in our body, disconnections.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at outside and
people do not trust each other.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The government, one
country to another,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:90%
do not trust each other.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
a boundary, right?

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So you create that disconnection
between you and the nature,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
between you and the
people, even in a family.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And this shows up
in our body, too.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:84%
When you have this
disconnection in countries,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of conflicts
is going to happen.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And when this
conflicts continues,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
then chronic problems
get created, right?

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And here in our body, too,
when our kidney energy doesn't

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:90%
talk to the heart energy.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The heart energy doesn't
talk to the lungs energy.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.478 align:middle line:84%

what qigong does

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%

people ask me, when an article
in Pioneer newspaper in St.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
there was a lady who was

situation.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Mayo Clinic wanted
her to have a lung transplant

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
because the lungs just filled
up with the scar tissues.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Esther Trejo.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't want to do that.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And her son who knew a
little bit about Tai Chi

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
heard about what I was
doing in the high school,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
so he brought his
mom to my class.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.157 align:middle line:84%
She practiced the

00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:90%

you need to go to learn
Chinese breathing.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%

her son, she said,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I have been breathing
for 60 years.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't need somebody from
other side of the world

But she was there.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
She learned the exercise.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And in the class,
I did healing, too.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:84%

And then eight weeks later, she
went back to the Mayo Clinic.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The Mayo Clinic doctor said,
we don't know what you did.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
All the lung scar
tissues disappear,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%

oxygen anymore.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%

people can get this huge
benefit with the healing.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Then I started searching around.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So I followed different
masters in the country.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And go to Sichuan go to Shaolin,
go to many, many other places

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:90%
to learn from different masters.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And also I did a
lot of readings,

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
too, through ancient
documents in how this qi work

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and how you can apply this qi to
help yourself and help others.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Then I discover that this qi,
it is so simple and so powerful.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
trust yourself,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you activate it and put your
unconditional love in action

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
to use it help yourself
and help others.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It is just so powerful.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So then through a lot of
studies through so many masters,

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I greatly, greatly
appreciate that.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But their teaching, most
of them are so complicated.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And some masters, their
healing power was so powerful.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had some
healing with them.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced
first hand with them.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they were just so awesome.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: But when I
asked him, how quickly

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I can learn these techniques.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Some said 10 years and 20 years.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And the last one I went
to, he said 50 years.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I-- I paused in my heart.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a minute,
you know, 50 years?

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have patience,
but I don't have time.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But from one thing
I really recognized

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:84%
something inside myself
is, at that time,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I was not even a
qigong practitioner.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I practiced Tai Chi, but
not a qigong practitioner.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But in one meditation,
seven hours and a half,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I was able to cure my knees, my
back, my neck, the bone spurs.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I cure myself,
my depression,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:90%
suicidal depression.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So it got to be
something very simple.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I follow my heart.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And finally, I found it.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why I developed
Spring Forest qigong.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It is so simple.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And by doing these
simple movements,

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you are able to activate
the power, the qi,

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:90%
we call it the qi, from inside.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
the difference of--

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you took this complex system
with these great masters,

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't
duplicatable, you really

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
couldn't duplicate what
these great masters had done.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.267 align:middle line:84%
So Spring Forest qigong uses
the five elements, right?

00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Right, right.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.558 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
tell us about that?

00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the five
elements because our body,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
our system, according
to the Chinese medicine

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese qigong
practice, there's

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
a total together of
five energetic systems

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.522 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:28:48.522 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:90%
The liver, that's the wood.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Heart is the fire.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And the stomach is the earth.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:90%
The lungs is the metal.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And the kidney, the vitality
system, that's the water.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
These five elements,
they support each other.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:84%
They must work in
harmony so that you can

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:90%
create the wholeness in a body.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:17.060 align:middle line:84%
When the balance, the
connection is there,

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:90%
then health is restored.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Or you can maintain
happy and healthy.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, now, this is a
unique thing of qigong.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
qigong helps you, through
this simple movement,

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:84%
to wake up the awareness of
these connections inside.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Then you bring harmony back.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can go through
the heart and the liver

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and the stomach and scan
our bodies, basically,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:84%
for where there
might be blockages?

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And actually you
don't need to do that.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So in the five elements healing
movement exercise, the qigong

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:90%
movement, I have five movements.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The first movement, you move
your hands in a certain way.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.842 align:middle line:84%
And then you say in
your mind, I'm happy.

00:30:07.842 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We did that,
which was wonderful.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so
we just did that.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And then to get from
there, you move to joy.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Joy, the vibration of
joy, goes to the heart.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And then so you
invite the joyfulness.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:10%
You just feel--
say to your mind.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to really feel
it, you just say in your mind,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm so joyful today.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm in joy, joy, joy.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: By repeating
this, your mind,

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.100 align:middle line:84%
your body is going to be in sync
producing that kind of energy

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
to help you.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Scientific studies already
done a lot of studies

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
about how powerful
our mind will be.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Whenever you
say, you know, your mind

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:84%
is going to produce
the energy for you.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
like to do a finger growing

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.680 align:middle line:90%
game with you.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: All right, this is a
very fun thing, all right?

00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So now, I want
you to do in this way.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find the
first line in the bottom

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:90%
of the palm in the left hand.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And then go to the right hand
and match these two lines

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And then close
your hands and see

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
which hand your finger
is a little bit longer

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Like your
left hand, all right.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So now you put up your right
hand and just close our eyes,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
say in your mind, my fingers are
growing longer, longer, longer,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%
longer, longer.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I really feel my fingers are
growing longer, longer, longer,

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:90%
longer, longer.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And now open your eyes, put
these two lines together,

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and compare your hands.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.202 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:31:45.202 --> 00:31:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Do you see that?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, a lot longer.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the power of the mind?

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: This is the
power of the mind.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I share this in my classes.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So if within 30
seconds or 10 seconds,

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
you are able to grow your
fingers that much, how

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
about when your body
has an energy blockage?

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
You invited to transform.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:11.773 align:middle line:90%
It is all about transforming.

00:32:11.773 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a wonderful
way of saying that.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an invitation to transform.

>>LIN: Invitation.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Invitation.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Rather
than getting stuck

00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
in the fear of the blockage,
it's an opportunity to heal.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yes, once you say that
aloud in your mind, I'm happy,

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm filled with
joy, then your body

00:32:28.085 --> 00:32:31.970 align:middle line:84%
is going to produce that
kind of energy to help you.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then from happiness
to joy, and then you

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:90%
flow into peacefulness.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the stomach energy.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You feel, I'm so in peace,
connecting to the universe,

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the earth.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And once you feel
the peacefulness,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
this peacefulness
energy, the vibration

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:58.370 align:middle line:84%

stomach, your digestive system,

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:90%
your spleen.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:10%
to the upper chest and your
left hand to the lower stomach.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.300 align:middle line:90%
The palms face the body.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Your hands do not
touch your body.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a column of light
in the center of your torso.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Place your tongue against
the roof of your mouth.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Bend your knees.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, just start moving
the yin and yang

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
energies in the following way.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Your right hand
moves out and down,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
while your left hand
moves in and up.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The right hand moves down
to the bottom of the torso,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
while the left hand
moves up to the face.

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Your hands continue moving
in this elliptical pattern.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Use your elbows to
guide the movement.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:84%
And use your hands
to feel the energy.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Your hands move at the rate
of three to five cycles

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.719 align:middle line:90%
per minute.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Make sure, when you
do this movement,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:90%
your fingers stay open.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
When your fingers are open,
you'll receive energy better.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:84%
When your fingers close, you
close your energy channels.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, visualize
the universal energy

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:84%
coming into your body
from all over your body.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Now visualize the
energy collecting

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in the lower dantian, which
is deep in behind the navel.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
When you exhale, visualize
the extra energy in your body,

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
any pain or sickness
changing into a smoke

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and shooting out from
every part of your body

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to the ends of the universe.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Bring happiness
energy into your body.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:90%


00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Just say, I feel happy.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I feel so happy.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Heaven's energy is flowing
into me and feeling me up.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that
you use these motions

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:90%
with the affirmations.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And the visuals really
help on the video

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to see and to visualize
what is happening.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you suggest that for us?

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When you do so,
you have the image,

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:84%
how the energy
flow into your body

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you can create the
environment inside you.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And especially when you see
the pictures of the nature,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.190 align:middle line:84%
you bring in the nature,
the universal energy

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to come in to help you,
that's even more powerful.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's do some
exercises, if we can,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and address some issues
that people might have.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
suffer from headaches,

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and even as severe as migraines.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Sure.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What can we do?

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, so qigong--

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.980 align:middle line:84%
first of all, qigong
is for everybody.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So it is not
just for a certain group

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of people, all right, like in
yoga and Tai Chi all right?

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
talk a little bit

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
about what's the difference
between Tai Chi and Yoga.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Tai Chi is boxing.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a martial art.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:84%
In ancient time, you
know, Chinese people

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:84%
use it to fight, to
protect yourself.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But it practiced
with slow motions.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And coming to nowadays, so
we use it as relaxation.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:90%
It is very good for balance.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But the mindset
of Tai Chi is not

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.340 align:middle line:84%
for healing at the
very beginning.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: It is for fighting.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is for people
who are healthy.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you are
healthy, you practice

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:84%
these to prepare
yourself for deepening

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual practice, going
deep into your meditation

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:90%
to reach enlightenment.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can also
get healthier through yoga.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yes.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Healing is
the side effect

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of doing the yoga meditation
or spiritual enlightenment.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And qigong, many,
many forms of qigong

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
were developed by those
people who were sick

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:84%
or the doctors who want to
help the sick people to heal.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So at the very beginning, qigong
is for healing, for longevity.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go deeper
with the qigong practice,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.210 align:middle line:90%
that is the spiritual growth.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the qigong
movements, it's so simple.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You repeat the same
movements again and again

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and again and again until you
get into the mode of quietness.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And so in the quietness,
you are wakening up

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:90%
the life intelligence.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Chinese call it the qi.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The qi.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And this qi
can help you to fix

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.360 align:middle line:90%
any problems in the body.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the fact that
it also aids with longevity.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
moving the energy,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the life force, and it continues
to help you stay young and look

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.090 align:middle line:90%
younger and feel younger.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yes, exactly.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So healing pain, that is
a very, very simple thing

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:90%
in qigong practice.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So through the movements
you just did, and, you know,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:84%
the gratitude
movements, this can

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
help you to balance your
energy, balance your system

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to bring the harmony
back to your body

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:90%
so that you will have no pain.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You will have no any other
challenges in the body.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: All right.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to really focus
on helping my pain right now,

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:90%
first of all, like headaches.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.215 align:middle line:90%

00:40:03.193 --> 00:40:05.330 align:middle line:90%
a couple very simple movements.

Oh, yeah.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's the qigong thing.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.502 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:40:14.502 --> 00:40:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So you use
your thumb, to find,

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to travel along the supporting
bone of the index finger

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to the dimple of the bone
at the end over here.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And there's an energy point.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:33.260 align:middle line:90%
You just massage it.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Push it deep and massage
it and you visualize

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.200 align:middle line:90%
light getting into this point.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Or simply you just say, light
shooting into this area.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you say in your
mind, my head ache gone.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I am completely healed.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
My headache is gone, I
am completely healed.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
You massage it for like
a two or three minutes,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
you will feel the energy in
your head start opening up.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:90%
bones, the eyebrows here.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, the bones, yes.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: And then down here.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: You make it in this way.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And massage in a circular, like
half circle way, all right?

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: And massage in this way.

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So it really adds the
circulation to the eyes.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So other time when I went to
a middle school, high school,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:90%
we did not need glasses at all.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: You know,
and now people--

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:84%
because every day
during the break time,

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:19.840 align:middle line:84%
we had the loudspeaker to,
all over the school every kid,

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840 align:middle line:90%
doing this movement.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, to
prevent eye problems.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eye strain.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So and now
we don't do that.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why the people
have a very good business.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We stare at our
screens on our phones instead.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: You know, they are
selling glasses, right?

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And wonder why our
eyes get bad after 40.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so by doing,
so like, you know--

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.310 align:middle line:90%
so we have clients--

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:50.358 align:middle line:84%
just by doing so, the floatings
in the eyes disappear.

00:42:50.358 --> 00:42:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: And so I am 61 years old.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:55.682 align:middle line:90%
I don't need glasses.

00:42:55.682 --> 00:42:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh, that's--

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: I know.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:84%
When I go to the most
expensive restaurants,

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:90%
I can still read the menu.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can see
the small print.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what I
discover, the more expensive

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the restaurant is,
darker the room is.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, in that
darkness, you can't see.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to try this
before I read a menu.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, you do it like
two or three times a day.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And each time take
like five minutes.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:90%
It helps you tremendously.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It not only helps
you with your eyes,

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
it helps you to balance
the energy in your brain.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It helps you with
migraine headaches,

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
sinuses problems, a
lot of great things.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have a
clinic in Minnesota.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And you said you see
about 40 patients a day?

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: That's only in my list.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: I know.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So literally every
day we have 100 people

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.947 align:middle line:90%
walk through our healing center.

00:43:54.947 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:00.130 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest issue
that your patients have,

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:90%
if you could say?

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so
I think stresses.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.275 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So in my list, like 75%
of my people are cancer people.

00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:11.075 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:11.075 --> 00:44:13.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So I help
a lot of people.

00:44:13.015 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To move the energy.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.223 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: To move the energy.

00:44:15.223 --> 00:44:18.415 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So we share with them how
to do these movements.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We coach them how
to do the qigong,

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and we also literally
do healing on them.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And we help to scan the
energy blockages in the body,

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
find out where exactly there is
an energy blockage in the body.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Without touching the body, OK?

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the qigong technique.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we send
out energy to help

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:90%
to clear the energy blockages.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And like aches and pains,
just within seconds the pain

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.270 align:middle line:90%
can go away.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:53.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's incredible.

00:44:53.353 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And what about the cancer?

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: The cancer,
we do the same.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We give them a very
detailed instruction

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:84%
on how to do the movements
and how many hours every day

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:90%
for how many days.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like a
prescription, essentially.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, we have a
program to help them.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It gives people action.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Other than just
sitting and waiting

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.780 align:middle line:84%
for the disease
and the medicine,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.350 align:middle line:84%
you give people action,
which is wonderful.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So before I came
over here on yesterday

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.130 align:middle line:84%
after I finished
seeing some people,

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.520 align:middle line:84%
there's this one girl who was
diagnosed with thyroid cancer

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and spread to the
other part of the body.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:84%
She did not want to do
the traditional healing,

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.250 align:middle line:90%
the treatment.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So she practiced these
movements two months

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and plus the healing
in the center.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And so a few days ago, she
went to the Mayo Clinic

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:90%
to do a follow-up.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And yesterday she call.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:84%
She called me, she said,
all the tumors gone.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, what an
amazing phone call to get.

00:46:07.045 --> 00:46:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, I know.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's incredible.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:84%
What about issues
like back pain?

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Can we address that?

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people--

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
pain management is
such a huge industry.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: I know.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But in qigong, it
is just so simple.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
these movements I'm

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:84%
going to share with
you, number one,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:84%
prevent pains in upper back,
middle back, or lower back.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Or if you do have a
pain in those areas,

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:84%
by massaging these
areas, you can help

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:90%
to balance it very quickly.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So for the lower
back pain, all right,

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:84%
the energy point in
between the supporting bone

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of the little finger and
then the ring finger,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where these two bones join,
the end over here on the back,

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and you massage
this energy point.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:06.445 align:middle line:84%
And you stick your finger
inside to massage it.

00:47:06.445 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ooh, that is sore, yes.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: That means
you have blockage.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I sit a lot, yes.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And you
massage it clockwise.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And do it like between one
minute to two to three minutes.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And you say in
your mind, my back

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.750 align:middle line:90%
is completely back to normal.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.260 align:middle line:84%
All the pain is gone,
completely heal.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And you smile, smile, smile.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.653 align:middle line:84%
And that will help
to release the pain.

00:47:31.653 --> 00:47:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it
matter which hand?

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: It doesn't matter.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.797 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or both hands?

00:47:34.797 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Both hands.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.930 align:middle line:90%
So this is for lower back pain.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And for middle back pain,
it's the ring finger and then

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.910 align:middle line:84%
the middle finger where
the supporting bones

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.840 align:middle line:84%
join of these two fingers
meet, this is the energy point.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: And you massage.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: And this in my book
"Head to Toe Healing."

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: All right, so again,
you massage it deeply.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
gentleman came in

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.310 align:middle line:84%
with very, very
painful back pain.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And he sit down.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, this pain
is going to kill me.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.470 align:middle line:90%
So he complained.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's just terrible.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: So I said, well,
give me your hand.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So I touched this point,
just within one minute,

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:90%

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
When people ask me, do you
know how painful it is?

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I say I know because
I was there before.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, that's why
I'm so passionate learning

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:45.220 align:middle line:84%
these techniques from my
masters to share with the world.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
about how you did heal that
crushing back pain that you

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.480 align:middle line:90%
literally were crushed.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yes, so
again, I did qigong.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I practiced those
simple movements just

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.310 align:middle line:90%
like what you did.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Then also, I travel
around the country

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to learn how we can help the
body in a simple and powerful

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.510 align:middle line:90%
way to heal your body.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:90%
So this is my mission.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:90%
That's why I have--

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.207 align:middle line:84%
in my meditation, actually,
I was given this message

00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:21.790 align:middle line:84%
about healing in
every home in a world

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.590 align:middle line:90%
without pain and suffering.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.562 align:middle line:90%
And I stay with us.

00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is your mission.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, this is my mission.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And born
a healer, you're

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.160 align:middle line:84%
basically saying that
we all have this ability

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.220 align:middle line:90%
to heal ourselves.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Right.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And maybe
even heal others.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Oh, yes.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I have other
programs from level one,

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.080 align:middle line:84%
level two, level
three, level four.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And we teach people
how to heal themselves

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and how to send out energy
with love to heal others.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.070 align:middle line:90%
And we have so many stories.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:01.120 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of teachers,
you know, all over the world

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.190 align:middle line:90%
teaching Spring Forest qigong.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple of
thousand practice groups

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:90%
all over the world doing qigong.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a movement.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I want
you, if you can,

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.470 align:middle line:90%
take a look at this next video.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It will really help you
connect with your heart

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and spread that
healing to others.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And do this along with us again.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Adjust your feet so you
are now standing with your feet

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.870 align:middle line:90%
shoulder width apart.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Put your hands
together palm to palm

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.950 align:middle line:10%
in front of your chest
putting a little pressure

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:41.880 align:middle line:10%
on your fingertips to keep
stimulating your heart energy.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:51.650 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, slowly
bend forward at the waist.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.280 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale,
straighten back up.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Continue moving in this
way slowly and gently.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Continue putting some pressure
on the tips of your fingers

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.880 align:middle line:84%
as you press your
fingertips together.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Now tapped into the
limitless energy of gratitude

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and thankfulness in the
universe in a way that

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
is most comfortable for you,
or just say, I am so thankful.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The energy of thankfulness and
gratitude is flowing into me

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and filling me up.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Say it out loud or
say it in your mind

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.100 align:middle line:90%
and know it is happening.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy of
thankfulness and gratitude

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.790 align:middle line:90%
flowing through your body.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Feel thankfulness
in every breath.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Feel thankfulness
in every thought.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Feel thankfulness in your soul.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Feel thankfulness flowing
into every cell of your body.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You can direct this energy
to flow into any area

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:15.050 align:middle line:84%
where you have a special
need or challenge.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Think of something
you are thankful for

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and express your gratitude.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.477 align:middle line:84%

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me how
you can use qigong

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:32.050 align:middle line:84%
with emotional damage

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:90%
are very challenging.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Aha.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I created Five
Elements healing movement.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time in
the qigong world in history,

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I put five elements with
five different emotions,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.670 align:middle line:84%
happy emotions, positive
emotions into the movements.

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's
intentionally connected.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yes.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: You might say, you
know, I'm not a happy person.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I have no reason to be
happy at all because I

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.130 align:middle line:90%
had this happen, that happen.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I had accidents and now
my body is in a mess.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.810 align:middle line:90%
My family is in a mess.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.490 align:middle line:90%
You know, I got my children.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want
to talk about them.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, because you have been
living in that environment

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:27.190 align:middle line:84%
for so long and you forgot
there's a happiness.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have
that awakening.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.210 align:middle line:90%
So how to do that?

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
really happy to say

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that I'm happy today.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, for instance,
when you do the movement,

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.710 align:middle line:84%
you just let go with everything
and focus at this moment

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in order to heal
yourself faster,

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:53.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to invite the pain
or tumors to go away faster.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You just say in
your mind, telling

00:53:56.770 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:84%
your lungs, your breast,
your liver, your intestines,

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.350 align:middle line:84%
your knees, your hands, your
fingers, I'm happy today.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.230 align:middle line:84%

And my mother has a
hard time with it.

00:54:16.918 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Because she doesn't
know the outcome.

And every day she
tries something new.

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:84%

What do you really
want, all right?

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So people are getting
angry with things or get

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.480 align:middle line:90%
so frustrated with things.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they are
crying for happiness.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.670 align:middle line:90%
They are crying for love.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But they make it in
a different approach.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They could make it better.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So by recognizing

I am and this is what I
want, I want happiness living

>>LISA: The middle?

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:26.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so you
hold your fingers--

00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:28.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot is in the palm.

00:56:28.133 --> 00:56:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Our hands is so powerful because
our hands connected directly

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:90%
to our heart.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's the power.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that makes sense.

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so
again, for instance,

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:45.630 align:middle line:84%
we have 12 major energy
meridians in the body.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And four meridians connect
directly to the heart.

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They are all arranged
in the hands.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.257 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: That's why our

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.007 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: Yeah, so
again, what you do

00:57:00.007 --> 00:57:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is where the middle

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.930 align:middle line:84%
if your fingers, you don't have
any injuries in the fingers,

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:84%
you just curve your
middle finger naturally

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.870 align:middle line:84%
down where the middle
finger touches.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.175 align:middle line:90%
That is the energy point.

00:57:14.175 --> 00:57:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's where
the energy point is.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Then you massage.

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: You massage here
and take deep breath.

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.030 align:middle line:84%
That will help to
calm down the anxiety

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and calm down the anxiousness
and even calm down

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:33.050 align:middle line:90%
the anger and hatred.

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Yeah, just by this.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.290 align:middle line:90%

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It moves your body
without moving your body.

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.703 align:middle line:84%
>>LIN: You bring that energy
focus back to your heart.

00:57:43.703 --> 00:57:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's
where it's at.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: That's it.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's right.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you move your heart
energy, the rest of your energy

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.315 align:middle line:90%

00:57:50.315 --> 00:57:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LIN: Exactly.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you do

emotional or physical

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.980 align:middle line:90%
blockages.

>>LIN: You know, so this is
the unique thing of qigong.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to see a doctor,
if you don't have a symptom,

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the doctor says I don't

X-ray did not show anything.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't do anything
until you have a tumor

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.110 align:middle line:84%
or have a bone spur
I can help you with.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But qigong, from
the very beginning

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of the blockage in the body,
it's not physically troubling

the body yet, qigong can
help you to find it out

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.240 align:middle line:90%

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:55.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something very
simple you can do.

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:84%

along the spine in the C7.

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
huge energy blockage

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.160 align:middle line:84%
blocking the energy flowing
from the bottom of the torso

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.110 align:middle line:84%
up to top of the head and
going down to the bellybutton,

which, we call it the vitality
center, the lower dantian.

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.800 align:middle line:84%

So then at the very beginning
when I was in China,

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I did qigong as a hobby
for a good 10 years.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I studied qigong when
I was in middle school,

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:01.830 align:middle line:90%
but not very seriously into it.

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I did practice
kung fu and Tai Chi.

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And then until I got
sick, then I really

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
got into qigong
when I was healed.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%

>>LIN: OK.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, qigong, these
techniques have

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
been reserved by our
masters and only taught

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to a few who are very passionate
so that the masters will

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
teach them selflessly.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
They share all this
information with these people.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So I am so lucky to be
chosen by the universe.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So I want to carry
on this message

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
