00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Hi.
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
And welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
Let me ask you a question.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:10%
Would you like to
learn how to accept

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
yourself more in
order to be more

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:10%
confident, and more loving?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a really,
really big question.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:90%
And I want that to settle in.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what spiritual
teacher, Denise Linn,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
teaches through her
powerful story and her

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
over 17 books on living a
spiritually radiant life.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
phrases that comes

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to mind when I-- I hear you
tell your story is, oh my god.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
If you can do
everything that you've

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
done in your life after
what you've been through,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:90%
absolutely anybody can.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And you are such an
inspiration to so many people.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate you being here.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you could, tell
us about when you were

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:90%
a teenager living your life.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Where did you grow up?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Um, most of my life I
grew up here in California.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
But when I was in high
school, we lived in Ohio.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And your parents
were teachers, right?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.665 align:middle line:10%
Well, they were
scientists, actually.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:10%
-Scientists.
-They were both chemists.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I wanted
to be a scientist.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And my brother went on to
become an astrophysicist,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:90%
my sister a marine biologist.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
My other brother got
involved in computers.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
direction of my life

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
as a young teenager and
a high school student.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Um, but the whole
reason, I guess,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I got into the field I'm in now
was a result of an experience

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I had when I was 17 years old.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I-- I had one of those
little motorbikes.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was so excited
with my little motorbike.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tiny,
little town in Ohio.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
It was a farming community.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.095 align:middle line:84%
And I went out when August
afternoon with my motorbike.

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I was 17, as I said.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't realize was
I was being followed by someone

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
who was a man I didn't know,
I hadn't done anything to him

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:90%
and in a kind of isolated area.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:84%
He hit the gas and you rammed
his car into my motorbike,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and he hit it hard.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I flew off the motorbike.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I skidded across the road.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Could you-- did you
know what was happening?

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was obvious
he hit me on purpose.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't understand it.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, I was
just minding my own business.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could remember
watching his car leave.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well
why did he hit me?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched, he
pulled in, turned around

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and he was coming back.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.491 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well he's--
he's coming back to help me.

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
But he--

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So, when you said it's
obvious he hit you on purpose,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.717 align:middle line:90%
was the-- how did you know that?

00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel that?

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Because he pulled his car
right up next to me, and then

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
he turned into me.
-Oh.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was-- he turned
into me hard enough

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
that later some of
the paint from his car

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:90%
was on my little motorbike.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:90%
So he hit it pretty hard.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%
So it--

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.296 align:middle line:90%
So when he turned around--

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm thinking he's
coming back to help me.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But he-- he pulled his
car up alongside me,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and rolled the window down and,
Lisa do you know-- have you

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
ever had those kind of
dramatic experiences

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
in life when they seem
to be going so slow.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
What happened next seemed
like it was in slow motion,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
where he pulled out a gun.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking into
the hole of this gun.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe that
someone is aiming a gun at me.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there was
this loud explosion.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And he had shot me.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
You're-- did you
just-- your brain

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.215 align:middle line:90%
just not be able to handle it.

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:50.991 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- I
couldn't fathom that.

00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean and in the
little tiny farming

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
town in Ohio in
those days, people

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
just didn't shoot each other.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It was very different
than society today.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Very, surreal, oh.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And-- and as I was laying
there, I heard the sound

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
of his car door open and close.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
And then I could hear the sound
of him walking on the gravel.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard the sound
of a zipper going down.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And he cocked the
gun once again.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I opened my eyes, and for
some unknown reason, all

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I felt in that moment.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel afraid.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Which seemed strange.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
A guy just hit me,
and he shot me.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't I be afraid?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Where in your
body were you shot?

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
He shot me in the lower abdomen.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
bounced off my spine,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and ended-- or went through
actually one of the vertebras,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and then lodged up
in one of my lungs.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:90%
So the bullet was still in you?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And were you in an
extraordinary amount of pain?

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary amount of pain.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people said, I've
heard it doesn't get--

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.725 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't hurt to get shot.
It hurts.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:02.456 align:middle line:90%
It really hurts.

00:05:02.456 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Who would say that?

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And evidently,
when he had hit me,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
evidently my spleen
had exploded too.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
hard he'd hit me.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot
of other damage

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:90%
done from being hit by the car.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised you
did not die instantly.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a miracle.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a miracle.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Based on the amount of
damage that you're explaining.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, I lost a spleen.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I lost an adrenaline gland.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I lost a kidney.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I lost a good part of one
of my lungs eventually.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Like I said,
there's a hole still

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
through my spine about the
size of my little finger.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a six-inch tube
replacing the aorta.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I was told I would
never have children.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They took out part of
the small intestine,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:90%
some part of the stomach.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.387 align:middle line:90%
So it was a lot of damage.

00:05:42.387 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you see why I said in
the beginning of the show,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I am amazed that you're
sitting here today

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to talk to me about this.
Incredible.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So you were laying there,
surprisingly alive.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And most likely filled
with so much pain

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and slightly in and
out of consciousness.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.951 align:middle line:84%
But you were still able to
open your eyes and look?

00:05:58.951 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I looked
into his eyes, and I

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
just felt compassion for him.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And go figure.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean I-- you know
maybe-- I have no idea.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment I just
felt a depth of compassion.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to shoot me.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could watch almost
this internal struggle

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
going on inside of
him, where part of him

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:90%
really wanted to shoot me.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And another part, just because,
I think just because of the way

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at him--

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
You looked at his
eyes, his face.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and just-- and
his arm begin to shake.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- then suddenly he
dropped the arm with the gun

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And he just dropped and turned
around, and he drove away.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And I was lucky.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.911 align:middle line:84%
Because evidently there
were a number of other women

00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:90%
that he had killed.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only-- I was
the only woman who--

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:90%
who survived his attack.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You were able to
identify him, and find out

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:90%
that he was a serial killer?

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I was, yeah.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And how-- how do you tell
this story without going

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
into-- I mean the first time
you told the story to me,

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:90%
I was sobbing.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't understand
how you endured so much.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have such a
loving heart today.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, this,
as bad as this was,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
there were things in my
childhood that were much worse.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
They weren't as
dramatic, but much worse.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I don't
know how I made it.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody
can make-- make it

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
through a really
challenging childhood,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and dramatic events in life.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:90%
But I'm so grateful that I did.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to that moment.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And you were laying there
on the side of the road.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Who found you?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Um, I was found by a stranger,
someone just passing by.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken to--
and I was conscious.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken to
the emergency ward.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
the drive there.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I can remember how beautiful
the trees were and the sky.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And you think, this guy has
just hit you, he shot you.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
thinking about how

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:90%
beautiful everything was?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:90%
You weren't in trauma, shock?

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I must have been.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Because why was I thinking,
isn't this beautiful?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But I could just
remember looking

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
at the sky and the clouds,
and being deeply appreciative

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:90%
of the beauty of our world.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Again, I can't understand that.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I experienced.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
hospital people were shouting.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, nobody get
shot in that part of the world.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tiny
little country hospital.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was in so much pain, and
the-- the noises were so loud.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the lights
were so bright.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it all got really
quiet and dark and soft,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and the pain subsided.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was inside of
this black sphere or bubble.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
People say you were
in-- you were, you know,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:90%
you were in the tunnel.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.981 align:middle line:84%
In the void.
Yeah.

00:09:17.981 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
That's what it seemed.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Were you indeed dying?

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't
have a sense of dying.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I was just noticing
what I was experiencing.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said
I'd actually died.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.525 align:middle line:84%
So my physical body at
that point um-- was you

00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:35.351 align:middle line:84%
know, they actually told
someone that I died.

00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, but it sounds
like that experience--

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but was that experience of that
darkness that you explained,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.411 align:middle line:84%
and the quietness,
was there pain there?

00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
No.
It was just.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just very serene.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like this dark
soft black bubble I was in.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It was like it
burst, and everywhere

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
was this beautiful,
beautiful golden light.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:90%
And I was so happy.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of near-death
experiences before.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And all I knew was
that I was home.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I knew I'd been there before.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It was familiar.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was so real, and
so familiar and beautiful

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that my life up to that
point, seemed like a dream.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that moment,
vividly, like it was yesterday?

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:90%
I remember it so vividly.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was years
before I could talk about it

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
without bursting into tears.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Because I was homesick.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.515 align:middle line:90%
Because it was so beautiful.

00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you came back,
and-- and at that point did

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
you wake back up at any moment?

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember waking back up?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was there for a while.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- there
were some things

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that were-- they didn't
seem strange at all to me

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Looking back and from
this perspective,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:90%
they seem really strange.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
But there was no time.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I could not conceive
of the past.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I could not conceive
of the future.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
In that place they
did not exist.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Everything was now.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was so, well of course.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's the way it is.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:10%
And there was
something else that

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:10%
was-- it didn't seem strange.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:10%
But it seems strange now, is
everybody who's ever lived,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:10%
everybody who's ever
going to live was there.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I say those
words it sounds

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
like there's all
like a really crowded

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
stadium with all these people.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't like that.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It was like we were one.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So their consciousness
was there.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
But we were separate.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can't-- I cannot conceive
of this in this reality.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But there, there was no
separation between anyone.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:90%
But somehow we were individual.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
I know it's weird.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But-- and there was this
music, beautiful music,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and light and music
were the same thing.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
They weren't separate.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Where in this reality
they're separate.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The most overwhelming experience
of that place was love.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
It was different than the
kind of love we have here.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Here, you know, I love you.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.101 align:middle line:84%
And you love me, and--
but we're separate.

00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes, I understand.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.444 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- it's hard
to put words to it.

00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
nothing that we can

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
compare it to in this world,
in our current reality.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
There's always this sense,
even when the love is

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
so deep and so
profound, there's always

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:90%
a sense of being separate.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
In that place there
was no separation

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:84%
between you and love,
between love and another.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It was instant and always.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And even those people that
maybe we've had challenges with,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's not even forgiveness.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because forgiveness is kind
of like, well you did wrong,

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and I'm forgiving you.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not even like that.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like I am.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.102 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.267 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to me.

00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
It does make sense to me.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.235 align:middle line:84%
Because I have had that state of
consciousness in an experience

00:13:27.235 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that I had where I
almost died, as well.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I do understand what
you're talking about.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you came
back to consciousness,

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
did you take that feeling
back into the emergency room,

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:84%
in dealing with
the physical issues

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and talking to police about this
person, and identifying him?

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
How did you translate that on?

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.185 align:middle line:84%
Well just quickly, I didn't
want to leave that place.

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:53.385 align:middle line:84%
And when I've talked
to people who'd

00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
had near-death experiences,
that don't want to leave.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
There was this river,
beautiful river.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.021 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was
a river of light.

00:13:59.021 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:90%
It was golden.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I could get
across that river I would

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:90%
never come back to my body.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:90%
And I got about halfway through.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like I got roped.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- I'm Cherokee
on my mother's side,

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and my family was
involved in the rodeo.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So as a kid my cousins
would practice roping on me.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, I'm getting roped.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
People say it was--
my astral cord.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting-- getting
yanked back into my body,

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:90%
as I hear a voice.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep and booming voice,
saying, it's not your time.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.965 align:middle line:90%
You have to go back.

00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There's some things
you need to do.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And at that point I got
yanked back into my body.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.461 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors couldn't
believe that I came back.

00:14:40.461 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-They were astonished.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some--
one of the doctors

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
said I was written up in a
medical journal somewhere.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:90%
How long will you dead for?

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever say?

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.259 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter, does it?
-They probably did.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I imagine it wasn't long.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%
But it was long enough.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like when I
was on the other side,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
it seemed like a long time.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.771 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it probably
was just a very short time.

00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of damage
that you endured with all

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of the physicality that
you were talking about,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:84%
the organs, and the spleen,
and the adrenal gland

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:90%
that were all literally shot.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
How did you experience
that when you came

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
from this place of
bliss, and you were

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:90%
pulled back in, so to speak?

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Until that point, I as
a young teenage girl,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:90%
identified with my body.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I was my body.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, and teen-aged
girls, you know, if the body

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:90%
gets big they have traumas.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they think
they are big, or-- it

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:90%
was all those kind of thoughts.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I think I was 115, and
thought I should lose weight.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But until that point, I
thought I was my body.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back,
I realized that was

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:90%
so little of who I was.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.155 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I and
all of us are infinite

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and forever, and universal.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that happened was I

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
began to see things
other people didn't see.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw a lights around
plants and people.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:90%
And I heard sounds.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Like every blade of
grass has a song.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And every blade of
grass has light.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And-- and when I tried to tell
people about this they thought,

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, it's
the drugs you're on.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But after I wasn't on the
pain medication anymore,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I still heard things
and saw things,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and-- and began to
perceive a world

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
so different than the
world I perceived before.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And you still do now, right?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And my body healed
really quickly.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean within-- I still don't
have those glands and organs,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
but it hasn't seemed
to make a difference.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
because of the state of mind

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that you're in, or
did you do training

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
around your body healing or
did it just heal that fast?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:90%
My body healed that fast.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Eventually I did want to
learn more about healing.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I trained in native
cultures around the world,

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and entered into the
realm, and became a healer,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:90%
of the realm of healing.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:90%
But it just healed.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a reason why.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
the things I really

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
love working with people is I
believe inside of every person

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:90%
is a-- it's like an ember.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
An ember, and maybe
it's covered with ash.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
But-- but if that ember
bursts into flame,

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't even
have to be a big flame,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
a flame of remembering
who you are, just like I

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
came back knowing I
was more than my body.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.775 align:middle line:84%
I think that ember
ignites a healing force.

00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's such a huge lesson for
us to understand and to learn

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
from, what you went through.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to ask you again,
when you were identifying

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
this man, did you ever go back
to that feeling of compassion

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
when you were identifying him to
police, and when he was caught,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and all that you've learned
about him since then?

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I saw him,
I was actually scared,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:90%
when I saw him in person.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:90%
In through the photos or you?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.111 align:middle line:84%
No they took me into
the police station.

00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Well the first time
was they actually took

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
me at night to a gas station.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They said, we think
he works here.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.071 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted me
to stand outside the car

00:18:16.071 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to identify him.
But they said, wear sunglasses.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody will notice.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, OK.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like nighttime.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wear sunglasses in this
part-- it's not California.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
No one wears
sunglasses at night.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:90%
So that was a little scary.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.046 align:middle line:84%
They said, don't worry.
We're here.

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:90%
We've got our guns out.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.625 align:middle line:90%
I'm like oh my god.

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly traumatized
teenager with missing organs,

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.731 align:middle line:84%
and they bring you to a
parking lot at a gas station.

00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-But he-- he wasn't there then.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But then they took me
to a police station.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- had
him sitting in a room

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
facing towards an open door.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And they had me walk by.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was-- that was scary.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It was very scary.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I was not in that same
place, had that compassion.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I did
enter into a place

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:90%
of deep compassion for him.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It came out of actually the
past-life work that I did.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back into
a past life and saw, OK.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:90%
This didn't start in this life.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:90%
This started in another time.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And doing that was powerful.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
lessons that I think is

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:90%
so, so powerful from all this.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to teach us on
how to do a little of that.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But, so you identified him.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:90%
He was arrested.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And he wound up in jail.
-Right.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And he was caught?

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:90%
He was caught.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a really big
case, a guy named J Edgar

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Hoover got involved did it.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:90%
And the FBI got involved in it.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the people
that this man had killed

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:90%
was a senator's niece.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So it-- and it had
got a lot of publicity

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
across the United States.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And a-- a big law
firm in New York

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:90%
came pro bono to defend him.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a tiny little town
with a tiny little prosecutor.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean he wasn't tiny.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But I mean without all the
resources of a big law firm.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And there was no way
he could be innocent.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
The-- the bullet-- the evidence.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The bullet from his gun
matched the bullet in my body.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The paint from his car matched
the paint on my motorbike.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I identified him.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone who actually knew
him, even though he didn't

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
live in the area, had
noticed him, and noticed him

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:90%
following me.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't you think
that would do it?

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But in those days,
and it's-- thank

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
goodness it's different now.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
There was kind of the thought
if it's in the newspaper,

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the idea
was that if you

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
can prove that the person
deserved to be shot,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:90%
they could get off.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is they
made up stuff in the newspaper.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.360 align:middle line:84%
They said that I
was a drug addict.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't even
smoke cigarettes.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean--
-Wow.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I was an A student.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I was a cheerleader.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
I was a class officer.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you know,
a good-- good girl.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they said that
I was going to orgies

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:90%
with people of other races.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And it listed the races.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Which I mean now no one
could get away with that.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I was a virgin.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
I was a virgin.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I kissed a boy once.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh my god.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they said
I was a communist.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Now that probably, at that
time was the worst thing.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I can
barely spell communism.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know what that is.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.971 align:middle line:84%
So they spun your story
for you to be the bad guy.

00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Don't tell me this guy got off.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.466 align:middle line:90%
He got off.

00:21:37.466 --> 00:21:38.732 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were
going to say that.

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:90%
He got off.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the stories
in the newspaper

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.514 align:middle line:84%
were so horrific that I had-- in
high school I got voted nicest,

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
you know how they do that.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.864 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of silly,
in high school.

00:21:48.864 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
In the yearbook, yeah.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Yearbook.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the
stories were so horrific

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
in the newspaper, none-- I had--
I used to have so many friends.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I had no friends.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
My best friend wasn't
allowed to talk to me.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
When I would walk
down the street,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84%
this little tiny
farming community,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
people would walk
to the other side.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who had been in
and out of mental hospitals,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
was-- she ran away for a while.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:90%
My father left.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was-- I had nothing.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I moved to
another little town.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And I got a--

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was
pushing 18, I think.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else was--

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
You're still a teenage.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else went
off to college.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't afford
to go to college.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So I got a job at a truck stop,
washing dishes, and trying

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to earn money to go to college.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was eating cat food, and--
-Oh my god.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah it
didn't last very long.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It tasted really-- you'd think.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
ingredients, tuna and vitamins.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You'd think, what
could be wrong?

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.672 align:middle line:90%
It's tuna and vitamins.

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:90%
It tastes terrible.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.274 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- to
die-- I tried to-- I

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
was going to kill myself.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Because I had nothing.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.130 align:middle line:90%
I had no family support.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.565 align:middle line:90%
I had no friends.

00:23:06.565 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
You were ostracized
by your community.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You had this horrific
trauma in your life.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:84%
You know though, something
kind of wonderful happened.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I had decided I was
going to kill myself.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- this was a
town that was in Ohio.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:84%
There's this river
called the Maumee River.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like mommy, but
it's spelled differently.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I was going
to-- and it was very cold,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:90%
it was late November.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I was
going to one night,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I was going to jump off a
bridge into the Maumee River,

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and I was going to kill myself.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I don't
know what it was.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It must by been about 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had to walk through
a park at nighttime,

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to get to the bridge
so I could jump off.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And as was walking
through the park,

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
there was-- I saw a young
man sitting on a bench.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Now normally you
would never go up

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to a man sitting on a bench
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, what
can he do to me

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to do
it myself in a few minutes.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:90%
So I just walked up to him.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you OK?

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And so I sat down.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.411 align:middle line:84%
He went on to explain that he
was on his way to kill himself.

00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
But, see I'd never heard
of anyone else killing

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:90%
themselves on that bridge.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Because, I don't know,
farming community.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't too-- I don't know.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't a common thing.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of it.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't occur to me how
unusual that was at the time.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he explained--
he was about my age.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was explaining
about all these things

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that were happening
in his life, and how

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:90%
just life wasn't worth living.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So I said, you know what.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It seems really bad now.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:90%
But you're young.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:90%
You're going to make it.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
You just have to just, you
know, just give it a shot.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:10%
Just keep going, and
don't let it stop you.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:10%
And so I gave him a pep talk.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:10%
And as I did, I felt
better and better.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And finally he said,
oh thank you so much.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that point the sun
was just starting to rise.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I could remember
the snow that

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
had looked so dirty
at, you know, 2:30

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in the morning; looked
so glowing and pink.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so good.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around
and walked back.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Now I know that was an angel.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I believe in angels.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I had angelic experiences
when I was in the hospital.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I have had angelic
experiences since then.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:90%
But I know that was an angel.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And angels sometimes
they come with the wings.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, but most
often they come

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:90%
in a form you can relate to.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And you never saw him again?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So you were basically
counseling yourself?

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:90%
He saved me.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And he came in a form
that I could relate to.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And you give him
all the advice that

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:90%
should have given yourself.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.791 align:middle line:84%
And you essentially
gave to yourself.

00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And so after that you stayed
and did your life turn around?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually it wasn't--
it wasn't easy.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually I made
it into college.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Eventually I began-- I wanted
to find out more about healing.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because of my own
journey with my own body.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out more about
the lights that I was seeing,

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and the music I was hearing.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not music like a symphony.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's more like tones.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I trained
with the Hawaiian Kahuna,

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:32.155 align:middle line:84%
and eventually with shamans
in different traditions.

00:26:32.155 --> 00:26:34.811 align:middle line:84%
In different healers you
were able to find your way.

00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Which is, as I say, your
story is so incredible.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many details.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:84%
That if anybody has ever been in
the position of wanting to end

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
it all, and coming to you
now and saying my life

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is not worth living, you
have such an enormous story

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to tell people.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So how do you-- you
mentioned that you had

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:90%
a past life with this person.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Or that you look back now,
at all that you've learned.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see that it
happened before this moment.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I
talked about when you're

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in those traumatic
situations, how it all

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:90%
can seem like it's going slow.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like time slows down.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember when he was
holding the gun, the thought.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the thought
that went through my head.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And the thought was,
if you want to kill me

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:90%
you're aiming too low.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to aim
higher to kill me.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a very
strange thought to have.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking, why
did I have that thought?

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in a
past-life regression,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and a past-life regression is
something I'm passionate about.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I've written about.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I've done it in I think 25
countries around the world,

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is regressing people
back into past lives.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's something I
really believe in.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.211 align:middle line:84%
And- and I want you to tell
what that is, a little bit.

00:27:56.211 --> 00:27:58.271 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
What is past-life regression?

00:27:58.271 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Past-life regression
is literally

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
going on an inner journey,
past your conscious mind

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
into your subconscious,
to remember who you were.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And going through
a visualization.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:90%
A visualization, yeah.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like a visualization.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I call it inner journey.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's like a visualization.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You could even say it's
like your imagination.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And you are now since then a
past-life regression therapist.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:90%
There are many--

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I train
people to do that.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But the past life with him
that I went back, so I needed

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to preface that with how.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So I regressed myself
back to find out

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:90%
why did I have this thought.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, if you're
going to shoot me,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:10%
you need to aim a little higher.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:10%
And I saw a past life that
for him was really difficult,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:10%
where it was a life in China.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And in this village
we all lived on houses

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.770 align:middle line:90%
that were up on stilts.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was a man in town
who was the untouchable.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And that was him.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were holes
in the floor where

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
we would put our waste
products, human waste

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:90%
products and things.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And he would come every morning
and crawl underneath the stilts

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:90%
to collect the waste products.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And for him, for us-- at that
point there wasn't even--

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like we
didn't even relate to him.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Because he was an untouchable.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
For us it wasn't
that big of a deal.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But for him it was
a huge, big deal.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Because in that life
he was rejected.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And after the trial, I
was rejected by a town.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So-- so-- and for
him shooting me,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
it probably wasn't
that big of a deal.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was a huge
big deal for me.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But in that life,
does that make sense?

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, in a way.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And it makes more sense as you
explain past-life regression.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And the memory that you're
talking about was so clear.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
it as if it was real.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I don't look at
past lives as punishment.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:90%
We were bad in the past life.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
punished in this life.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't look at it like that.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I look at it as
almost like a choice.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like we choose experiences
that will allow us to deepen

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:84%
our compassion, to
deepen our understanding,

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.100 align:middle line:90%
to deepen our love.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's ever
a correcting of karma,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
or if it's a
completing a circle.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I-- I would probably
look at it more

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.321 align:middle line:84%
like a completing of a circle.
-Than anything?

00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Rather than, even
correcting a cycle

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
sounds a little bit
like punishment.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:90%
It isn't punishment.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I almost think, I can
almost imagine us,

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
we're up in the spirit world,
and there's some little clouds.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And we look at all of our
incarnations and say, you know,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I just need a little
bit of humility.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:84%
How about you incarnate with
me, and teach me humility?

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And the guy says, no way.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I'm not going
to incarnate with you.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, oh.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
another guy, hey, hey.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you incarnate with me?

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Teach me humility.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to mess
up my incarnation

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:90%
teaching you humility.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And finally you find
someone that you're deeply

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:90%
connected to on a soul level.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Will you incarnate with me?

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I really would like
to learn humility.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Only because I love you.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you run, jump
into baby bodies.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.784 align:middle line:90%
And he into baby bodies.

00:31:11.784 --> 00:31:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And you get bigger,
bigger, bigger.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And eventually he's your boss.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And he teaches you humility.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And you hate him.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And you forget how it got
set up in the first place.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.570 align:middle line:84%
That is a wonderful story of
what it means to reincarnate.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible story.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of telling it that's
a teaching story, the way

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:90%
that you just explained that.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we could look
at people in our lives,

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.240 align:middle line:84%
whomever seemingly done
something wrong that we felt

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
wronged by, to look at
it from that perspective,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:84%
causes the healing that you
sit here and embody right now.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormous example
in healing of who you are.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So teaching us a little bit
about getting into that place

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of finding out who
those people are,

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:90%
and going into a past life.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I just
wanted to ask really quickly,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever happened to the guy?

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Eventually he-- eventually
he did go to prison.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he got out, and
then went back to prison.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And-- and now he's
in the spirit world.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.020 align:middle line:84%
-So he was killed in prison?
-No.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.820 align:middle line:84%
He I think just got out of
prison and died of old age.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So to complete that
story, I wanted to know,

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.230 align:middle line:84%
because it creates a
closure on that end.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:90%
So you teach now about dreams.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:84%
You teach about
past-life regression.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.770 align:middle line:90%
You teach about clearing space.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And the sentence that I said
at the beginning of the show

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you teach really
how to become more conscious

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in your life, and
ultimately to become

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.210 align:middle line:84%
more loving by
connecting yourself

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:90%
in various ways in your life.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So how does past-life
regression, or even listening

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to your dreams, help us become
more conscious and more loving?

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you know in-- I don't
have a private practice now.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I just do group regressions.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But when I had a private
practice and people would come

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and they would
talk about somebody

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:90%
who had really victimized them.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we would regress back
to that event in a past life,

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
always this was what-- this
was what was astonishing to me.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Always I found that there
was this depth of love

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
when they went back far enough.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I though, isn't
that interesting?

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The people that we feel
victimized the most by often

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
there is a soul contract, a
soul agreement if you will.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Often those are the people
that on a soul level

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:90%
we have the deepest love.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And someone might be
listening, and saying no way.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:84%
My ex-husband,
we're like-- no way.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:90%
But it always amazed me.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it would even amaze
the people who would go

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.674 align:middle line:90%
on these past-life regressions.

00:33:46.674 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I wouldn't
have any agenda.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Just let's see
where it takes us.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
But over and over again, they
would experience that love,

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:90%
and in doing so it healed them.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You know that old
expression, feeling

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
resentment is like
swallowing poison,

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.020 align:middle line:90%
hoping the other person dies?

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.650 align:middle line:90%
So I've not heard that, yeah.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like that.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like we don't forgive
for the other person.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:90%
We forgive for ourselves.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:90%
For ourselves.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
And so that ultimately leads you
to a place of self-acceptance?

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It-- you know, I said I've had
angelic experiences since then?

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
an angel with wings.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And I've always wanted to.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I've met people, who say, oh
I saw an angel with wings.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh I've never
seen an angel with wings.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was taking
a walk in Seattle.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.657 align:middle line:84%
There's a lake
called Green Lake.

00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking
around the lake.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
I really want

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:90%
to see an angel with wings.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I really want to see
an angel with wings.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like a mantra
as I'm walking.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful,
older black man,

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.420 align:middle line:84%
wearing colorful clothes
on roller skates,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
he started roller
skating around me.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:84%
And then he was roller skating
in front of me backwards.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And he was laughing.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had these
beautiful, clear eyes.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
to tell you something.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
important is love of self,

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:90%
love of others, and love of god.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else is important.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost as if
well-- then he skated off.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh
my god, oh my god.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.629 align:middle line:90%
It was an angel.

00:35:17.629 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, but I still want
to see an angel with wings.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:90%
But he was just saying--

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.120 align:middle line:90%
What a message.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not important whether you
see an angel with wings or not.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:90%
That's not what this is about.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:90%
What it's about is love.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds so cheesy.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But really that's
what it's about.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And love to me is acceptance.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance is love.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Love of self, accepting
yourself unconditionally.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, you drank too much.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
You're on the floor on the
throw-up up and go, oh god.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:90%
There I go again.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean it doesn't mean
you don't take action.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But it means to have
not to rack yourself,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:84%
if you eat that piece
of chocolate cake,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:84%
not to rack yourself
with guilt and shame.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.486 align:middle line:90%
It's just like it was good.

00:36:04.486 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's total
self-acceptance.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just accepting yourself,
and knowing that you're

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
doing the best you can.
-Yes.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing story, where
he said these things toy you.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:84%
You remember exactly
what he said.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And then he skated away.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You have had some
extraordinary stories.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you teach people
how to-- to basically get

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to that place of self-acceptance
through past-life regression,

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.890 align:middle line:84%
through listening
to your dreams.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
video of you on Oprah.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is Denise Linn
talking about her dreams.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.000 align:middle line:90%
My bedroom is my sanctuary.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the place that I
can go, shut the door,

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:90%
and really shut out the world.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.136 align:middle line:84%
And it's the place where I
can connect with my spirit.

00:36:48.136 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I have a really busy life.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I find that sometimes
I just get drained.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And it means so much
to me to have one place

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.715 align:middle line:84%
where I can refuel, where
I can gain my energy back.

00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I like flowers.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I like wonderful smells.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I like the textures of the
bedding and the curtains.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I love the candlelight
at night, and the warmth

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
that it brings into the bedroom.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The scenes of nature
that I have in my bedroom

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
were painted by my husband,
and that really feeds my soul.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:90%
My bed was made by my husband.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm in it,
not only does it

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
carry the love of my husband.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But it also carries a sense of
strength and stability for me.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So many people get into bed
and they turn the TV on.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And it really-- it takes
them out of their life.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a TV in my bedroom.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a phone,
the reason being it

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
was so easy to pick that phone
up and start doing business.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And that place that was a
sanctuary all of a sudden

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a sanctuary.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Even an alarm clock can
pull you away from yourself.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up first
thing in the morning

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to that jangling sound, it
sets an energy for the day.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
How much better it is
to awake to soft music,

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, or to awake to
the sun coming in your window.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
As much as possible, it's
important to have space

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.680 align:middle line:84%
underneath the bed to
have a sense of clarity,

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:90%
even if it can't be seen.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious mind is aware
that directly beneath our body

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.670 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of disorganization.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing
in your bedroom

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:84%
should be something
you love, or you use.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It should have meaning to you.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
If you focus on things
that are beautiful,

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.760 align:middle line:84%
you will see beauty around you,
and the space that you live in

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
can be a template for
what you desire in life.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
If you desire to have
more peace in your life,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.916 align:middle line:84%
create an environment
that feels peaceful.

00:38:36.916 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:84%
If you want more
adventure in your life,

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.790 align:middle line:84%
create an environment
that feels adventuresome.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I think of my bedroom
as a sacred space.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a place for rejuvenation,
a place for healing,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.518 align:middle line:84%
a place where I refuel, where
I can go and feed my soul,

00:38:53.518 --> 00:38:56.326 align:middle line:90%
where I can go and do nothing.

00:38:56.326 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then that nothing
is everything.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:10%
So you just shared with
me that when you were asked

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.330 align:middle line:10%
on the Oprah Show that was the
first time that you had taught

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:10%
in the United
States, or that you

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:10%
presented in the United States.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's what was amazing.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:10%
I like I said, I've taught in
25 countries around the world.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.940 align:middle line:10%
And I would always go
where people asked me.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.967 align:middle line:10%
And I would only get asked
to little tiny countries

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.800 align:middle line:10%
But I never got asked to
teach in the United States.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it's
just so strange

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.310 align:middle line:90%
that it's my own country.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not been asked here.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So I did a very deep
meditation to look

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:90%
and see what's that all about.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that I was
afraid that the man who

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
shot me, because at
that point he was-- I

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:90%
mean he wasn't in jail.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.605 align:middle line:84%
That he would find me,
and that he would--

00:39:43.605 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:84%
he would-- because he
had said, I'll get you.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:90%
He said that to you--

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone told me he
had-- the policeman

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:84%
told me had said that.
So--

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:90%
When he was arrested?

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And as he was going off to jail.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And then he got out.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:90%
But so I was afraid.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that I was afraid.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I do not want
to live my life in fear.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I made a stand.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I could
remember so clearly.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I stood up at my
home office, my desk.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I face this.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And probably within an hour,
I got a telephone call from

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:90%
the producer of the Oprah Show.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my gosh.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:90%
I declared.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to face my fear.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking, couldn't be
like a little local TV show?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Why does it have
to be like Oprah?

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm back-pedalling.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.709 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK.
I'll come on.

00:40:33.709 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But I will not talk
about getting shot.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Because my name's different now.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.695 align:middle line:84%
And people said, friends said,
no mass murderer is going

00:40:40.695 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to be watching Oprah anyway.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, you couldn't be so
sure, because you had a child.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.230 align:middle line:90%
I did have a child.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- and I think when I
was facing my fear and looking,

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
my fear was as
much for her as it

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:90%
was for me, probably more so.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Because at the point was
very protective of her.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:90%
But I went.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And-- and it was scary.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:90%
But I'm so glad that I did it.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So you were teaching then
about-- about space clearing.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:84%
You were teaching about how
to set up your environment.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.557 align:middle line:84%
And you were using your
dream work at that time.

00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was what you were
brought on the Oprah Show

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.950 align:middle line:90%
for, right?

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That-- I've been on the
Oprah show several times.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.240 align:middle line:84%
That particular show was about
living life with passion.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- and I
can admit this now.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Because it was a long time ago.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually-- there was
like the five-point passion.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
who was a journalist

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.210 align:middle line:84%
had written up this, Denise
Linn's five points for passion.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But she was a friend, and
she made up the five points.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't ask me.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, Oh I knew it
would be OK with you.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:90%
So they found this article.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And they liked it so much.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well
you know, come and talk

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:90%
about your five points.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well
what five points?

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.874 align:middle line:84%
And they said it
was in this article.

00:41:56.874 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm like OK.
I'll talk about--

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.704 align:middle line:84%
You've had such
a miraculous life.

00:42:00.704 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's people
who have written

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:84%
volumes and wanted to be
on Oprah all of their life,

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and you're--

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was
the universe saying,

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.580 align:middle line:84%
you have declared to
the creator that you

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:90%
are ready to face this fear.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:90%
So step up.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean to me, I think,
because it wasn't my plan.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even-- I mean, I
was surprised about this.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about the
article until that point.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:26.701 align:middle line:84%
Well, that just shows that you
were in such a miraculous place

00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're teaching through
all of your stories,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:90%
which I absolutely love.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's another incredible
example of how you ultimately

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
have used forgiveness so many
different times in your life,

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.340 align:middle line:90%
with your father.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now your parents, you said,
you didn't communicate that

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
much with them after college?
-No.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.240 align:middle line:84%
It was-- just to
take a step back.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.330 align:middle line:90%
My mother was very violent.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.180 align:middle line:90%
She was paranoid schizophrenic.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.937 align:middle line:84%
She-- they put her-- the
first time they put her

00:42:56.937 --> 00:42:58.570 align:middle line:84%
in a mental hospital, it
was because they thought

00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.403 align:middle line:90%
she was going to kill me.

00:42:59.403 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:90%
She was very violent.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was scary.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, often I'd sleep
in the bathtub at night,

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and lock the door.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was really scary.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes she would
come in the middle the night,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and start hitting
us, and mostly me.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I was the oldest.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when she was
in the mental hospital

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:84%
my father was
sexually abusing me.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
He'd take me and
put me in this bed.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.735 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:43:20.735 --> 00:43:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And in those days
you could not tell.

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You just-- and especially
when you're threatened.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:90%
You just can't tell.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was horrific.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And those scars,
especially from my father,

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:84%
you would think the worst
would be the physical violence.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But especially from my father,
those scars went so deep.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And he-- he had cancer.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I got a phone
call that he was dying.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I kept wanting
him to apologize.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew how deep those
wounds in me were.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if he
apologizes then I can heal.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.694 align:middle line:90%
And I was so excited.

00:44:00.694 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean,
this sounds terrible.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.659 align:middle line:90%
He's dying.

00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, oh
I can finally heal.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:90%
But that was what was true.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Of course, yes.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm on the
plane, and thinking I

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.190 align:middle line:84%
can finally heal those wounds
from that childhood abuse.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And I got off the plane.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And someone came up to me
at the airport and said,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.522 align:middle line:90%
well he's dead.

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well he can't die.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.274 align:middle line:90%
I have to heal.

00:44:22.274 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I need to finish this.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I have to finish this.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:25.851 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well,
I want to see him.

00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:26.616 align:middle line:90%
And they said, well no.

00:44:26.616 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:90%
He's going to be cremated.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't see him.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
going to see him.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And he was in a warehouse.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived at the warehouse,
they didn't want me in.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.700 align:middle line:84%
They said, well
you can't see him.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
going to see him.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I was
pretty insistent,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I went back to this little
room that was fluorescent lit.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.890 align:middle line:84%
There was an old
wooden crate to sit on.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And there was my dead father.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Now when he was alive, I
never liked him to touch me.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:90%
It really-- it made me nauseous.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It activated all those
childhood memories.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But for the first time
ever, I touched him.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And I touched his cold hands,
and his toes and his forehead.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
I started screaming.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can imagine the people in
the warehouse like, oh my gosh!

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:15.649 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:45:15.649 --> 00:45:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And I screamed like, how could
you do that to a little girl?

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:90%
How could you?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm screaming.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And at one point I had to
get a subsequent surgery

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.900 align:middle line:90%
after the original surgery.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have any money.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, if
you don't get this surgery,

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.680 align:middle line:90%
you'll die.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he could
help me with the surgery.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well I hope
you can find some money.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, how can you
say that to your daughter?

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.060 align:middle line:90%
She's going to die without this.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm screaming and screaming.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
just felt like a balloon

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:43.450 align:middle line:90%
that had deflated.

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:48.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- and the whole
room seemed to glow golden.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said out loud, I don't
even know if I believe this.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
say these words.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.870 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, I heard his voice.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said all of those years
when you were waiting for me

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to ask for your
forgiveness, I was

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.710 align:middle line:90%
waiting for you to forgive me.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment it dissolved.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I forgave him.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think--
I think forgiveness

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.290 align:middle line:90%
comes when it comes.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:90%
It can't be forced.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:33.410 align:middle line:90%
But in that moment it was done.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.890 align:middle line:84%
That is even hard to
conceptualize that he would

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.670 align:middle line:84%
have been asking or waiting
for you to forgive him

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:middle line:90%
in order to ask for forgiveness.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a
thought that you would

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:84%
have even attempted to think.
-No.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And I left feeling
such a depth of peace.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Your stories of
forgiveness are so powerful.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And that you are
even here to tell

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.900 align:middle line:84%
these stories without bursting
into tears is amazing.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:84%
You truly have healed from
your experiences, haven't you?

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.330 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.400 align:middle line:90%
I am so blessed.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And you when you
tell the stories,

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised that
you're not crying.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that you've
completed so much?

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You've completed the
cellular memory, everything?

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.340 align:middle line:84%
There are places in my
body that still react.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That would make sense.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Because of the trauma.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Especially from my father.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of my
mind and my emotions,

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.400 align:middle line:90%
it's-- I'm pretty clear.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.020 align:middle line:84%
You have done an
enormous amount of work.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean there's always layers.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But I've taken care of a lot
of the big layers, anyway.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.250 align:middle line:90%
You have.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
teach these days,

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.960 align:middle line:84%
is to teach getting
through the layers.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And through this,
you have infused

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.640 align:middle line:84%
spirituality into almost
everything that you do.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.540 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach to infuse
spirituality into life?

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.360 align:middle line:90%
How you do that?

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean at what point do you
bring in spirit to help you?

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it always there for you?

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something you
consciously have to go to?

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
power of gratitude.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I've looked at my life,
and I've really taken the time

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to discern how did I make it
when so many other people with

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:90%
similar circumstances didn't?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What strategy did I use?

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.070 align:middle line:84%
What method was valuable, so I
could share that with others?

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was
I have a gratitude cell.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness, you must.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Right next to the
forgiveness cell.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And simply, simply
being grateful.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is
what has healed me.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's always--
there is always

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:90%
something to be grateful for.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:84%
There is always something
to be grateful for.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you can focus
on that, that is

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.120 align:middle line:84%
what will expand in your life.
-Wow.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Well you have an incredible
connection with the divine.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a video here
of you in action.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.050 align:middle line:84%
This is Denise Linn
in a beautiful state

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.170 align:middle line:84%
of practicing infusing
spirituality into your life.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:26.495 align:middle line:90%


00:49:26.495 --> 00:49:27.194 align:middle line:90%
Hay-ay-ay-ya.

00:49:27.194 --> 00:49:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.599 align:middle line:90%
Hay-ay-ya.

00:49:34.599 --> 00:49:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Hay-ya-hay-ya-hay-ya
Hay-ya-hay-ya-hay-ya.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Hay-ya.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Hay-ya means come spirit.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.110 align:middle line:90%
We invite you to this place.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:90%
We invite you into our hearts.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.100 align:middle line:84%
We invite you into our lives.
Hay-ya.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:10%
So in that video
you were chanting

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:10%
a Native American chant.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.190 align:middle line:10%
And you mentioned earlier,
you are half Cherokee, right?

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm Cherokee on
my mother's side.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:10%
And she was passionately about
gaining rights for her people.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.370 align:middle line:10%
She wasn't so passionate
about the spirituality.

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.410 align:middle line:10%
But I tend to think
it's in my blood.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a passion
for understanding more

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.590 align:middle line:84%
about my roots, my
Native American roots.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And have you since
then explored that more?

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And also I've spent time
with the Zulu in Africa.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I was adopted into a Maori
tribe in New Zealand.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I've spent time with the
Aborigines in Australia.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've also explored
my tribal traditions,

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as other Native
American tribal traditions.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So bringing in the
dreams teachings

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that you also bring in, in
the past-life regression.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I-- I just love
everything that you do,

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and how it's all being tied
together to show us how

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.380 align:middle line:90%
to ultimately accept ourselves.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.840 align:middle line:90%
And so you teach about dreams.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You teach about
past-life regression.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of that tied into
a wonderful body of work

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about in terms
of clearing your space.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.390 align:middle line:84%
What got you into that--
that line of talking?

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago I was
teaching in Hong Kong.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I heard about
something called feng shui.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And at the time there
were no books out.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I wrote the
second book ever written

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in English on feng shui.
-Really?

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I coined the
word space clearing.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and now there's lots
of books on space clearing.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the things that
I trained in native cultures

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.790 align:middle line:84%
were space clearing,
but there wasn't

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:01.690 align:middle line:90%
a universal word for that.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So out of that early passion
of meeting people in China,

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and they talked about
the way you organize

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.090 align:middle line:90%
your home can affect your life.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I began to do space clearing.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But also begin to train
people to do space clearing,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and train people in what I call
interior alignment, you know,

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.400 align:middle line:84%
how to align your inner life
with your outer environment.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is truly what
you-- what you've done

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.990 align:middle line:84%
is that through
the space clearing,

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:30.320 align:middle line:84%
you related it back to how
to create different things

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or shift different
things in your life.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.101 align:middle line:84%
I've done that
myself in my life.

00:52:33.101 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:84%
-It works.
-It absolutely works.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Every single culture, native
culture, ancient culture,

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:43.501 align:middle line:10%
employed space clearing, for
the simple reason is it works.

00:52:43.501 --> 00:52:44.200 align:middle line:10%
It does.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.430 align:middle line:10%
The largest Realtor in New York
had some high-end buildings.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.500 align:middle line:10%
They weren't selling.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.610 align:middle line:10%
She hired a space clearer in.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden those
buildings started to sell.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It was reported in
the New York Times.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that space
clearer had been in there.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.890 align:middle line:90%
But it felt different.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:52:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Space clearing works.

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It feels different.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's a quick video that you
could look at on how Denise

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Linn teaches how to
clear your space,

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.881 align:middle line:84%
and how it affects
your relationships.

00:53:06.881 --> 00:53:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we aligning
the outer form, the home,

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:90%
the furnishings, the furniture.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But also we're
aligning ourselves,

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.620 align:middle line:84%
spiritual as well as
physical, and aligning

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.100 align:middle line:90%
that with our environment.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I find that the two
together work very powerfully.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.630 align:middle line:84%
To me, the kitchen represents
nurturing, not just the body,

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:90%
but nurturing the soul.

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times people would
always gather in the kitchen.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the place
where the stories were

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
told around the evening fire.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that creates
a feeling of well-being for me

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen is
we painted it green.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And for me green has to do
with nature, with fresh growth.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:52.280 align:middle line:84%
On the refrigerator I have
pictures of my family,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.587 align:middle line:90%
and of happy times.

00:53:53.587 --> 00:53:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
really important

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that the photographs that
you have in your home

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:58.205 align:middle line:90%
reflect happiness.

00:53:58.205 --> 00:53:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So every time you
look at it, it brings

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.750 align:middle line:90%
back that wonderful memory.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Denise has been married
to David Linn for 26 years.

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Meadow, their
22-year-old daughter,

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is studying French
culture in France.

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.830 align:middle line:84%
David likes to spend
his time either

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:17.490 align:middle line:84%
outdoors or in his basement
studio, painting landscapes.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He's also business manager,
cook and master builder.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And although supportive,
David doesn't always agree

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.070 align:middle line:90%
with his wife's design ideas.

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:30.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
Buddhas, maybe 20 or more,

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Indian Buddhas, Japanese
Buddhas, Chinese Buddhas,

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:90%
a lot of Buddhas.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact
that he supports me.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.300 align:middle line:84%
He thinks we have too
many Buddhas in the house.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.550 align:middle line:84%
He's always looking
for a Buddha-free zone.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I lived two and a half years
in a Zen Buddhist monastery.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So Buddha is a symbol
that means a lot to me.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.970 align:middle line:84%
When we were
designing this house,

00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I wanted one place in the
house that was just for me.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a small house.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So well, we had an extra closet.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So we turned the closet
into a meditation room.

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Even taking just a couple
of minutes in the morning,

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I find has a strong
effect on not just

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.690 align:middle line:90%
my spirit, but also my body.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Research has been
done that has shown

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.210 align:middle line:84%
even just a few
minutes of meditation

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:21.470 align:middle line:90%
stimulates the immune system.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And I feel stronger.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I get less colds.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- my whole body feels
more vibrant and healthy.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Space clearing is
basically using

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:34.210 align:middle line:84%
very specific techniques in
a space to shift the feeling,

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:36.160 align:middle line:90%
shift the energy.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.340 align:middle line:84%
In ancient cultures,
people would

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.400 align:middle line:84%
never consider moving into a
home without clearing it first.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:90%
This was unthinkable.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And using these ancient
techniques in modern times,

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.875 align:middle line:84%
we can make a big difference
in the way our homes feel.

00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.300 align:middle line:84%
For me, the dining
room is a place.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:90%
It's similar to the kitchen.

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it's the place
where we finally sit down

00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and we share about our day.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Not very much,
miniature everything.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I have put a lot of
warmth into my dining room.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
bring that feeling.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of candles.

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.475 align:middle line:84%
And in addition in the dining
room, I placed an alter.

00:56:11.475 --> 00:56:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's an alter that I've
dedicated to inner peace.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Having that particular
alter in the dining room

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.600 align:middle line:84%
brings a sense of
balance and harmony.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is what
health is all about.

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And the food that we
take into our body

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.860 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on the health.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a much
more potent effect

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.900 align:middle line:84%
if we are feeling
relaxed and at peace

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.980 align:middle line:90%
when we're taking that food in.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So having this altar
dedicated to inner peace

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in this very special
place really, I feel,

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:84%
generates a very
healthy and life-giving

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.163 align:middle line:90%
energy into our dining space.

00:56:46.163 --> 00:56:47.720 align:middle line:90%
To Meadow.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.970 align:middle line:84%
When people live in an
environment that is nurturing

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.080 align:middle line:90%
it affects everything.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.310 align:middle line:90%
It affects their prosperity.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.620 align:middle line:90%
It affects their health.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.925 align:middle line:90%
It affects their relationships.

00:56:55.925 --> 00:56:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking you
before, how do you tie

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:90%
all that you teach together?

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of your
incredible enormous story,

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and the journey we've been
on in this short hour,

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:90%
encapsulates your life, lady.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:16.097 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
extraordinary with what

00:57:16.097 --> 00:57:16.830 align:middle line:90%
you have been through.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is such an
example, to me at least,

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that if you can go through
all that you've gone through

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and come out to teach
to a worldwide audience,

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.920 align:middle line:84%
you are one of the most
popular authors at Hay House.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You have lectures all over the
world, an incredibly popular

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.140 align:middle line:90%
radio show on Hay House Radio.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:10%
All that you've done with
your best-selling 17 books

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:10%
that you can come
out on the other end

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:45.360 align:middle line:10%
to teach, and have such
an enormous following.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask you.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that
people are so attracted

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to you and your message?
-You know--

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I told you I wasn't going
to ask you this question,

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.560 align:middle line:90%
but your answer is so beautiful.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.890 align:middle line:84%
From inside myself,
I have no clue.

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But people tend to tell
me over and over again

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:90%
that they like my humility.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And I don't feel very humble.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.230 align:middle line:10%
So I'm always surprised
when people say that.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:16.690 align:middle line:10%
They also say that they
feel a mothering energy.

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have great
associations for mothers.

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.030 align:middle line:84%
My mother was not
a great mother.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.911 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, really?

00:58:22.911 --> 00:58:25.430 align:middle line:84%
But because thousand of
people have told me that.

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:27.330 align:middle line:90%
That that's what they say.

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't experience
either of those things.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean I am a mother
and I love my daughter.

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And you are a mother.

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.751 align:middle line:84%
And that also is
a whole miracle.

00:58:33.751 --> 00:58:34.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a miracle.

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.090 align:middle line:84%
You were not supposed
to have children.

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:36.789 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I was told I would
never have children.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And had damage to your ovaries.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And you had your
beautiful little baby,

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.240 align:middle line:90%
whose now your daughter.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.631 align:middle line:84%
And you created this
incredible cookbook.

00:58:46.631 --> 00:58:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I know.
We co-wrote a cookbook.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.317 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an ordinary
cookbook, either.

00:58:51.317 --> 00:58:52.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the proud
mother speaking.

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:53.211 align:middle line:84%
Like I say.
-See.

00:58:53.211 --> 00:58:55.470 align:middle line:84%
She's a mother.
-No.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a great cookbook.

00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.436 align:middle line:84%
It has kitchen feng
shui and chakra meals.

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a great cookbook.

00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a good book.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good one
to have in your kitchen.

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it teaches about
the alchemy of food.

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.440 align:middle line:90%
So I mean you are an alchemist.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.630 align:middle line:90%
You have changed your life.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You've changed your dramatic
story into one that teaches,

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that inspires, that helps us
understand our past lives,

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and really ultimately you
teach and you live forgiveness.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.570 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you so much.

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:26.950 align:middle line:90%
I love you so much.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Your energy and your
spirit being here

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and your mentorship is
absolutely beautiful.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I have such a special
place in my heart for you.

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.975 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
Thank you.

00:59:35.975 --> 00:59:38.970 align:middle line:84%
-I appreciate it definitely.
-Wow.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
-Yes.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.090 align:middle line:90%
I know that you felt that.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can't get through one
interview without crying.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You have touched
my heart so much.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You have mine as well,
and our listeners as well.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I ask you to inspire other
people with this interview

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.870 align:middle line:90%
