00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.530 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And today, we are going
on a longevity world tour,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
exploring some of the
most exotic health

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
foods of the world through
the eyes of David Wolfe.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
world's top authorities

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
on natural health,
beauty, nutrition,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
herbalism, chocolate,
and organic superfoods.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.057 align:middle line:84%
Welcome.
-How you doing?

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is
going to be so much fun.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to this.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Great to be back.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And great to be
back in this country.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.199 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I had a great trip
around the world.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely magical.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
You're so-- on your
Instagram account,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I see comments that are
saying, I want your job.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, the job that I
actually developed for myself.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, I look at it.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, my god, I
get to travel the world,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.727 align:middle line:84%
do what I want, and have
fun, and get paid to do it.

00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:04.943 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is a job?
-It's amazing.

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of think I
got onto that early.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd better do something
that I really, really love,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:84%
because where your
heart lies, that's where

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.571 align:middle line:90%
your treasures will be found.

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
That's where your passion is.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So why or how did you
get into these world

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
treasures of food and herbalism
and why and how things grow?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:90%
What drew you towards that?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:10%
I think is some
of it is genetic.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Some of it's family trait.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:10%
Some of it is my aunt, who
is really into exotic food

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:10%
and gourmet food.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And my first job was working
in her grocery store as a kid.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was exposed to
these exotic vanillas

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and exotic spices and all
these things that she loved.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I got into doing
raw foods and talks

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
about raw foods, I just
had a natural penchant

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
for exotic fruits.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And then that developed into
exotic herbs and superfoods

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of
the incredible things

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go on a
little bit of a world tour

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:84%
here and look at
some of the slides

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
that David is sharing with us
of some of these exotic fruits--

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
foods and fruits from
around the world.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:90%
So what is this first one?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.223 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: This
is peanut butter

00:02:07.223 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:10%
fruit, or bunchosia argentea.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Doesn't peanut
butter come from peanuts?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: Right.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, it
comes from peanuts.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.394 align:middle line:10%
But this fruit tastes
like peanut butter.

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: You're kidding.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: It's brilliant.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:10%
The flavor is so good.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's perfect,
because most peanut butter

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:10%
is kind of rancid, isn't it?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah
And it's fatty.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
This is more like leukoma.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
It's more like eggfruit.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of a little bit
starchy, a little bit sweet,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:10%
but definitely the peanut
butter notes are there.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:10%
It's originally
from South America.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those fruits
that once you taste it,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.354 align:middle line:84%
it just takes you
there instantly.

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Wow, in South American--
did you go and find this?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
This was actually in Maui.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.346 align:middle line:90%
I was visiting a friend of mine.

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was out visiting
my friend Woody Harrelson.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And his neighbor is a
very old friend of mine.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I used to go to his
farm at the very beginning

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:90%
when he first got that farm.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was feeding us all
of his favorite stuff.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this was in
season at the time.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.121 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Very cool,
so you took a picture.

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
-We took a picture.
-I know, but this is gorgeous.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely beautiful.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: This is the
Egyptian blue lotus--

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:10%
nymphaea caerulea.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's one of the most
treasured flowers in the world.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:90%
It grows in a pond.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a lily
pad type of a thing.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.095 align:middle line:84%
And it's very celebrated
in Greek mythology.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It was mentioned
in "The Odyssey."

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
If you recall, Odysseus,
his men were being

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:90%
captured by the lotus-eaters.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were being drawn
in, like the sirens,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.839 align:middle line:84%
by the lotus-eaters.
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And Lotus Eaters basically
become kind of lazy

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and just want to just
do nothing all day.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Live in that moment, and
it's over-- yes, yes, yes.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it's kind
of a message about life

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in "The Odyssey" about
the lotus-eaters,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
because the lotus petals,
if you eat those petals,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
they are a little
bit psychoactive.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They kind of make you lazy and
you wanna really do anything.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Really?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You just wanna
kind of hang out.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean,
look at the flower.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You could just
gaze at it forever.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%
You just took this picture?

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:90%
This looks like a calendar.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:90%
That's an iPhone picture.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
It really looks like that.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
exquisite variety that

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
was at my friend's place who
had the peanut butter fruit.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And everything he has
is very, very special.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I saw he had
lotuses, I was taking pictures.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Peanut butter fruit--
that still blows my mind.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
All right.
So this is interesting.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Nastus elatus--

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Of course it is.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: The edible bamboo.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is my number
one pick for strong bones

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and teeth for children,
and for adults, as well.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: You can eat that?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:90%
You can actually eat that.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And we will take that
piece right there

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and just dice it up and
throw it into a salad,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite good.
LISA GARR: Really?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that peeled at all,
that what we're looking at?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.949 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've just peeled
off the end there

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
so you can see what the
inner meat looks like,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better term.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
bite into that.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It's soft and chewy.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially similar to
heart of palm, which I also

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
recommend for bones and teeth.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, OK.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:84%
All palm trees are basically
similar to bamboo, which

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:90%
is basically similar to grass.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So the core of palm
trees, the core of bamboo,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and the core of grasses,
if you can get to them,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:90%
are typically edible.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're rich in silica, so
they have incredible ability

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
not only to build
bones and teeth,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
but also nails, hair, skin.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
-So they're beauty foods.
-Ah.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can chew on it, put
it in salads, whatever,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.074 align:middle line:90%
and you get that natural silica.

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: That's right.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a brilliant
salad vegetable.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, oftentimes,
when I'm in Australia,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we'll just make salads
out of nastus elatus,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:90%
the edible bamboo.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the basis.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
How fun.
DAVID WOLFE: It's amazing.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
How fun.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.747 align:middle line:90%
OK, these are beautiful.

00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
What are these we're
looking at here?

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: OK.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:10%
So I love this about
Instagram, being

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:10%
able to share these images.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:10%
These are my cacao trees in
Hawaii, or chocolate trees.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:10%
So chocolate is made out
of a nut called cacao.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:10%
These are nut trees.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:10%
This is the most celebrated
nut in the world,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.821 align:middle line:10%
but nobody knows
it's even a nut.

00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It's chocolate.
It's cacao, or cocoa.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fruit
that it comes from.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's shaped kind
of like Nerf footballs there.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Are they big?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
They will become big.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They'll become the size
of a Nerf football.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
These are smaller.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
They're just growing
into their maturity.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And those trees, actually,
are just coming to that point

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
where we've gone from
producing 10 fruits to 20.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's 100.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.742 align:middle line:90%
In your farm in Kawaii?

00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just on a single tree.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
-Oh my goodness.
-Right.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So that means--
let's say there's

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
30 cacao beans in each one.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.641 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at, suddenly,
3,000 cacao beans on a tree.

00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot.
LISA CARR: Oh my goodness.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And you have hundreds
of these trees?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
We have a couple hundred trees.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you look very closely
at those images there,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there's
this green thing that's kind

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%
of growing around the trunk.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's vanilla.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.977 align:middle line:84%
-You combine them?
-Yeah.

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things we've innovated

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
for permaculture farms
around the world--

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
mixing the cacao
with the vanilla

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:90%
together, growing them together.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of these things--
it was a flash that came

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:90%
on to me about five years ago.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.207 align:middle line:84%
I had a number of great vanilla
vines that were in my nursery,

00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and thought, what am I
going to do with these?

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I've gotta go trellis
them on something.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into trellising.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything about it.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.183 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what?

00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I just go
trellis it in a cacao tree?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So I took about four
or five cacao trees

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and put the vanillas
in, and it worked.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And it just went.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's now become a major
tourist attraction at our farm.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
People come to see the
cacao with the vanilla.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And does it change
the taste of the cacao?

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, they say that it
does, because they say

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
about chocolate--
chocolate acquires

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.627 align:middle line:84%
the flavors of the plants and
trees that it grows next to.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, around it.
Really?

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And so we're thinking--

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
So we have the cacao powder.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what-- I
mean, you really

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
got pretty much like a little
mocha latte right there

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like our vanilla
chocolate mocha thing going on.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I think they call it a zebra.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And right here is the
product of those cacao beans.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
That's cacao powder.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:90%
That's raw cacao powder.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the great
health food products that's

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
out there right now--
being able to get

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.267 align:middle line:84%
all of the goodies that's in
chocolate with zero sugar.

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing added.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just chocolate.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
benefits of cacao, I mean,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in its raw form like this?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Cacao is the
number one magnesium

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:90%
content food in the world.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one antioxidant
food that people eat as well.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, just on
those two principles--

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
because magnesium is the
number one mineral deficiency,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants are
associated with longevity--

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
it should probably increase your
lifespan, increase your health.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's
been shown-- that people

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
who eat chocolate live longer.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the highest
fraction of chocolate eaters

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
live the longest.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we recommend
natural chocolate.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I think it's so fun.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.776 align:middle line:84%
The last time you
were on the show,

00:08:00.776 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you did a whole
blender chef thing

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:90%
for us, which was so neat.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And you showed us how to make
different hot chocolates,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.954 align:middle line:84%
but out of this and
natural vanilla bean.

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: That's right.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have here-- this
is a great combination here.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
that mocha combo.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
This is something that was made
very popular on television,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:90%
green coffee bean extract.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
This stuff-- this
particular version

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.291 align:middle line:90%
of it's high octane fuel.

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to be
a little bit careful.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is a teaspoon with
maybe a tablespoon of that.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We could throw it in
a NutriBullet blender.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.454 align:middle line:84%
This is the blender that I
have on TV all over the place.

00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Just throw a couple
of those in there.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Throw some water in there.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:90%
Pop it in.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready to go.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Just to see how
this thing works--

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.401 align:middle line:84%
love this, because
there's no exposed blades.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:84%
Watch.
And we just go like that.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's on and then
it's off, just like that.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's your
instant mocha whatever.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Or whatever, yeah.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can do all kinds
of amazing things in there.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
I like to put a lot of berries
in there-- raspberry coconut,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
coconut water-- and then take
something that's interesting

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
here, maybe one of my super
herb formula combinations,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
like this 24 mushroom blend,
and then pop that in there.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not doing just like
raspberry and coconut water

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
or blueberry and coconut water
or banana, coconut water,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and raspberry.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually getting
very interesting, unique

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.681 align:middle line:84%
nutrients, immunological
nutrients, from the mushrooms.

00:09:14.681 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Let's talk about these.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%
These are in glass jars, right?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is Myron glass.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Overall, these here
are so amazing.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
This company that
makes Myron glass,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I finally met with the owners.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to meet with me,
because I've been promoting it

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
for all these years
and I never met

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
the people who run the company.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And we've become very good
friends, like best friends.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.466 align:middle line:90%
And they're in Europe.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:31.864 align:middle line:90%
They're based in Holland.

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And they produce the most
incredible glass in the world.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's
like a black glass.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can't--

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you get it
up into the light--

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
-I was just gonna do that.
-You can catch a violet hue.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.811 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's purple.
Yeah.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
And we call it the violet glass.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is going back
to the 1800s as to why

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:90%
this glass was developed.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And it preserves foods
that are in it better

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:90%
than any other type of glass.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And for our high end
products, what we like to do

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is put them into
the Myron glass,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
because it just adds
a touch of quality.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
This says freeze
dried mycelium.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.407 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually 24
different mushrooms from--

00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Mixed together.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Mixed together.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.173 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Mixed
together, yeah.

00:10:05.173 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: And the healing
properties of this is?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
This is immunological.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It's joint protective.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It's nervous system supporting.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
What we know about the mycelium
of mushrooms-- and these

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
are all tree
mushrooms, by the way.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So the medicinal mushrooms
are, for the most part,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.477 align:middle line:84%
with a few exceptions,
tree mushrooms.

00:10:20.477 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, really?
They're not in the ground?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's interesting
right there.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's a very
important point to bring out

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
to folks is hey, mushrooms
that grew out of trees are,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%
for the most part, medicinal.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And we should know that, because
if we cut all our trees down,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:84%
we're also getting rid of
all our medicinal compounds.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.217 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: All those
old growth trees.

00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
LISA CARR: Absolutely.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.127 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mycelium,
it's underneath.

00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
We did a whole show with Paul
Stamets, as you recommended.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
It's in the earth.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's in the earth.
And it's miles and miles below.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
-So it grows up and--

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, into
dead trees, but sometimes,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:90%
in living trees.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, chaga, which
is this mushroom right here,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:90%
grows in a living tree.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it has a
very unique property

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that it lives symbiotically
with a living tree.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Then what we found out,
especially over the last five

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
years-- this led me to write
a book on the subject--

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
is it's actually protecting
the immune system of the tree.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So they live together
symbiotically.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And they protect each
other, kind of like us

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
with our friendly bacteria.
Right?

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
We live symbiotically together.
-Interesting.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you have chaga
separated from the 24 blend?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.251 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what folks demand.

00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, OK.
I see.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:23.815 align:middle line:84%
I see.
-Yeah.

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons why
we do these kinds of products

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
is because in the old days,
the only kinds of products

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.291 align:middle line:84%
you could get in a health
food store were capsulated.

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-And then our crew came around.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We said, hey, we just want
to take a few berries,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
throw it in here
with some coconut

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
water or tea or something
and just throw a powder.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
open up capsules.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's just give
them the bulk powder

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and give them a
much better deal.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to save
about five times

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
the price just on a bulk
powder, because you don't

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
have to capsulate
it, so you just

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:90%
don't need all that technology.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
are now, is people

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:90%
are like, hey, I want the bulk.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I want the whole powder.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
they grow on dead trees?

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.836 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:11:58.836 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: They're a recycler.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, actually, I do know.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
interesting thing to me.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is the medicinal
mushrooms are tree mushrooms,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and they recycle wood.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And so their role
in the ecosystem

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:90%
is in a karma neutral place.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
They're allies to life,
but when the tree dies,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
they step in and recycle it and
make that food for more trees.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
They eat the wood.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.709 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: They eat the wood.
-Fascinating.

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they get to do their
thing of producing spores,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.457 align:middle line:90%
but the wood rots.

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: It decomposes.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And then it decomposes.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And then that's food
for the next layer

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:90%
of the forest to come up.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way we talk about
that is that these mushrooms

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:90%
are allies to life.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
For example, 24 mushroom
blend right here--

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
could you feed that your dog?

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you could.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
In nature, your dog's never
to be able to get that.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not gonna be able to eat
any of these kind of mushrooms.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But how could that be a medicine
for all mammals and reptiles

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and even fish and birds, which
is what the research indicates?

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they're allies to life.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something
that we all need.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And it supports
health, because it

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
gets into the depth and
understanding of what's

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
going on here on the planet.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We have allies that are
here on the planet with us.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And once we know
them and understand

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
their behavior and their
personality, they can help us.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I talk about
the medicinal mushrooms.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.737 align:middle line:84%
Are people that might
be allergic to mushrooms,

00:13:12.737 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
would they ever have an
allergy to something like this?

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They can.
Yeah.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
If you have a mushroom
allergy, you could be allergic

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.477 align:middle line:84%
to medicinal mushrooms.
It's possible.

00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So they're still
funguses, but they're,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
in a way, good funguses,
just like good bacteria

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:90%
is to the gut.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Exactly.
-I'm getting it.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.195 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yes, good
bacteria versus bad bacteria.

00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I got it.
DAVID WOLFE: Exactly.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: OK.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.177 align:middle line:84%
So now, back to our
beautiful cacao tree

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking at here.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So the cacao we saw
earlier, the buds

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
coming off of the tree that are
going to grow into bigger ones.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:10%
LISA CARR: This is the
inside of it, right?

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.986 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: This is the inside.

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:10%
So what we did here is
we had a fully ripe pod.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So those things
grow and they become

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:10%
a pod, like a Nerf football.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:10%
And then we broke that pod open.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And I got those fresh
beans, those fresh nuts.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a nut.
LISA CARR: Inside?

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: Chocolate is the
most widely eaten in the world

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.057 align:middle line:10%
that nobody actually eats.
LISA CARR: Yeah.

00:13:55.057 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WOLFE: Think
about that for a second.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:10%
Imagine if, all the
years of your life,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:10%
you always had almond powder,
you had almond butter,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.857 align:middle line:10%
you had almond oil.

00:14:01.857 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
One day, I came along and
said, here's an almond.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Here's the almond.
Right.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what this is.
LISA CARR: Right.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we did here is
we took the cacao bean out

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and we dehydrated them.
so they get that crunch,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:90%
that crispness.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, once
you break them open,

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.951 align:middle line:84%
you see their original and real
color, which is royal purple.

00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Really?
-Isn't that amazing?

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
When they dry,
they become brown?

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
When they sprout,
they turn brown.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, some
cacao varieties are

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:90%
a little bit whitish, purplish.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Some are rich purple like this.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Some are purple-brown.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And some are purple.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But generally, the tendency
is once they start sprouting,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:90%
then they go to brown.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the chocolate color
that we're all familiar with.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at that
closely, if you look at it,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:84%
you go, wait, there's a
little bit of purple in there.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
You can see it.
-Yeah, you could.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:90%
There's a little bit of a hue.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about critters
and squirrels and birds?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Do they just love these trees?

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Birds love chocolate trees.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's an incredible
research project

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that was done on
the amount of birds

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that are attracted into areas
where cacao trees are planted.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's something very
interesting going on that we

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:90%
don't really understand.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's at least 90 to even
160 species of birds that will

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
come into cacao plantings
and to cacao orchards that

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:90%
normally don't hang out there.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's exactly what
you want for these trees,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
because the bird poop
is super phosphate.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the best
fertilizer you got.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So if these birds are coming
into the cacao orchards--

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.529 align:middle line:84%
maybe they like the cacao fruit.
A lot of them do.

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Like, toucans love cacao.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And if they come in
there and they eat that

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.903 align:middle line:84%
and then they poop
there, then that's

00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the fertilizer for
these nut trees,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.941 align:middle line:84%
which need a lot of nutrition.
-Interesting.

00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But do they just kind
of take the trees apart?

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Or what do you do about that?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, in Hawaii,
we deal with chickens.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So I've got chickens roosting
in my cacao trees, which is not

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
the best thing ever most of the
time, because they pick around.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:90%
They tear up your garden a lot.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If you plant lettuce,
they tear it up.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.979 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
the chickens out.

00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:90%
But chickens love cacao trees.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They love roosting in them.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:90%
So they'll sleep in them.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Oh, in the tree?

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:90%
In the tree.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: How cute.
-Yeah, it's cool.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they kind of
work as a natural deterrent

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.664 align:middle line:90%
from the birds?

00:15:59.664 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:90%
You mean the chickens?

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.263 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yeah, do they?

00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, other birds--
in Hawaii, we

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
diversity of birds

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that you'd have in,
for example, Ecuador.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
These studies that I'm
talking about-- 90 to 160

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
different birds coming
into those areas--

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%
are in like Venezuela, Ecuador.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Those are places
like Peru, where

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
there's a tremendous
biodiversity of birds.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But all the birds
that exist in Hawaii,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:90%
they do come to the cacao trees.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They love it.
LISA CARR: Interesting.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
LISA CARR: All right.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.251 align:middle line:84%
All right.
And these are the leaves.

00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Yes.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
If I was walking
along a forest and I

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
saw these beautiful
leaves, I would know

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
there's something in there.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Isn't
that brilliant?

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: It's so
neat and so pretty.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: And again,
that's just an iPhone picture.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
This gives you an idea of
what the cacao's all about.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
You can see all the
colors of cacao there.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
You can see the green and
the purples and the reds.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But even almost the
dark browns are there.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we see here--

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and this particular
tree, I do want

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:90%
to mention a little bit about.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It just showed something
to me when it was a baby,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:90%
when it was about that big.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
There's two trees that I
put right next to the house,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:90%
to our ranch house.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.511 align:middle line:84%
And when they were babies,
this big, they showed to me

00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
something that was
like, wow, I'm going

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:90%
to keep an eye on that one.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And this one just had
this brilliance to it.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It just had this magic.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it went through
a major growth spurt

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:90%
last time I was here.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So I snapped this picture,
because that's the new growth.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're seeing there,
is those different colors.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the new leaves.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they'll turn green.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.741 align:middle line:84%
So cute-- you personify these
like they're little children.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
Right.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
If you take care of
like that, then they're

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
going to take on that
personality, that character,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that's really going to give
us the best quality chocolate.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
what I'm about,

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is hey, how do we make this
incredible, most well-loved

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:90%
food in the world even better?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So you harvest these,
and you take the food out

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and you dry it, and
grind it up and dry it?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Is that how it
gets to this stage?

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: That's right.
Well, this is pressed.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:90%
So the oil's been squished out.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.771 align:middle line:84%
And the cacao butter
is then over here.

00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
cacao butter here.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But cacao butter is a
really special, amazing oil.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And we all know how incredible
coconut oil is at this point.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.577 align:middle line:84%
Most of your fans are tuned
into the coconut oil revolution.

00:17:50.577 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But the cacao butter
revolution is even a bigger one,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's cocoa
butter, the real-- it's

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
like what was in
Coppertone lotion way,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.464 align:middle line:90%
way back in the old days.

00:17:59.464 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: It's cocoa butter.
-Yeah.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the real-- so
it has a little bit

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:90%
of sun tan properties.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Golden.
Yeah.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And it has the smell.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.914 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the
best thing ever.

00:18:06.914 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, it
sounds wonderful.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-It sounds tropical.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.169 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:10.169 --> 00:18:12.517 align:middle line:84%
So this is a beautiful picture
of-- what is this picture?

00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: This
is dragon fruit.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had an amazing
woman staying with me

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and she's been helping we
with the design of our farm

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and with work on
the farm for years.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And she came up one
night and she said,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the dragon fruits are flowering.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first time
they've ever flowered.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.531 align:middle line:84%
And I've had this tree, or
this-- it's not really a tree.

00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:29.871 align:middle line:84%
It's a vine.
It's a cactus that's a vine.

00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: OK.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: So I got it
in the right place finally.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But years, it
didn't do anything.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it flowered,
and flowers at night.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's pollinated by moths.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.924 align:middle line:84%
It's pollinated not by
bees, but by other critters.

00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Interesting.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: And then it
will close in the day.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to have fruits.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Does it
open to the moon?

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.413 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah,
it opens the moon.

00:18:46.413 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It responds to the moon.
Yeah.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Wow, interesting.
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.579 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Wow,
that's so beautiful.

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So you actually got a picture
of it flowering at night.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.283 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: So I came in
there at night with my iPhone

00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:54.317 align:middle line:90%
with a flash, got the pictures.

00:18:54.317 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: That's so fun.
-Isn't that great?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: I know.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:90%
You have such a fun life.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.871 align:middle line:84%
This is really cool.
What is this?

00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: OK.
This one shocks people.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
What you see here
is a cashew fruit.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:90%
That's where cashews come from.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.855 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: A cashew
nut is a fruit?

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: It's a fruit,
but the nut is so bizarre.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It sticks out of the bottom.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can see in that
lower quadrant there, I'm

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.343 align:middle line:84%
kind of turning the
thing upside down

00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm showing you
that nut sticking out

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of the bottom, which
has a shell around it.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you crack that, the
cashew nut is on the inside.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And you only get
one nut per fruit.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why cashews
are more expensive.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It's very labor intensive.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: And you never
see them in this form.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Never.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
You might, if you're
in Cuba maybe.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So maybe Costa Rica, maybe in a
market for one day, they last.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But those fruits go
bad very quickly.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically, you pick it.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's got one day on
the market shelf.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And then if it doesn't happen,
if somebody doesn't buy it,

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
you just crack the nuts
and use it for the nut.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
But you don't eat the fruit.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So is the nut, in its
raw form, very, very rich?

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's very rich.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's very oily
and juicy, actually.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:90%
The nut hardens.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And nuts in general harden,
whether it's cacao or macadamia

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
nut or pecans or
walnuts-- they are

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
harden once you break them out.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:90%
And then they start to dry out.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.524 align:middle line:84%
And once they dry out,
they have that crunch

00:20:06.524 --> 00:20:08.189 align:middle line:84%
that we're all familiar with.
-Right.

00:20:08.189 --> 00:20:09.366 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Let's see here.

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
What is this?
DAVID WOLFE: This is fun.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, being a fruit explorer and
researcher and a connaisseur

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
of exotic fruits from
around the world,

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
eventually, you come
head to head with durian.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Durian is that fabled
fruit that all raw foodists

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
are talking about.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
It's that fabled fruit from
Southeast Asia that smells.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It's banned on
trains in Singapore.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a fruit that's
got a big spiky

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
exterior, but an
absolutely intense smell.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It smells like a
sulfur-- you know

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
how sulfur sometimes
comes out of your oven

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.634 align:middle line:90%
if you have an old gas oven?

00:20:44.634 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And they designed
it so that they'd

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
give a smell to the sulfur
so you could-- or to the gas?

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're by
sulfur hot springs.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Sulfur hot springs
is like that too.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:90%
That's how durian smells.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's something you
either love it or hate it.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a rotten egg thing.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.767 align:middle line:84%
And in this
particular case, I was

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
on the big island of Hawaii.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine, who I
hadn't seen in many years,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.099 align:middle line:90%
she called me up.

00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, my durians are
fruiting, or they're flowering.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to come check it
out and see if you can help me.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is
I went and I trimmed

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:90%
out all the small flowers.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I trimmed out
everything so that what

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
had been actually
pollinated is going

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.327 align:middle line:90%
to carry fruit right to term.

00:21:18.327 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh my gosh.
-Yeah.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.406 align:middle line:84%
So I went in just
kind of helped it

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
along, because this is the first
year of her durians flowering.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So I went in there and kind of
trimmed out about 65% maybe 70%

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
of the flowers, and then let
the ones that had already

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
been pollinated have
a little bit of room

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
so that they're going to make
it all the way to a full fruit.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So that more of the nutrition
goes to those particular--

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Exactly.
Yes.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from
you over the years.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah,
you're getting it.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Over the years-- all right.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And this, this is really neat.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: This is nutmeg.
LISA CARR: Nutmeg.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.056 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Nutmeg, yeah.

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:45.687 align:middle line:84%
And in the holidays, we
all know about nutmeg.

00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see right there, it
looks like heart and lungs.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It has a very sensual
appearance, as well.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Interesting.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.173 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: And
one of things you

00:21:51.173 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
see there is that red that's
around a black nut underneath.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
The red is the mace.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:90%
We've heard of nutmeg mace.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And nutmeg mace has
the same qualities

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:90%
as the nutmeg nut itself.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It has a slightly
higher vibration.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit fruitier.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit brighter.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to really
make a special nutmeg drink,

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
like a special eggnog
that has no egg in it,

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
use mace, right?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.324 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna have a
fruitier, brighter flavor.

00:22:17.324 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But what you could do is
you could take the mace--

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
or let's say you use up all the
mace and get the red stuff off.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got
a nut underneath.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.924 align:middle line:84%
I crack that nut open, and there
you have your normal nutmeg

00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
that we're used to that
we'd buy in a store,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.909 align:middle line:84%
like a whole nutmeg.
-They're brownish.

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the brownish thing.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of spotted.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you grate it,
you can see those spots.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And those grated pieces
would go into your eggnog

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever kind of pie
you're making or whatever.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I put it into green
tea, which I love.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
When I make a little green
tea coconut milk latte,

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I put the nutmeg in there.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.399 align:middle line:84%
I love it.
It's so good.

00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of nutmeg.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to be
careful with nutmeg.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.290 align:middle line:90%
You can overdose.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
That medicine-toxin
barrier is very low.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a certain
amount you can use.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Normally, people just
grate a little bit, put it

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.509 align:middle line:84%
in their drinks, no big deal.
LISA CARR: Yeah.

00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually did
half a nutmeg in one drink,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:84%
that could be too much.
LISA CARR: Really?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:90%
So over medicinal, meaning?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's over medicinal.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:90%
It's little bit psychoactive.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Some people get a liver
toxic reaction to it.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's kind of a
barrier-- not too much.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.881 align:middle line:84%
We've heard a lot
about cinnamon lately.

00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:17.824 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
-It's been in the news.

00:23:17.824 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: I like cinnamon.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.554 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan.

00:23:19.554 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: We don't have
any pictures of cinnamon.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.351 align:middle line:84%
But what are some of
the medicinal properties

00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
of cinnamon?
And in what form, though?

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
When we see it in the
store in the little jars

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
with the sticks, are those
even worth it anymore?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Do they have any properties
of healing in them anymore?

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.896 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
the right cinnamon.

00:23:32.896 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
There's actually two types of
cinnamon being sold in stores.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: OK.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is the
wrong type of cinnamon.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's in the right genus,
but it's the wrong species.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So you just need
to do a little--

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:42.876 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: How'd you know?

00:23:42.876 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Bit of internet research.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go to a website
or you've got to go to a person

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
like a store or shop that
differentiates it and says,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
this is the real
original cinnamon.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.574 align:middle line:84%
The real original cinnamon
has a richer flavor.

00:23:53.574 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little
bit more bite to it.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.661 align:middle line:84%
It has a thicker bark, because
cinnamon is a tree bark.

00:23:58.661 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And cinnamon, when they
finally analyzed what's in it--

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
it's super high in chromium,
like cacao is, which means

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:90%
it's blood sugar regulating.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's anti-diabetic.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's recommended--

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.133 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: That's why.

00:24:11.133 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:90%
As a longevity substance.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a tendency in
your family towards diabetes,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
then it's kind of
the natural thing

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
you would want to have to kind
of keep that tendency at bay.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So can you have children
maybe chew on cinnamon

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.591 align:middle line:84%
sticks instead of have
ridiculous sugar cravings.

00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Totally.
Yeah.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: So that's a
great way to kind of--

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a great way to go.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Adjust the sugar
cravings in kids.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:90%
These are beautiful.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a plum, a wild
plum from the Northern

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Territory of Australia.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.925 align:middle line:90%
It's called the kakadu plum.

00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out it's
the highest vitamin C

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
content food in the world.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.297 align:middle line:84%
This is?
DAVID WOLFE: This is it.

00:24:47.297 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:90%
This is it right here.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And it has a stone in it.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's really like a plum, like
a plum you'd buy in a store,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
except it has a much
thinner level of flesh.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And it has almost like a
gelatinous similar to berries

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:90%
type of consistency.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
You kind of chew through
it, and you're like, oh,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of like a
jell-o kind of feeling,

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
like a gelatinous
type of feeling.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And aboriginal people used to
just put a bunch in their mouth

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and just chew it and
chew it and chew it.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
super high in vitamin C,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very powerful
hydration agent.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's digestively
friendly, as all

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
the berries are and all these
high-pectin type of fruits are.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
This gelatinous quality, we
call a demulcent quality.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And that demulcent quality is
very friendly to digestion.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's very soft.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you've had a history of
Celiac's disease or Chrone's

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
or autoimmune conditions
with the digestive track

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
or we just get our
diverticulitis or something

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
like that, then we
want to do things

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that are not too
fibrous-- not like kale,

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
that can be too much.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
We've got to do things that
are soft and gelatinous, like

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
the kakadu plum or
plums in general

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
or berries or raspberries
or marshmallow

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.511 align:middle line:84%
root tea, one of my favorites.
LISA CARR: Right.

00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Right.
I remember that.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Slippery elm bark is like
that, has that quality.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Digestive aids.
-Digestive aids.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Chia seed's like that.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Chia seeds there.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Ch-ch-ch chia.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.281 align:middle line:84%
And then those turn into a
thick kind of a gelatinous--

00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:84%
That's that demulcent quality
that we're looking for.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:84%
See, when you take chia seeds
and you soak them in water,

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get that
jelling quality to come out.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you consume that as
a pudding, for example--

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I like to put berries
in there, again,

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.367 align:middle line:90%
for that demulcent quality.

00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I like to put honey in
there, because honey is

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:84%
pretty friendly to digestion.
-Nice.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to put
slippery elm in there.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:84%
If I can get marshmallow root
powder, I'll put that in there.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I've
got a digestive tonic

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.484 align:middle line:84%
that's also very nourishing--
complete protein.

00:26:32.484 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Do you
eat it like oatmeal?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's a breakfast.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens for me,
though, is it's breakfast,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.205 align:middle line:84%
then it's lunch,
then it's dinner.

00:26:39.205 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Yes.
Yes.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I just stay with it.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.309 align:middle line:84%
-Because it's so good.
-It's so good.

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
How long do you soak
the seeds before they--

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Eight minutes,
eight to 10 minutes.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it warm water?
Or does it matter?

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Warm water's fine.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:90%
But I like-- it depends.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:84%
If you really like a hot
oatmeal in the morning,

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
switch from oats, which
are very mucous-driving and

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
mucous-forming, and
you switch to chia,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can get a similar
consistency, a lot lighter.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot lighter.
-Interesting.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It feels lighter.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.669 align:middle line:84%
And then you can maybe
put a few raw nuts in there

00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and some berries? or no?
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
You can put nuts and
berries in There.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do that.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I did-- what'd I
do the other day?

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: It sounds so good
with some honey right now,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:84%
just that--
-Oh, doesn't that sound great?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: It
sounds so good, yes.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I brought some honey for you.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I got some.
LISA CARR: Oh, some [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-OK.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
What else do we
have here in your--

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
This is one of our top
selling products right here.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a very interesting
research project

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was involved
in for years to try

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
to mix a powder into water and
make it taste good with nothing

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Just powder into water, and
make it work, where people go,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:90%
that's good.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.584 align:middle line:84%
And that became
a product we call

00:27:33.584 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Immortal Machine,
which is actually

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:84%
our number one selling product.
-Now, what is in it?

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful drink mix.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And what it is it's
cacao, it's shilajit,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:90%
it's leukoma, it's maca.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
We have a few interesting
ingredients in there

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:90%
like white kidney bean extract.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:90%
It's mucuna.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.844 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of superfoods
and super herbs together.

00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
combination that I'm

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:90%
always telling people about.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:90%
One day, that just click in.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Super
foods and super hers.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Superfoods and super herbs
together-- that magical combo.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, the only thing green
I'm seeing here is your shirt.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that you used to
be a full green food addict.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Why no greens?

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm assuming that folks
are doing their green juices.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a different direction,
where the market evolved.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And so I just rolled with that.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.304 align:middle line:84%
You can put these
in your green juices?

00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:19.003 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:19.003 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You can put it in
your green juices.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I was on a plane flight from
Amsterdam to Los Angeles,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.029 align:middle line:90%
about a 13-hour flight.

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:26.694 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty intense flight.
LISA CARR: Yeah.

00:28:26.694 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And about six hours into it,
I hadn't drank water in days.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I was really
dehydrated and I was

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.966 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of that flight.

00:28:32.966 --> 00:28:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And I had had a fresh
organic orange juice

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.261 align:middle line:84%
at Schiphol Airport before
getting on the flight.

00:28:38.261 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: OK.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
maybe possibly they

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
would have fresh orange
juice on this flight.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It's KLM Airlines-- maybe.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Who knows?
LISA CARR: Right.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.949 align:middle line:90%
So I get up.

00:28:46.949 --> 00:28:48.311 align:middle line:84%
I'm wandering the
cabin deliriously.

00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a 747.
There was 540 people on board.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm wandering around.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the curtains open and I look
into the flight attendant area,

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and I see an orange juice.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, maybe.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:90%
So I stick my head in there.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I say to the flight
attendant, I say,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't happen to be
like a fresh orange juice

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything, would it?

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the guy goes, you're
David Wolfe, aren't you?

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Oh, no way.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:90%
He recognized me.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, oh, man.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of the sudden, he busts
out this liter and a half

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:90%
of superfood super herb drink.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It was an impossible situation.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.779 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god.
You are lucky.

00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:24.777 align:middle line:90%
He says, do you want some?

00:29:24.777 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
-Are you kidding?
-Do you want some?

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yes, I do.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We sit back there in the flight
attendant little cabin area.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're drinking
this amazing smoothie,

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:90%
having the best time ever.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But he had it-- I would
have that in coconut water.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
He had it in kale juice.
LISA CARR: OK.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't exactly-- it was
kind of a mess on that point.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
You got so lucky there.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It was so-- I was
like, I'll take it.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.581 align:middle line:84%
Yes, kale juice.
I'll take it.

00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Only flight attendants can get
that type of stuff on a plane,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
though, because
you couldn't carry

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:90%
that through security, sadly.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.240 align:middle line:84%
It was totally
impossible, what happened.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
smiling, laughing.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
11 hours into the flight-- I had
been back to my seat by then.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably watched "Rocky
VI" about three or four times

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.674 align:middle line:90%
by that point.

00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sitting in my seat.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, somebody
comes over, and I look up,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's him.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And he pulls down the tray.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And he puts a napkin down.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And he puts a cup down.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.065 align:middle line:90%
And he has more.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:90%
He had another bottle.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's serving me at my
table, just to do that.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
You're just the luckiest
guy on the planet.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It was really a special moment.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
You make people feel
good about themselves

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and feel good inside,
which is important.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a very important
part of healing, by the way.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.964 align:middle line:10%
The doomsday report idea
is a terrible idea--

00:30:34.964 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:10%
this whole thing of like
well, you went to the doctor

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:10%
and he said, you have
six weeks to live.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:10%
LISA CARR: Yes.
-That is the worst thing ever.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
You always want to be
positive and hope-giving

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:84%
force in the world, because
the other idea is terrible.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like, let's work with hope.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, I mean, when you a
sustainable type of environment

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:10%
inside your body, then
the right neurochemicals

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:10%
produce, then the
happy hormones produce,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:10%
and then you feel good.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So those negative thoughts
start to quiet down

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're more attracted to
the positive things in life.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one
of the main reasons

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.739 align:middle line:84%
for nutritional supplementation.
DAVID WOLFE: Yes.

00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
It's because it
makes you feel better.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Happy food.
The happy food group.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.421 align:middle line:84%
Happy food, happy
thoughts, right.

00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So OK.
What do you take?

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody wants to know?
-What I'm doing.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
On your comments on
Instagram it all says,

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I want what he's having.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So what is your-- you
brought your medicine bag.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah, I
brought my medicine bag.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:90%
We should probably get that out.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, and we haven't
talked about this fun thing

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:84%
yet.
-OK.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is orgonite.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And these are flakes
of metal and crystals

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:90%
all crushed to a fine powder.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there's 30, maybe
31, different crystals

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.631 align:middle line:84%
and metals in here, like
copper flakes, gold flakes,

00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
silver flakes.
-Oh, how pretty.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And then layers and layers
and layers of crushed crystals

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and moldavite and all this
kind of stuff, and then

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:90%
a flower of life image on top.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And I use this in my car.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll sit on this.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It looks very much
like the Gaiam flower.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:84%
-It is like that, absolutely.
-Yeah, it is.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
You can see the Gaiam
flower right in here.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.359 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:31:57.359 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on that
flower of life symbology.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we do with this is I'll

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
put my supplements on it.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:84%
As long as I'm going to
have them sitting there,

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
this thing emits
an energy field.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
you can detect.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Like when I was driving
across the desert--

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I got this from a friend
of mine in Arizona--

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.190 align:middle line:84%
drove across the desert
all the way back to LA.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:90%
It's about a 10 hour drive.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.357 align:middle line:84%
And I sat on this thing,
and I had the energy for 10

00:32:16.357 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:84%
hours, got all the way back.
-You're kidding?

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it's orgonite.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:84%
It was developed by Wilhelm
Reich, who was a very, very

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
famous researcher into
alternative energy

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:90%
systems back in the '50s.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've gotten to
this level with the orgonite.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So I'll have this in my car--

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:32.951 align:middle line:90%
It's quite large.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, I'll sit on it.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.217 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it's quite heavy.
-It is heavy.

00:32:35.217 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And what is it encased in?

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
It's encased in a
silicone-- it's silicone.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that pretty?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's a resin.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:90%
That is gorgeous.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it sparkles.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.534 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
natural materials?

00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Those are all natural
materials, yes.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:90%
That is really beautiful.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is attracts, according
to Wilhelm Reich, good energy,

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:84%
positive energies
that are naturally

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:90%
present in the environment.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
concentrator of those.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:90%
That is beautiful.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.490 align:middle line:90%
That's really pretty.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Isn't
that brilliant?

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So this emits an
energy-- I'm sure you

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.321 align:middle line:84%
can even get the energy in the
resonance of the camera image

00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:84%
too.
That's just the way it works.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Right, yeah.
-Yeah.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.
You can feel it.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I just leave it around
just to see what happens.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And people will be
like, what's that?

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And they'll just
put stuff on it.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I use it like a plate,
like you'd eat off of.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But I put all my things on it
just to kind of charge them up,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:90%
just because it's interesting.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Don't
leave home without it.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You were taking a
nap on that earlier.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.020 align:middle line:90%
That's really cool.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's bring this up here.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
What I do oftentimes,
if I'm traveling--

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You wanna put it on here?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll just put
it right on there.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
This is my medicine bag.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me about
this all the time.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:90%
This is well-traveled.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:90%
This is a well-traveled bag.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
This thing has been
around the world with me.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
thing for 10 years.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's an old camera
bag that, one day-- I

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.154 align:middle line:84%
can't remember exactly what
my original medicine bag was.

00:33:45.154 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
maybe three of them.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-One day, that thing went caput.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.234 align:middle line:84%
And I emptied out the camera
equipment and thought,

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
this thing looks like
it's going to work.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've got all
kinds of cool stuff.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
I've got wooden spoons.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.509 align:middle line:84%
OK.
That's cool.

00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Wooden knives.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get stopped
at security for these.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:90%
They never take anything out.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.241 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always pack this in
the main luggage that goes in.

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, OK.
-OK.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to open this up.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly how I travel.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
see it for reals--

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:90%
That's so fun.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:90%
As we say in LA.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
-We've all wanted to know.
-OK.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So I have pictures of my cacao
farm here for inspiration.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that right there.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a little sticker.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are some of the
pictures we just saw.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.386 align:middle line:84%
And then right at the
top, this is something

00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:90%
I've been traveling with.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a gift for my birthday--
reishi mushroom spores.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's powerful stuff.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Powerful stuff, as Ron
Teeguarden would tell you.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:84%
This is even more powerful than
the reishi mushroom itself.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
And we just blend this
right into drinks.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we
could put into a NutriBlast

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:38.770 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of cacao
and berries and coconut water.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're ready
to rock and roll.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is how-- you just
start mixing things on the road.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.654 align:middle line:84%
You go and you just
find water or whatever

00:34:45.654 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and you just mix it up.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.486 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: And just mix it up.

00:34:47.486 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in Hawaii
or in Indonesia,

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
I've got access to
incredible coconuts.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.854 align:middle line:84%
I'm popping coconut water
into the NutriBullet.

00:34:53.854 --> 00:34:55.167 align:middle line:90%
I'm popping in there berries.

00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm popping in
there coconut meat.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.999 align:middle line:90%
This kind of stuff.

00:34:56.999 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that sound like a
better idea than fast food?

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.259 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's like--

00:35:00.259 --> 00:35:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, your own fast food.
Yeah.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.661 align:middle line:84%
This is the fastest food ever.
OK.

00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So I've got that.
So we'll put that over here.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, over here, this was a
gift that was given to me.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.290 align:middle line:90%
This is honey.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.700 align:middle line:90%
You can see how it's sealed in.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's signed by my
friends who raise these bees.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:84%
This is from their CoSM
Farm-- Alex and Allyson Grey,

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
who are very well known
for their visionary art.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And they gave that to me
as a birthday present.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.533 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that brilliant?

00:35:22.533 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Alex Grey-- oh, very nice.
Wow.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.451 align:middle line:84%
I was just with
them at their farm.

00:35:25.451 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's their first
batch of honey they ever got.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.894 align:middle line:84%
That's so beautiful.
OK.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I travel with honey
a lot, because I've

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
found, being an airplanes,
your throat gets dried out.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You start to get
build up of irritation

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:84%
because of all the stuff you're
breathing in, the dry air.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Honey just soothes
that over right away.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Anti-inflammatory
properties in honey?

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, very much so.
-Very much so.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And anti-aging properties.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Honey, to me, is one
of the great foods.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a believer in
what Rudolf Steiner said.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no better food
to add to your diet

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%
than the right amount of
honey, which is different.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Depends on where you
are-- if you're sugar

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.281 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, the right amount.
-OK.

00:35:57.281 --> 00:35:59.321 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-This is beautiful.

00:35:59.321 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
God's nectar.
-OK.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.219 align:middle line:84%
-OK.
-Now, let's see.

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:02.861 align:middle line:84%
If I go in here, let's
see what else we've got.

00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:04.650 align:middle line:84%
OK.
So I'm gonna open up this.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
This is wild.
So this is my ormus right here.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:90%
This is my ormus gold.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And let's see.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.986 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little
bit right there.

00:36:10.986 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's my ormus
gold right there.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.481 align:middle line:84%
People ask me,
how do I use this?

00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
This is how I use it.
-Yeah.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Watch what I do?

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
-No way.
-Yeah.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes right in.
It goes right into your skin.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:20.996 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes right in.

00:36:20.996 --> 00:36:23.250 align:middle line:84%
If I put it on my hand,
it'll just disappear.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:90%
It'll just rub right in.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.440 align:middle line:84%
What is ormus gold?
It's a mineral?

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a product
that we've been working with.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a mineral.
It's made out of gold.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.671 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes right into you.
So it's just--

00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Nice.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It falls into you, because
the molecular size is so small.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you wanna try some?
LISA CARR: Yes, I do.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beauty product.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you just can
rub that right in.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's like water.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like water, yeah.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And people say, you're
just selling people water.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you take that stuff
and you put it out in the sun,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that it's definitely
not water, because the stuff

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:90%
will precipitate out.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.797 align:middle line:84%
It'll turn back
to colloidal gold.

00:36:52.797 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh, that's
so interesting.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.729 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:36:54.729 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do believe doing
this, by the way--

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and I do this almost every
day with my ormus gold.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It falls into your brain.
LISA CARR: Really?

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The substance is falling
into your brain, yeah.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It goes right through.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we've
learned from the molecular size

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:90%
of the substance.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.691 align:middle line:84%
And people say, how do you
remember all that stuff?

00:37:08.691 --> 00:37:10.060 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: No way.
-It might be related.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:90%
I think it's related.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I do, because I've been
doing this since 2006.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.630 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get the
fabulous hair that you

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:90%
get, just ormus gold hair.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Ormus gold.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:90%
And what else do I have here?

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got--
OK, let's find this.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:90%
This is-- oh, this is fun.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.800 align:middle line:90%
This was a gift for my birthday.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is goji berry extract.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's delicious
and fun to play with.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite gifts
is to get things like this.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yes.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, it was like,
get a little thing for your car

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
or get something for your house.
LISA CARR: Right.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.601 align:middle line:84%
But better tools are the
ones that you use on yourself.

00:37:38.601 --> 00:37:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you're the best
machine in the universe.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-OK, so you wanna try this?

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-OK.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:84%
-On your tongue?
-It's good, yeah.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.419 align:middle line:84%
-Rich, huh?
-Wow.

00:37:48.419 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:90%
That packs a wallop.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're on a flight.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:90%
You're five hours out of Taiwan.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.130 align:middle line:90%
You're on your way to Hawaii.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:90%
One of those, boom.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
You're like, yep,
everything's good.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.170 align:middle line:84%
How many goji berries
are-- oh, that's so good.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.403 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah,
so check that out.

00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
That is really nice.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.490 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: I didn't
make that one myself.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Wolfberry.
DAVID WOLFE: Yep.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't make that one myself,
so I don't know exactly

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.605 align:middle line:90%
how they concentrated it.

00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: You would think--
it's called wolfberry.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It would be the
right thing to take.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.184 align:middle line:84%
You can see how beat
up my whole bag is--

00:38:13.184 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: I love this.
This is a great.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
-This thing is beat up here.
-This is the--

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:84%
This is my iodine
that I travel with.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you take iodine.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm on
the electrodine.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.964 align:middle line:84%
So I'm almost out.
I'm at the bottom.

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just doing like one
or two or three drops a day.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Because of thyroid?

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because of
the nuclear radiation

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and pollution that's in
the northern hemisphere

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
And it is a concern.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.411 align:middle line:90%
It's a significant concern.

00:38:32.411 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Especially when
you are in airplanes a lot.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:34.909 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of chemical
fallout that contains bromides.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's chlorine
and fluorine in water.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
To protect yourself from
those toxic halogens,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I recommend iodine.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:84%
This iodine's
actually too strong.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.910 align:middle line:90%
I usually use nascent iodine.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.261 align:middle line:84%
This is the Edgar
Cayce electrodine.

00:38:49.261 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh.
OK.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing this
in like high dosages,

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was whacking me out,
because it was too strong.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So I had to cut my
dosage down to one

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:90%
or two or three drops a day.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
any thyroid issues.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:84%
If you did, would
this be a problem?

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, it might be good
if your thyroid's low.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the situation.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:84%
When people are taking T3 or T4,
when they're taking a thyroid

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:84%
supplement or Synthroid
or even Armor,

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they're actually taking
an iodine supplement.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:90%
The T3 means it's three iodines.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:90%
T4 means four iodines.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's iodine.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So Synthroid is an
iodine supplement.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.997 align:middle line:84%
-Does it contain iodine in it?
-Yeah.

00:39:20.997 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It contains iodine in it.
-Oh, it does.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking T3, for
example, which is Synthroid,

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.641 align:middle line:84%
then you're actually
getting three iodines.

00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.520 align:middle line:84%
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that.
OK, that's why.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.560 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: So that's a
cool thing to travel with.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.413 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: And let's see
what else we've got here.

00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is my
favorite right now.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
-What's that?
-This is the Hops X Factor.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You can see how beaten
up that thing is.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is a super
powerful similar compound

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:90%
to resveratrol.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the most
powerful anti-aging compound

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:90%
that I know of, for sure.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're noticing, actually,
it has many other benefits.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It has been very
heavily researched

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:84%
in the sciences--
over 200 studies

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:90%
on this particular product.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And we introduced it
to the human market,

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
because it had only been
in research circles before.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Research on?

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Research on animals, on people.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They'd done-- for example,
there was a human study

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:84%
done on isoprostanes
where they were

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
studying the stress
effect of this product

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:90%
on people over three weeks.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They found out that
one dose, which

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is that right there, a day
for three weeks would lower

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
isoprostanes-- I think
it was 36%, which

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:90%
is more than anything else.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Isoprostanes are a
marker of stress.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
If your isoprostanes are
elevated, you're in stress.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of
helping to fortify

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.570 align:middle line:84%
your stress defense shield.
You wanna try it?

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Hops.
And is it actual--

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.491 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: It's an
extract of hops pollen.

00:40:35.491 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:90%
So this isn't--

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: It's
called xanthohumol.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.396 align:middle line:90%
That's the name of the compound.

00:40:38.396 --> 00:40:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But if someone is allergic
to wheat, not a problem?

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah,
there's no gluten in it.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:90%
There's-- obviously.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.899 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah,
it's gluten-free.

00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:90%
We're having fun here.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Try to talk.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.308 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Doesn't it
taste a little bit like beer?

00:40:48.308 --> 00:40:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
I hate beer.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no alcohol
in it, either.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is something I've been
megadosing on since April.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.287 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
noticing-- I'm gonna

00:40:57.287 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
do a little dose right here.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:90%
How's that treating you?

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
bit of water there.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:90%
See, I just do it like this.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yes, you do.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm not a beer fan.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.954 align:middle line:90%
But that's fabulous.

00:41:09.954 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: All right.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
take the edge off.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.110 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna help her out here.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've got.
I've got--

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.241 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Wow.
-OK.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Over here.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.906 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: No, you know what?

00:41:18.906 --> 00:41:20.411 align:middle line:84%
That actually--
-Here we go.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Nope.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.470 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Goji schizandra-- that'll
takethe the edge right off.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.501 align:middle line:84%
This is Ron's product,
Ron Teeguarden's product.

00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.800 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: That's gonna
take the edge off for you.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
You can taste that one
through the camera.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is powerful.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:90%
No need for coffee here.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been traveling with
this stuff for a month.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.947 align:middle line:84%
I have a dent-- like
this is eucommia.

00:41:52.947 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my favorites.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's get an image of that.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.556 align:middle line:90%
We should look at this.

00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:56.460 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: What is this?

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.971 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorites of all time

00:41:57.971 --> 00:41:58.870 align:middle line:90%
of all herbs in the whole--

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: I'm really
impressed that you

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.070 align:middle line:90%
can actually talk right now.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:90%
On the whole planet.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You can see I do this
stuff quite a bit, right?

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.039 align:middle line:84%
I live on the stuff.
-My tongue is--

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm on the
go, I don't have time--

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:90%
there's no fast food.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.811 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I can get to a
health food store in Indonesia.

00:42:09.811 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I just do a little bit of
this, a little bit of that,

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, boom.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I get going for the next hour.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.230 align:middle line:90%
The next two hours.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Eucommia-- this is a tree bark.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the most fabled tree
bark in Chinese medicine.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's considered one of the
top herbs in Chinese medicine.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And it has a tremendous history.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It was one time a
tree that dominated

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:84%
the earth, like gingko did.
LISA CARR: Really?

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And it had become
almost extinct

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the
world and had been

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:90%
narrowed to one area of China.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, these great Taoist
immortals had figured out,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.041 align:middle line:84%
my god, there's something
amazing about this tree.

00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:40.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's in the bark.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
alcohol-soluble substance

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that seals in your joints
and protects your joints.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It seals in your uterus, for
example, if you're pregnant.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the number one
recommended pregnancy herb

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:52.936 align:middle line:90%
And what's this called again?

00:42:52.936 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's called eucomma--
E, U, C, O, M, M, I, A.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this form, the way it's
delivered here in an alcohol

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:84%
tincture is really effective,
because the latexy material

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.390 align:middle line:84%
that's in it-- sort of
temperate climate rubber tree--

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.360 align:middle line:90%
is alcohol-soluble.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So it just gets
right to the joints.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way I became super
convinced about this product--

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Wow.
It's dark.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.470 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: And you can
just try a little drop.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Just try a little drop-- not
too much, because it's strong.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.674 align:middle line:84%
What happened for me is that--
-Very barky.

00:43:20.674 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: I had busted
up these two knuckles

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.170 align:middle line:90%
pretty badly.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of a couple
months of being on the road,

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:90%
they weren't well.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I was getting worried
that I'd jam them.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And really, something
was going on.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:90%
I came back to LA.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, OK,
I gotta dress this.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I got to get some eucommia.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.804 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I did
four droppers full.

00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: The full thing?

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.704 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I did four
droppers full right here.

00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: This is for people
that have broken bones.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or who have
joint issues, or who

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.280 align:middle line:84%
want to seal their uterus
in for a pregnancy.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's recommended.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And so I did four droppers full.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna do one here.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.694 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Oh my god.

00:43:56.694 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.181 align:middle line:84%
That is like pretty
much eating a tree trunk.

00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:84%
-Mmhm.
-Yeah.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
It's tree bark.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.702 align:middle line:90%
It's tree bark.

00:44:03.702 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:90%
You're like--

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It is like-- I feel like
a turtle for a second.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Back to normal now.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.940 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: I mean a frog.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.291 align:middle line:84%
I did four droppers full,
and the pain was gone.

00:44:14.291 --> 00:44:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And my knuckles had
been there for months.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing went
away in one day.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I got into this.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa, I have
arthritis in my family.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.291 align:middle line:84%
I have the tendency
towards that genetically.

00:44:25.291 --> 00:44:25.990 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I'm like, boom,
I'm on the preventative program.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: This is so fun.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, gosh, if anything
that we're learning here

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a remedy in
nature for every single ailment

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:90%
that we could possibly have.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:38.850 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: It's always there.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And nature responds
with what you need.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And we have so much access.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
really trying to do

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.021 align:middle line:84%
is get people to just
access what we can get to.

00:44:47.021 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yes.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Just open up to what's there,
because when you're dealing

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.504 align:middle line:84%
with the most powerful herbs
in the world, like eucommia,

00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:90%
you're dealing with some--

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:56.303 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: That is powerful.

00:44:56.303 --> 00:44:57.811 align:middle line:84%
It took that out in one day.
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:44:57.811 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Right?
This is not herb number 333.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.804 align:middle line:90%
It's not herb 1,111.

00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't care what those are.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:90%
It's too far down the list.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.490 align:middle line:90%
We wanna get to the top.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.365 align:middle line:90%
This is 5,000 years of history.

00:45:06.365 --> 00:45:08.099 align:middle line:84%
-History-- it's time proven.
-Yes.

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's worked for
generations and generations.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.071 align:middle line:84%
But it's also something that
we don't know about a lot.

00:45:13.071 --> 00:45:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Kyolic.
DAVID WOLFE: Recognize that one?

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Kyolic.
-Yeah.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.440 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: So this is
the Kyolic vegetarian

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.450 align:middle line:90%
formula for garlic extract.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:90%
That's an aged garlic extract.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So if I need the power
of garlic-- for example,

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these herbs are really
good against most things.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But flu viruses--
garlic nails it.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Antifungal, antiviral.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Anti-- yeah.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And garlic-- I always
have a bottle this

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.800 align:middle line:84%
whenever I'm doing a
retreat especially,

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:84%
if I'm doing a retreat in
Hawaii or Indonesia or Peru,

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.967 align:middle line:84%
because if somebody
gets sick, I can get

00:45:38.967 --> 00:45:39.900 align:middle line:90%
them a little bit of iodine.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I can get them a
little bit of garlic.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It's something
they're familiar with.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Throw it in a little bit
of water, they drink that.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually within an hour
or two, it's gone.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:84%
If it starts to come
back, I do another dose.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And within one day, we
usually nip it in the bud.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Nip the flu right away.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is for early symptoms
and so forth of the flu.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:90%
You can get it out right away.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Right away.
Exactly.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.400 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: So I'm gonna
put that back in there.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.433 align:middle line:90%
And then I've got other things.

00:45:59.433 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a nettle extract that
a friend of mine made for me.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Good for what?

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's anti-inflammatory
and it's an anti-histamine.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's anti-allergy.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.215 align:middle line:84%
And I have very bad allergies.
-Really?

00:46:09.215 --> 00:46:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a history of
very bad allergies.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:10.919 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:10.919 --> 00:46:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if
my allergies act up,

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
it's like an
autoimmune condition.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It takes me a while to
calm the whole thing down.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So I need certain things.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Nettle helps to just
bring it back down.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.580 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: What about eczema?

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Eczema is like an
autoimmune condition as well.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that
when it gets triggered,

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.190 align:middle line:84%
it's a hard trick to get
that whole thing calmed down

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back down again.
LISA CARR: Yes.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are herbs
that help in that regard.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They're anti-autoimmune,
or dual directional.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Reishi mushroom is like that.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Schizandra berry is like that.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Nettle is like that.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It can help to bring
those overreactions back

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:90%
into control.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So when the histamine does
not react as well as it should,

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.570 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you have low
histamine-- people with low

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.620 align:middle line:84%
thyroid usually have low
histamine in the body, which

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:84%
means it doesn't react
well to scratches,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.530 align:middle line:84%
bites, anything, or eczema.
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.631 align:middle line:84%
So this can actually lower
the histamine response?

00:46:59.631 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Exactly.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.480 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Like, it works
like a natural anti-histamine?

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, that's right.
-Exactly.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.140 align:middle line:84%
-That is brilliant.
-It's amazing.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what
nature can give us.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is herbalism, really.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.810 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: I can see
why it's so exciting.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Herbalism fosters
ecological literacy.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.060 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to be a.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Genius you don't need
to know 500 herbs.

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.230 align:middle line:84%
You just need to know like five
or 10 that you actually use.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.125 align:middle line:90%
That's it-- for your life.

00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But few of them
have side effects--

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:84%
like on the medicines,
where you get a list.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.370 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Right.
Yeah.

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.809 align:middle line:84%
All the--
-Death.

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:29.124 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at goji berry.

00:47:29.124 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Not going to cause death.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It has 5,000 years of history.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:84%
It's time proven.
It's time tested.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.110 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Schizandra berry, remember.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We had-- yeah.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It's 5,000 years of history.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is my
opinion, is that we're

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.400 align:middle line:84%
living in a world
that is getting

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:90%
more and more fear-based.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:90%
There's more and more stress.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:90%
There's alerts.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.990 align:middle line:90%
There's alerts.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:49.697 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're getting them on
our devices from [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:49.697 --> 00:47:50.430 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Constant.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Constant.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get
more and more intense.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so as we get
communicated to,

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
our immune system gets shot
at faster and more frequently

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.190 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day,
or our fear alerts

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.720 align:middle line:90%
are higher during the day.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
balancing that fear out.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So the fear is getting
higher, and there's

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.520 align:middle line:84%
nothing that's helping us
really be resilient to that type

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.700 align:middle line:90%
of immune response.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.420 align:middle line:90%
So this is nature's solution.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Right.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.560 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of your
stress defense shield.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
this stuff is about.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.693 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring this
in, because this one's

00:48:22.693 --> 00:48:23.700 align:middle line:90%
a fun one for me.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.061 align:middle line:84%
This one right here is--
that's like an aphrodisiac.

00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Oh.
-That's cistanche.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And in our community
here in Los Angeles,

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:35.910 align:middle line:84%
cistanche has a very specific
personality and quality.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:38.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
interesting plant.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a parasitical plant
that grows off a tree.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
any chlorophyll in it.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it grows a very
phallic type of growth.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they use that to
make this type of preparation.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And these things work.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.040 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm bringing it in.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people are taking
certain kind of things.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Yes.
Start with x.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and they work.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:58.631 align:middle line:90%
But what are the side effects?

00:48:58.631 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:84%
What are the long
term implications?

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.740 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Right.
Right.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.410 align:middle line:90%
This is time tested.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:02.676 align:middle line:84%
This is thousands
of years of history.

00:49:02.676 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%
So those are drugs.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.801 align:middle line:84%
And these are--
DAVID WOLFE: Natural.

00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Natural.
DAVID WOLFE: Yeah.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.254 align:middle line:90%
So this is called--

00:49:07.254 --> 00:49:08.570 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Cistanche.
-How do you spell that?

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:09.430 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Long
stalk cistanche.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's C, I, S--
DAVID WOLFE: C-I-S-T-A-N-C-H-E.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, cistanche.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And people have cistanche
parties, I'm sure?

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:16.587 align:middle line:90%
I'm just making that up.

00:49:16.587 --> 00:49:17.420 align:middle line:90%
We're just gonna say it.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Cistanche in your pants--
and then you'll remember it.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.810 align:middle line:84%
You see this is in
his medicine bag.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:24.710 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: It's in there.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, for those emergencies.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And what else do
you got in here?

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we've got
in here-- now, I've got,

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.380 align:middle line:90%
boom, digestive enzymes.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, in case you--

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Very key thing to have.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.330 align:middle line:84%
If you go-- sometimes,
I eat at a raw food

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.661 align:middle line:84%
restaurant and it's kind of
not the right combination

00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of things.
I'm like, uh-oh.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.903 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Or you don't know
how long the stuff's been there.

00:49:42.903 --> 00:49:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Antidote.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Antidote.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And the amount that I'll take
isn't just, like, one or two,

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:84%
We're told, oh, just
take one or two.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.970 align:middle line:90%
How about this?

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I might take that one.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.520 align:middle line:84%
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
That happened to
me the other day.

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I was in a movie
theater, and we got

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:00.887 align:middle line:84%
a pizza that was supposed to
be gluten-free, vegan pizza,

00:50:00.887 --> 00:50:02.020 align:middle line:84%
brought it into
the movie theater.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And I get a text.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.545 align:middle line:90%
We gave you the wrong pizza.

00:50:04.545 --> 00:50:05.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm like-- [GASPS]

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely
allergic to wheat.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, no, because
I wasn't really looking at it.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
have helped me.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:14.880 align:middle line:90%
That helps.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
key thing to have.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Two--

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I take these even when I don't
even have food in my stomach.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.570 align:middle line:84%
-Wow.
-Yeah.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning, a lot of
times, if I'm on the road,

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in the morning I'll drink water.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a bunch of my goodies.
And that's it.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have any
calories-- no food.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And I really like that.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.511 align:middle line:84%
So when you take
digestive enzymes,

00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:34.310 align:middle line:84%
if you have a strong stomach--
some people have a very

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:84%
sensitive stomach, can't
take digestive enzymes

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:90%
on an empty stomach.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.334 align:middle line:84%
Some people can.
I can.

00:50:38.334 --> 00:50:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll take eight, 10
on an empty stomach,

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and it absorbs in
your bloodstream

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.244 align:middle line:84%
and just scours everything
like Little Miss Pacman.

00:50:44.244 --> 00:50:45.010 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Interesting.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:45.843 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, cleans things out.

00:50:45.843 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:90%
So are those papaya, pineapple?

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.231 align:middle line:84%
Are there any specific-- what
kind of enzymes are those?

00:50:50.231 --> 00:50:51.570 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds.
This one-- OK.

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So we've got amylase protease.

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:54.310 align:middle line:90%
These are blends.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The protease has five
different types of protease.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.587 align:middle line:84%
And imagine with
the amylase, they're

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:58.420 align:middle line:90%
saying it's a blend here.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It's probably two
or three amlyase.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's
sugar-splitting enzymes

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:90%
and protein-splitting enzymes.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Glucoamylase-- there's another
sugar-splitting enzyme.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.700 align:middle line:84%
There's also invert
in here, which is

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.560 align:middle line:90%
another sugar-splitting enzyme.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.401 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of, you mentioned
something there-- protein.

00:51:12.401 --> 00:51:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get
your protein source?

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Superfoods.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Superfoods-- like this is a
great protein source right

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.177 align:middle line:90%
here, just the reishi spore.

00:51:19.177 --> 00:51:20.809 align:middle line:84%
-Does it have protein in it?
-Yeah.

00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:21.820 align:middle line:90%
It has protein in it.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Bee pollen is an excellent
source of protein.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of protein from
nuts and seeds as well.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I get protein from
chlorella and spirulina

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:90%
and blue green algaes.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: What about amino
acid building proteins?

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:33.835 align:middle line:84%
-Hempseed.
-Hempseed.

00:51:33.835 --> 00:51:34.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Hempseed's.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Great I like, also, sprouts.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.524 align:middle line:84%
Sprouts have good
free form amino acid.

00:51:38.524 --> 00:51:39.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's good for the liver.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very bio
available to the liver.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you get all those amino
acids in their original forms.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So your body can
go, OK, we're going

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:90%
to need that one, that one--

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.679 align:middle line:90%
The building blocks.

00:51:46.679 --> 00:51:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And these three here-- and then
puts it all together for you.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, isn't that interesting?
-Yeah.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:50.529 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I think with
vegetarianism, where

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.430 align:middle line:84%
we are more in the conversation
is, yeah, you need protein,

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:55.470 align:middle line:90%
but it's not that big a deal.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.669 align:middle line:84%
What you really
need, though, is you

00:51:56.669 --> 00:51:57.950 align:middle line:90%
need to get those right oils.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Like you see here,
this is my algae oil.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
I'm getting my DHA.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Omega 3s.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And the EPA.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
vegan fish oil.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:07.700 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Right.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.490 align:middle line:90%
What's its source?

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.290 align:middle line:90%
What's the plant source?

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.091 align:middle line:84%
It's from a red algae.
LISA CARR: Algae.

00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
So that's where it comes from.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.364 align:middle line:84%
All of our fish oil
originally comes from krill.

00:52:15.364 --> 00:52:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Where does a krill get it?

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Krill gets it from algae.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So the algae, the
phytoplankton, are doing

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.300 align:middle line:90%
an incredible magic trick.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They're taking raw sun energy,
and they're fixating carbon,

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're forming long
chain carbon oils that we

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.904 align:middle line:90%
call fish oil from nothing.

00:52:33.904 --> 00:52:34.670 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Interesting.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:35.510 align:middle line:90%
So you're getting D3.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's-- you're
getting the D3, exactly.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You're getting the omega
3 long chain, DHA and EPA.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We've also got in
here DPA, which

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is another long
chained omega 3 that's

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.140 align:middle line:90%
normally present in fish.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got
astaxanthin in here.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So I take one or two
or three of those a day

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.684 align:middle line:84%
with, actually-- this
is a good combination.

00:52:53.684 --> 00:52:55.750 align:middle line:84%
This is some I've mentioned on
your show befora-- MegaHydrate.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:56.390 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Yes.
-Right.

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So we've got
MegaHydrate right there.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazing supplement
for hydration in general,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
hydrogen compound.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what it
is is silica hydride,

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:84%
which is a bucky ball,
globular molecule

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that is saturated with
oleic acid, which is an oil.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And then that oil is
saturated with hydrogen.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:18.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a product that was
developed by my friend

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Patrick Flanagan.
-Right.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Flanagan.
-Yeah.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.870 align:middle line:84%
-Brilliant.
-And he's a genius.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.580 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the great
geniuses of our time.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:25.940 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.710 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, check it out.
-Is it pill form?

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:29.445 align:middle line:84%
-And they're in capsule form.
-Oh, capsule forms.

00:53:29.445 --> 00:53:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, vegetarian caps.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can just pop
those in with oils.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I definitely recommend that
you take those with oils,

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
because it will shield
the oils from being broken

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.530 align:middle line:90%
down prematurely and oxidizing.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:43.497 align:middle line:84%
One of the great problems
with fish oils-- people

00:53:43.497 --> 00:53:45.063 align:middle line:84%
are taking it, and it's
oxidizing in their gut.

00:53:45.063 --> 00:53:46.663 align:middle line:84%
And they're burping it
up, and it's still there.

00:53:46.663 --> 00:53:47.362 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:47.362 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
it with MegaHydrate,

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.340 align:middle line:84%
it shields the oil
from being oxidized.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.391 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
gets to the cells.

00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
you notice if you

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:84%
do it both ways after a while,
you have an instinct that

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.930 align:middle line:90%
tells you, take it with this.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.510 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
Patrick told me himself.

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:84%
He's like, this is
how you should do it.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:03.129 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Yes.
Brilliant scientist.

00:54:03.129 --> 00:54:04.721 align:middle line:84%
It's a good trick
to know about.

00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:05.420 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Yes.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And this the strongest
antioxidant product

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.080 align:middle line:90%
on the market as well.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's a hydrogen source.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:14.513 align:middle line:84%
It shields volatile elements
like the fish oils or

00:54:14.513 --> 00:54:16.350 align:middle line:90%
the algae oils from oxidation.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that,
it's an antioxidant.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.424 align:middle line:90%
And all of this is anti-aging.

00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:22.190 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: All of it.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Explain why, though.
Explain why.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've found
out that there

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.480 align:middle line:84%
are certain chemistries
that are related

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
to protecting us from aging.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.780 align:middle line:84%
One of them is antioxidants
and hydrogen. Hydrogen

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:90%
is our best antioxidant.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The more antioxidants we
have, the more shielded

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:35.850 align:middle line:90%
we are from the atmosphere.

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They it reverse it, reverse
the aging process as well?

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long
time get younger,

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like I'm
getting younger.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:42.474 align:middle line:90%
It's taking a while.

00:54:42.474 --> 00:54:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.520 align:middle line:84%
You said the oxidation
from the atmosphere?

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the atmosphere
that we have on this planet

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.030 align:middle line:90%
is good for us in a certain way.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:51.020 align:middle line:90%
We breathe it and we live on it.

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But is it an ideal
atmosphere for us?

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And the answer appears to be
no, is that it burns us up,

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:84%
is that eventually, we get
burned by the atmosphere.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's called oxidation.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.260 align:middle line:84%
That's free radical damage.
LISA CARR: OK.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The idea, then, is that we
have to counterbalance it

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.000 align:middle line:84%
with antioxidants
so that we don't

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.211 align:middle line:84%
get as oxidized over our years
of breathing this atmosphere.

00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:09.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA CARR: Wow.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.830 align:middle line:84%
What an education that
we've just received.

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is many
different things.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept here
is that you can heal yourself

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.750 align:middle line:84%
through nature, that
you just need to play

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.160 align:middle line:90%
with the right combinations.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
You can look at this
show, watch this show,

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and just freeze frame
it and just take down

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.440 align:middle line:90%
all the stuff that David uses.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go and do
your own exploration.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You really cannot overdose
on any of this stuff.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It's all relatively safe.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.797 align:middle line:90%
And your body will tell you.

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.230 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WOLFE: Your body's
going to tell you.

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:36.110 align:middle line:90%
This is real food.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:38.847 align:middle line:10%
That's the thing about raw
foods, is your body has a stop.

00:55:38.847 --> 00:55:40.280 align:middle line:10%
When you're dealing
with the real raw food,

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.030 align:middle line:10%
your body goes, OK, that's too
much, or that's not enough,

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:10%
or we need more of this.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And one of the reasons why we
like to offer an array of all

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.120 align:middle line:10%
these amazing things
is because you

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.850 align:middle line:10%
never know what you need when.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.170 align:middle line:10%
You might suddenly
be pregnant, and go,

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.440 align:middle line:10%
I need avocado with
spirulina and flaxseed oil.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Your body tells you
exactly what you need.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if you
never had flaxseed

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.401 align:middle line:84%
oil or avocado or spirulina,
you wouldn't know that.

00:56:01.401 --> 00:56:02.133 align:middle line:84%
LISA CARR: Right.
-Right?

00:56:02.133 --> 00:56:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
reach for a toxic mimic

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:06.080 align:middle line:90%
of that, a toxic impostor.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
get back to the base

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.220 align:middle line:90%
formulas, the original stuff.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And then people
go, you know what?

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me try that, try this.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, you
start to know-- like, OK,

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I want that.
I want this.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can tell you that what
I just took-- the last thing,

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I took my body
instantly absorbed

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.950 align:middle line:90%
and said, that-- I need that.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It was the bark.
-Oh, the bark thing.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The bark thing.
It just went--

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Anti-inflammatory.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.535 align:middle line:90%
And David Wolfe is actually 80.

00:56:27.535 --> 00:56:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And this all works for
him to look like he's 40.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, definitely take
this show and replay it.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Watch it again.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Share it with your friends.

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:40.777 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, David.

00:56:40.777 --> 00:56:41.810 align:middle line:90%
DAVID WOLFE: Thank you so much.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:44.181 align:middle line:84%
You are a fountain of youth
and a wealth of information.

00:56:44.181 --> 00:56:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.551 align:middle line:84%
It's been great to be
here with everybody.

00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all.
-So fun.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.401 align:middle line:84%
We finally got to see
into David's medicine bag.

00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:51.980 align:middle line:84%
All right.
Thank you again.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And watch the replay,
share it with your friends,

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:18.434 align:middle line:90%
