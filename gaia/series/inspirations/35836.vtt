00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Research shows that
80% of adults in the US

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:10%
have back and neck
pain at some time.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So if it's you or if it's
someone that you know that just

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
deals with the nagging
pain of a sore back

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
or even more severe
symptoms, today's show

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is like having a brain
body transformational

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:90%
session in your own home.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do some
exercises along with us today.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Anat Baniel is joining
me, she's the creator

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Anat Baniel Method.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:84%
After years of working
with tens of thousands

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of people, along with
her understanding

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of how the brain
changes itself, Anat

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
teaches us ways to access
the brain to overcome

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:90%
pain and limitations.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
be with you, Lisa.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness,
what you've done

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and what you have to give
the world is so incredible.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I want you to stand on that
hill with a giant beacon

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and just tell everybody.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's get
to the root of the problem.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.615 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think so many
people have back and neck

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:90%
pain in the first place?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:10%
It's due to two main
factors, I think.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
One is overuse and the
other one is misuse,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:10%
and I think the second
one is primarily.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
That means we learn
how to move when we're

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
born-- all human beings can
do any voluntary movement--

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and then through a long
process over many years,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to stand, sit,
walk, control our heads,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:10%
And in that process there's
lots and lots of opportunity

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:10%
to actually learn things
that are not optimal,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:10%
so we get habits
that are not optimal

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:10%
and then we stop that
development once very often

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:10%
because we don't attend to it,
people don't understand it,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:10%
and kids already-- by
the age of 6, 7, 8, 9--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:10%
can have pretty poor posture
habits and movement habits

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:10%
that then they carry into life.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And the body's built
to work better,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
so it sort of
fatigues the joints,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
fatigues the [INAUDIBLE], and
creates inflammation and so on.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, which I hope
we get a chance to talk about,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we're built to
keep evolving throughout life,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
including the way we
move, the sophistication

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
of the way we use our body.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So then rather than what
normally people feel and think,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're young and
then you move really well

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.005 align:middle line:84%
and then you're 30 and it's
not as good and then you're 40

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's even worse and then
you're 50 and it's really sad.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The quality of movement,
there is opportunity

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to improve it throughout
life if we know how

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
to access the brain to do that.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's
the main key here,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
is how to access the
brain to change the body.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But let me go back
to your first point

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
about what if we get
in accidents or kids

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
fall off their bike or
they dive to catch a ball.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Do they ever fully
recover from that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or is that where
those little injuries

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and posture changes begin?

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.249 align:middle line:84%
We've all done this.
-Absolutely.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and ideally-- it's
so easy to take care of it.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
When there'll be, I think,
a wider understanding

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
of how these things
work, then it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:90%
can be corrected immediately.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But when, let's
say, a kid dives--

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.871 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a concussion
or anything serious--

00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Right.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
 --but it hurts,
there's a bruise, they

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:90%
can't really use that part.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The brain is so plastic,
that means it changes

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
so quickly that it
re-patterns the movement

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate for-- let's say--
the right shoulder not to move.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is it
becomes a habit in no time,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
so then unconscious
to the child,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
unconscious to the environment
around the child, everything

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
he's learned with that
not moving quite as well.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we sort of circumvent
it, then we grow with a limited

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
shoulder that then shows
up, could show up as pain

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in the shoulder,
neck, lower back,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and be a problem in the
feet, because it's a shift

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in the posture and weight
bearing, and it's-- yes.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
of us did that?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We had banged up knees--
-Everybody.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Everybody.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.935 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you said that
the brain is plastic.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I know plastic
as being hard,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by plastic?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Changeable.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It can change.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:90%
LISA: OK.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So plasticity
means changeability,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and our organs
regenerate themselves

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and change all the time, like
the skin and things like that.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But the system or the
organ in the body that

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
is most subject to change, and
is built to change in response

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to experience, is the brain.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So the brain can
change the most.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And it does all the time.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
The question is, is it going
to change in positive direction

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
or in a negative direction?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
It's either or usually.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you're
here to help direct

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:90%
it into the positive flow.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, how did you
get started in this

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and where did you
learn all this?

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And tell me a little bit
about your background.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm Israeli
born, and when

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I was as young as three years
old, my father was a scientist

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.935 align:middle line:84%
and was introduced to Dr. Moshe
Feldenkrais, who-- those who

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
know his work in
the 20th century,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
he was like the
pioneer of the brain

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:90%
movement, brain plasticity.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have the name then,
but he knew that the brain is

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
a-- well, it's a
fancy set of words,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
but a dynamic highly complex
system that will change.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And people didn't understand
what he was talking about,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but my father met him and
experienced one of his movement

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
lessons and organized
free movement lessons

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in my parent's living
room with a group

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
of his actual researchers.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
just roaming around

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
when he used to come
once a week on Thursdays

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and teach the lesson.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Then when I was about
seven, eight years old,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
my father put me together
to get my dance lessons

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
with a Russian ballerina that
studied in the same group

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
as my father did--
Feldenkrais's movement lessons--

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.461 align:middle line:84%
and she integrated, she had
us little girls do them.

00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I experienced the work,
I was about seven or eight,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget
the very first time.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
vividly until today.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Firs of all, she asked us to
sit down, lean against the wall,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and feel ourselves
and pay attention

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to what we feel in our
bodies, and nobody ever

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:90%
asked me to do that.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
a whole new world

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
just opened up wide
instantaneously.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
doing movements

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of that
lesson I walked home--

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I walked to the bus
station and then home--

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and my body, myself, I
felt completely different,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.430 align:middle line:84%
but not just physically,
also emotionally.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Then we came to the states, we
lived in Berkeley for a while

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and so
when I came back,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't study with
this teacher anymore

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and it all faded
into the background.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward to grad school
and I'm studying to become

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:90%
a clinical psychologist.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I kept doing dance, I danced
my whole life, considered it

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
as a career, but I
forgot about what we

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:90%
call the lessons on the floor.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I want
to work with people

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
more with the feeling of
the body and with movement,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
not just so much through
verbal communication,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
and I started seeking.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And six months into
that, I remembered

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the lessons on the
floor and that's

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.595 align:middle line:84%
when I reconnected
with Feldenkrais--

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
 --and I started
taking private sessions

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
with him and it was remarkable,
and then his group class.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And then a year
and a half into it,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
he opened a training program--
a three-year training program

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.911 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco-- so I took
my little self with a suitcase

00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:90%
and I did it.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, how old
were you at the time?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
ANAT: 22.
-22, my goodness.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Yeah, I started young.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very lucky.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But to have that awareness of
your body at that age is huge.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to look in and
to understand that the body is

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
an alive, beautiful,
working machine,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and to really get in touch
with its beautiful intricacies,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
most don't even take a moment
to do that throughout our day,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and how amazing our bodies are.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Yet you at seven, eight,
had that experience,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
took it on at 22,
and then of course,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
everything you do now you add
it on and changed and applied

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:84%
what you learned and everything,
you've evolved his work

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
into a beautiful thing.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at this video.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:90%
This will just melt your heart.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at Anat's work.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
about my son, Cyprus.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
In July of 2008, after
a traumatic birth,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I met my son who would
become my personal superhero.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Cyprus didn't have a
heartbeat when he was born.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
After two rounds of
resuscitation, he came to life.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:10%
On the sixth day of his life, he
had an MRI showing brain damage

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:10%
in the basal
ganglia and received

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:10%
the prognosis of
highly-probable cerebral palsy.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:10%
I was devastated.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:10%
I had little understanding
of what that meant

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:10%
and how it might
affect our lives.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
We were told to go
home, wait, and watch,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and to see if he
missed milestones.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:10%
We took him home
and just loved him.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:10%
At three months, we were
told he should be doing more

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:10%
and he started traditional
physical therapy.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:10%
For the next six months,
we saw little change.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
When Cyprus was nine
months old, we connected

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.935 align:middle line:90%
with the Anat Baniel Method.

00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Neil Sharp gave him his
first lesson, in which he

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:90%
rolled over for the first time.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.497 align:middle line:90%
I knew we'd found our path.

00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to get
through this without crying,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:90%
but there's no promises.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.965 align:middle line:10%
Shortly after we met with
Anat, she looked me in the eyes

00:10:19.965 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:10%
and recognized my fear, and said
everything is going to be OK,

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:10%
and I knew instinctively
to trust her.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:10%
We let go of traditional therapy
and watched Cyprus progress.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:10%
He started rolling to get
around, then commando crawling,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
and then onto hands and
knees, and at 19 months

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:10%
he was pulling to standing.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
At that time, we were
told by our neurologist

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that in the future we would
be looking for a wheelchair,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
because there was no way
he was ever going to walk.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:10%
The next day, Neil taught
him how to crawl up stairs.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:10%
I remember saying that
going to see the neurologist

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:10%
was like visiting the
office of limitations,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.075 align:middle line:10%
and I would rather come here to
the center for possibilities.

00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.205 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks ago,
Cyprus started walking.

00:11:16.205 --> 00:11:18.935 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.935 --> 00:11:21.833 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.885 align:middle line:10%
I should also mention
he rarely stops talking.

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:10%
I think there's some
footage of Cyprus that's

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:10%
going to be shown, but before,
I want to share my deepest

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:10%
gratitude for the way ABM
has not only impacted my son,

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:10%
but transformed my life
and my family as a whole.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And on behalf of my family
and my fellow classmates,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank you
for your life's work,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:10%
and for writing "Kids
Beyond Limits," which

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:10%
will further push this
very important work out

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:10%
into the world.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:10%
I look forward to the
Anat Baniel Method

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.784 align:middle line:10%
being the standard of
care, and I love you.

00:12:07.784 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how did you get
in touch with the family?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
How did you meet
that particular--

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%
how did they reach you?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was actually
my colleague, Dr. Neil

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.445 align:middle line:84%
Sharp, that was
introduced to them

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and they were introduced to him.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
another parent

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that brought their child to
us, and that's how it started.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what an incredible story.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want you
to-- if you could--

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
talk to us a little
bit about Cyprus

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and how he looked when you met.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have a video here
that we're going-- just

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
tell us a little bit about.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to roll this
video and talk over this here.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is Cyprus.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:10%
Our fun little guy, Cyprus,
and 2008 was when he was born?

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:10%
ANAT: Yes, he was born 2008,
and as the mother mentioned

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:10%
in the video, he was
born without a heartbeat

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and they had resuscitated twice.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:10%
So here you see him in
the ICU, and here you

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:10%
see him a little older.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:10%
And when you watch,
she tries to feed him

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:10%
and he can't even hold his
head up for any length of time.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:10%
And he reacts, his
brain can't handle

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:10%
any stimulation to the mouth,
so he has this jerky movement.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Here it's a little bit
later and he already rolls.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:10%
And see, his head still--
the first time he rolled,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:10%
he couldn't quite hold it
up, but I had the mother

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:10%
kiss him so that when
he lifts up the head,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.366 align:middle line:10%
something good happens.
LISA: Yes.

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:10%
ANAT: And the brain picks
it up really quickly,

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:10%
so you'll see the next
time he rolls, he'll

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:10%
pick up the head much higher.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And now here, you see here
it's a few months later

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:10%
and it's in a training class,
and she brought him for one

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:10%
of the trainees to work on.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:10%
And I am teaching the trainee
to go gentler and slower.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:10%
We'll talk about that later,
why that's so powerful.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Here he's at home,
it's a home video,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:10%
and he's seeing the
lens of the camera

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:10%
so it's interesting for him.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
You see now-- he couldn't
move at all when I saw him

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.334 align:middle line:84%
the first time, he
was like a tight ball

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't do anything.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:10%
And look, he tries to touch
it but he can't quite control,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:10%
and I love this sequence because
he figures it out himself

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:10%
and now his brain
figured out how

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:10%
to put the thumb on the lens.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:10%
This is Neil, and he's really
trying to reach the toy

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:10%
and Neil brings it a little bit
closer, and then he helps him.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:10%
He does different things to
help his brain recognize that he

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:10%
could use his back-- which
he couldn't quite well,

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:10%
but look how well he is here.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do
a movement lesson

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:10%
that will show people how to
use their lower back better.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:10%
And how happy he is.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:10%
You see, and he's so used to it.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:10%
And children with this
condition, very often

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:10%
their heels are off the
floor because the muscles

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:10%
are very tight, and look how
beautifully he's organized.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm pointing out to it.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And here it's very
important because I'm

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:10%
getting his attention.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
First, he wants to
get it, you see,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and he will just being fast,
so I took the ball away

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm slowing down.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:10%
And now he figured it out and
look how deliriously happy

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:10%
he becomes.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:10%
And this happens really fast
but the changes are immediate.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:10%
This is my favorite
sequence in this video

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:10%
because he's trying to-- Neil
is doing a brilliant thing,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:10%
which he's doing nothing.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And he lets Cyprus
figure it out--

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
he even gets himself
out of the picture--

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and look how he's
problem solving.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:90%
This is not so simple.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Look at the size of
the child, the size

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of the walker, the
narrow path when there's

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:90%
this door thing at the bottom.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And you see his
hands actually get

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
to hold it better and better.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:10%
So as he's trying to figure out
how to get this thing out-- you

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:10%
see, we don't help him--
and now he gets it out.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:10%
And this is huge, and the amount
of learning, the reasoning--

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:10%
Here it's actually in a
studio where do they interview

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:10%
the parents for
some TV something,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:10%
and he sees himself
on the monitor.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So he goes and he
says two Cypruses.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:10%
And he goes over, and you see
he goes from crawling-- he just

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:10%
started walking independently
a few days earlier--

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and he asks to jump.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:10%
So he's jumping and then look--
very slowly, very gradually,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:10%
he gauges himself and figures
out how to walk forward.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
This is two weeks that
he's been walking.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's already 3
and 1/2 years old.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Usually kids at this
age don't start walking.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Oh my goodness,
that is amazing.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
happens because you

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
did a positive
reinforcement with movement

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and the
body, and connected them.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's more than
positive reinforcement,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because there wasn't much
positive to reinforce.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But when something positive
happens, we amplify it.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's providing enormous amount
of new information to the brain

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:90%
starting where the child is.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So we don't ask people
to do what they can't do,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
because my motto's become
if he could, he would.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:90%
If she could, she would.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
People can only do
what they do right now.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
But if we start
where they are now

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.731 align:middle line:84%
and we start just
playing with it--

00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yes.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
 --and moving it
around, it grows.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
something else grows,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and from that
something else grows,

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the brain,
body, mind, self develops.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And this works, of course,
with adults as well.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, very well.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if somebody has had a
condition for 20, 30, 50 years,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you can start to
restore mobility?

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy you're
asking this question.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely yes, at
any age, and there's

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
gorgeous research on rats
that shows that before they're

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
getting close to dying,
they start getting

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
some-- basically brain
training, but it's

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:90%
not like movement training.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's getting the
brain to wake up

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:90%
and start doing its job better.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And within four weeks, they
get their physical strength,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
their cognitive ability
to problem solve mazes

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of stuff,
and their life span--

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:90%
on the average-- increases 40%.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And is it because they just
have a higher quality of life

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and they want to live longer?

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.033 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I can't tell
you about rat experience,

00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you that vitality
is intimately associated

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
with the vibrancy of the
brain and its ability

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to problem solve and move in the
direction of more connections

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.865 align:middle line:84%
and more complexity, rather than
loss of connection and rigidity

00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and that generation.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was instantly
applying that to adults.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't so much
think about the rats.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about how
we as adults can actually

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
get into this free
movement, something that

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
unlocks our body a little bit.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'd mentioned that we're
going to do some exercises, so

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:90%
try this along at home.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you can put
your things on the side

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
so you can move.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you take your shoes off,
and I suggest for the people

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
in the audience that
are watching this--

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And why is the reason
for the shoes off?

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all, it gives
you contact with the ground.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And we evolved or
were formed to have

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
contact with the
ground, and high heels

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:90%
is a later invention.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that requires a brain
that can handle it,

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the ideal.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we want to do change,
I want also the contact

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
from your feet to connect
to the changes that happen

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
in your hips and your lower
back and in your head,

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
so it becomes one picture.
LISA: OK.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can move the shoes a
little bit more so you can

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
spread your feet a little bit--
-Sure.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
 --and your knees,
and you bring

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
your tush to the front of the
chair so you're free to move.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to work
on that is very important

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and a very central
movement to everybody

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
every day is turning your head.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple movement,
and one of the things

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that we see when people get
injured and/or when they age,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:90%
the neck gets stiff, right?

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And it gets harder and harder to
turn the head, harder to drive,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and when people get old, it's
actually dangerous for them

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
very often to cross the street
because they can't gauge

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:90%
what's happening around them.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
So very, very important.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do
some ground rules,

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:90%
for you and for everybody.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
very, very slowly, we're

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
going to move small
movements, and we're

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:90%
going to move very gently.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.551 align:middle line:84%
Now there's an intentionality
behind the slow movement,

00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And the gentle, and we'll
talk about that afterwards.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you and
people can experience

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:90%
the impact of that first?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
guide you, but I'm

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
going to ask you to just-- the
main thing is not to perform

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
a movement, a big
movement-- you're going

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to follow my
instructions, but it's

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:90%
to feel yourself as you move.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
It's about connecting to what
you feel as you move, OK?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
That's very, very powerful and
important for brain change.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.555 align:middle line:84%
Like you did when
you were seven

00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:90%
or eight-year-old little girl.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
ask you to lean on

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
your left hand behind--
no before you lean,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
before you lean even, sorry.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Just turn your head gently to
look to one side and the other,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and just see without straining
the neck, turn the other way

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and see how far you turn
if you don't try hard, OK?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And now do it one more time,
so you can see what you see

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:90%
and then the other way.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- in my
world-- called fast.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.141 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
do it one more time

00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
move your head slowly.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to show you.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like I have time.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning my head,
but it gives me

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
a chance to feel if
the movement is soft

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or if the movement is
like that or whatever.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:90%
LISA: OK.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to go slow.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not used to that but
you're going to go slow.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:90%
That's excellent.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And now you can feel
where it jumps, you see?

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not completely smooth.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter,
it can get smooth.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that normal?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very common.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Very, very common.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It jumps, what do you mean?

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not organized
to move smoothly

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and the areas that it jumps, it
means there's some discomfort

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
opportunity to get better.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:84%
You see, I like those
things because it opens

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
up the door for improvement.
LISA: Uh-huh.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Now lean on your
left hand behind you.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do my right--
-OK

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
On your left hand behind you
like that, that's excellent.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.031 align:middle line:84%
You took some weight
off from your back.

00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to take this hand

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.727 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to put your
chin on the back of your hand,

00:22:16.727 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and then you're actually going
to lean on it a little bit.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
be a little slouchy.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA: OK.
-OK, excellent.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:90%
LISA: It feels good.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going to
move your head and your arm

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and your shoulder, everything
together, to look to your left.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to your left, right?

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And then back.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.186 align:middle line:84%
You're doing
excellent, just drop it

00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:90%
so it hangs a little more.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but you lean on it.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.011 align:middle line:84%
And do it again and as you do
it slowly-- begin doing it.

00:22:49.011 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
-To the left?
-Yeah, but see what moves else.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel the ribs
moving a little bit,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
the spine moving a little bit?

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And come back.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to actually
touch you in a minute somewhere

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.321 align:middle line:84%
where there isn't
much movement yet.

00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
OK.
ANAT: OK?

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:90%
So go very slow so I can do it.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And notice that you do the
movement but you're pelvis

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much inert.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Right, it's not moving at all.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and most people are
like that in the beginning.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So now we are going to do
something a little different.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
rest for one second

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and bring both hands in
front, and just sit and see

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
whether those three movements--
don't even look at me,

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:84%
just go internal for a moment--
and feel if those three

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:84%
movements-- as
little as they are

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and as imperfect as
you did them-- still

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you sit a little
differently, maybe

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:90%
a little lighter or whatnot.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel a
difference between one

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:90%
shoulder and the other.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
My right shoulder
feels higher, actually.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.814 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Yes, OK, whatever.

00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But just feel the difference.
-It's different.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Yeah.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, lean on the left
hand behind you again.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Lean on the back
of the hand again.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going to turn
yourself like this to the left

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
as far as is comfortable and
you're going to stay there.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
As far as comfortable but don't
move the head without the arm,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and stay there.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And now in this position, only
your eyes, move them right

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and left very gently so you
don't give yourself a headache.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Right and left.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Very gentle.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Very, very gentle.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And now keep the arm and
hand and shoulder where they

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.933 align:middle line:84%
are, but just to
head, turn it so it

00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%
would leave the hand, right?

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Turn it to the left
a little bit more.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and then
turn it to the right.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And the eyes stay--

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.175 align:middle line:84%
They go wherever
they want right now.

00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Wherever you want.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:90%
That's right, you took a breath.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, take the head and the
eyes in opposite directions.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think,
slowly, that's right.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:90%
You're doing excellent.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then take the
head and the eyes

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite directions.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:84%
This is great for eye
movement exercises, because we

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:90%
stare computers all day--

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And now come back to the
middle, lean on the hand,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
back of the hand
like you did before.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And now go ahead and turn
to your left, everything

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:90%
together again.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
-With [INAUDIBLE]?
-Yeah.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.341 align:middle line:84%
And feel if it got
a little easier.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And you see this part has
started moving now, yeah.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Now your ribs have
started moving--

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Just by doing
the eye exercises?

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because it's
mitigated through the brain.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And now rest, just
rest, put both hands

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and sit and just feel now.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.571 align:middle line:84%
You see, you're
sitting taller, easier.

00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel?
LISA: Yes.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You popped upright more.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Warmer, yes.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.904 align:middle line:84%
You see, you don't have
to-- you just popped up.

00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
LISA: I have actually more
energy, more alertness.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, that's what happens.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do either
one or two more variations.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to do
something, the next step.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So lean on the hand behind you,
and see now you lean better,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:84%
you feel your spine knows where
to go to transfer the weight.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You see, the
intelligence wakes up.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Lean on the back of the hand,
twist easily as far as you go,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and now what you're going
to do is you're going to put

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
this hand also on your chair.
-OK.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:84%
ANAT: So you're leaning now
on both hands, that's right.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'm
going to ask you to do

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:84%
is to pick up the right side
of your tush and put it down.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%
So my right hip and then down.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
The right hip and down.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And feel very slowly how
that makes you taller.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
You see, it pushes the
top of the head taller.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And now every time you do
this, also turn the shoulders

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and head to the left.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.451 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do it again
at the same time.

00:26:30.451 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
have to go much slower.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
To the left, OK.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're going
to go much slower

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
so you can coordinate it.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So both shoulders turn
and the head, and the hip

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:84%
comes, and then you come
back to where you were.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It feels great. on the spine.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, of course,
because it integrates it

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:90%
into the movement.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Before about 50% of the
spine wasn't participating.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to do
something a little funny,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so you'll have to slow down,
stay there, lean on your hands.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
lift the hip again

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
turn your shoulders

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and head to the right.
-OK.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
-So it'll feel contradictory.
-This way, OK.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's it.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And feel if you can soften
the chestbone, the ribs,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:90%
that it will allow you to go.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
See, most people are not
aware of their sternum at all.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.731 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's dead
to them, there you go.

00:27:18.731 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.811 align:middle line:84%
You feel how the
hip got softer?

00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And now twist again to the
left, everything to the left.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
To the left and look
where you're going.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh wow, I can see all
the way behind me now.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, and rest for a second.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You see now how your pelvis
moves, it comes to life.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.155 align:middle line:84%
LISA: It's interesting, we're
not aware of our sternum bone

00:27:38.155 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
at all.
-All all.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.233 align:middle line:90%
That's what houses our heart.

00:27:41.233 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and it stiffens the
whole chest, which immobilizes

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
the chest, which lowers
your energy and makes

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:84%
people feel a little
depressed and all that stuff.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Now lean on your
left hand behind you.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Put the arm under your chin,
twist yourself and use your hip

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and turn around with the hip,
with everything, there you go.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Oh, my hip just popped.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.101 align:middle line:84%
But pressing on the foot, now
you know why you're barefoot.

00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Yep.
-You see?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's from the bottom
throughout your whole self.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, are you doing this at home?

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, one more
thing we're going to do

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is as you do it,
push you belly out

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
instead of pulling the belly
in, which many people do.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Push the belly out, out, out.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:90%
You see how tall you got?

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It allows the spine to get tall.
-Yeah.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Try it again.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Push the belly out.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:90%
How about that, girl?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
And rest.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that at all.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Try it one time.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Lean on your left hand,
put your chin on this,

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.660 align:middle line:84%
pull your belly in
and hold it tight.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
No, pull your bell
in and hold it tight

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.866 align:middle line:84%
and keep it like that--
-OK.

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:90%
 --and try to turn.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.131 align:middle line:84%
Keep it like that, then try
to turn and see what happens.

00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Terrible.
-Yeah.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You feel?
And now do the other way.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Push the belly out,
twist around and do it.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Which person would
you rather be?

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And now rest and just feel--
I can see it in your face,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the right side of your
face looks completely

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
different than the left.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:90%
The tone is--

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.487 align:middle line:84%
You are trained to see
these things, that's amazing.

00:29:12.487 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you close
your eyes and feel it.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself throughout
your whole right

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
side, including the
bottom of your foot

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:90%
and your whole left side.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel any different?

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:84%
That's it, and now your
diaphragm just let go.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Wow, you're trained so
well to look exactly

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
at the nuances of the body.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:10%
It's beautiful.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Things that I'm doing
that I don't even notice.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:10%
ANAT: Exactly, and
that's a big part

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:10%
of the work is that you become
a quick and connected and loving

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:10%
observer of yourself.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:10%
You see, not in order to
judge-- oh, my belly's this,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.854 align:middle line:10%
or my back is that, or I'm
stiff here-- but it's going,

00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:49.720 align:middle line:10%
oh, that's what I'm doing.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.760 align:middle line:90%
What'll happen if I do that?

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And bang, bang, bang,
people just pop up.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:84%
LISA: These are things
you can do at your desk,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
you can do anywhere.
ANAT: Yes.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.555 align:middle line:84%
Park the car and
do this in your car.

00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:84%
ANAT: Yeah, you can even
do it while you drive

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.701 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, as long
as you stay awake

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
to what happens around you.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.291 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get more
alert, actually.

00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, really, there's
a whole question of the base

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:84%
level of alertness of the brain,
and when people get ill or they

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.021 align:middle line:84%
get older, they
start-- literally--

00:30:19.021 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
it's not really that there are
lights in the brain, but they

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:90%
start really dimming down--

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA: I want to do all my
interviews like this now,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
this would be great.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Yes.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Fully connected and
alert, this is great.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:90%
I can see it in your eyes.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are much more--
it's a level of awakefulness,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.301 align:middle line:84%
it's a base awakefulness from
which you operate your life.

00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yes.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
life, that's

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:90%
what the [INAUDIBLE] like.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, does my mobility
and my neck get--

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now sit just in the middle
and turn your head to the left

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:90%
and use everything you learned.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You see, use what you learned
and feel what it's like.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Wow, I can see--

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And feel the smoothness
of the movement.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And now don't force it,
but move to the right.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a little better
but nothing like it.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:90%
You feel?

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Now that's great, because
beforehand I could only

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.327 align:middle line:84%
see here, and now I can
see all the way behind me

00:31:07.327 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and all the way behind
the other direction.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Yes.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely awesome.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I hope you tried that at
home, and you can always

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
watch the replay, too, because
that's so freeing and-- did

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:90%
oxygen get to my brain?

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.700 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Feels like it.
-Yes.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, first of
all, you breathe better.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, you
freed the diaphragm.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But all the systems are
interconnected so they just

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:90%
work better, the absorption.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was in the hospital
with pretty severe pneumonia

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and she really had a
hard time breathing,

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
she was on an oxygen supply
machine kind of thing.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would do two,
three minutes with her

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
want to tire her,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:84%
because she needed all
her energy for healing.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And she knows my work, so
she just would sit and lean

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and I just worked directly
on her back a little bit,

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and because she was tied, her
oxygen absorption would go

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
from pretty low, pretty scary--
-Oh, interesting.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
 --to close to 100.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Then because of the
illness, it would go back,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:90%
and then I'd work on her again--

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing way of
being able to measure it.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh no, I've worked with
people after a stroke and stuff

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can see-- and
these are involuntary parts

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:84%
of the system, but they're
interconnected to movement

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and organization of the brain.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll take a look at
one of Anat's classes

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and one of the students
in her classes.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I came into this thinking that
maybe it would help me manage

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the pain for the rest of my
life, and I'm leaving here--

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it's like a miracle to me, like
I know it's possible for me

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to rejuvenate and revitalize
myself and my whole life.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that the
secret to your vital self

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:90%
lies in how your brain works?

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
What your brain tends to do
if you just live your life

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:84%
normally is to get more
and more into a rut

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:90%
where you run on autopilot.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
What I've discovered working
with thousands of adults

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and children is that the moment
we wake up our brain to resume

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:84%
creating new connections,
we are flooded

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:90%
with energy and well-being.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We move more freely
and we have less pain.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:10%
So I'm here and I am feeling
so much life and vitality

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:10%
in my body that I am
just-- and I have no idea.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The door is so wide
open about what

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.510 align:middle line:90%
this work will do through me.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm a little
kid in a candy store.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You might have noticed that as
habits get more and more deeply

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
ingrained over the years, we
lose flexibility and strength

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:90%
in our body and in our minds.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
We lose our power, creativity,
we never jump anymore,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:90%
and we lose vitality.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The Anat Baniel Method will give
you access to your own brain

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and help you wake it up to form
new patterns and possibilities

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
for you, helping you
fulfill on your dreams

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.240 align:middle line:90%
while enjoying your daily life.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Been in bed for
3 and 1/2 years,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:10%
and I started windsurfing
again this year religiously.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.090 align:middle line:10%
And I incorporate my moves
into the windsurfing,

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:10%
and it's easier and I go
faster every time I do less.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:90%
So I beat the boys on the water.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
With the Anat Baniel Method,
you will immediately start

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:90%
reversing the aging process.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Movement becomes more
fluid, you will experience

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:10%
greater stamina, and
your thinking will

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:10%
become more clear and creative.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:10%
In other words, you will
start feeling youthful

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:10%
and you will be
more youthful again.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:84%
When were you diagnosed
with Parkinson's?

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Two years ago.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, and look at her.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're
diagnosed, you've

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:90%
had it for a while, right?

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and look.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:24.363 align:middle line:84%
So Kay, run back to your place,
and the camera follow Kay.

00:35:24.363 --> 00:35:26.768 align:middle line:90%

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to
experience our vitality

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and anti-aging movement
programs through the DVDs,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
our workshops, private sessions
with our practitioners,

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.920 align:middle line:84%
or professional
training programs.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And make sure you
check our innovative

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:84%
online interactive movement
program called Desk Trainer.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Get ready for a vibrant,
pain-free, and energy-filled

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:90%
life

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:84%
That is an amazing
example of how

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
your work helps all sorts of
people from all walks of life.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
What about people who've
had multiple surgeries

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:84%
or are heading into more
surgeries after one had failed?

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Can you help people who
have been through surgeries?

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because when you
have a surgery-- injury that

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
led to surgery or a surgery by
itself-- from the point of view

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:84%
of the body and the brain,
even though it's necessary

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're well-meaning, it's
a form of an injury, right?

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yeah, true.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.620 align:middle line:84%
You open, you break,
you cut, you sew.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is big deal.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And we need to relearn
how to move ourselves.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And very often, people who
have back pain or other kinds

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of pain, the pain
developed over the years

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
due to the way that
they were moving

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of pressures
that we're consistently--

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
LISA: They got locked in.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And certain pressures
in certain joints

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that created the trouble.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So you want to learn to
move-- even if the surgery's

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
successful, you want
to move differently

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
to drive yourself

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to where you were before.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can get to
a quicker healing

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
through movement, even though
the surgeon or somewhere

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
in your procedure they would
say, don't do this exercise,

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:90%
don't do exercise.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that more
and more, people

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:28.700 align:middle line:84%
understand that after surgery--
as soon as possible to get

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:90%
people moving.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that people had
to lie down for a week or two

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and that was a disaster, because
then the brain really loses

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:84%
connection and patterns
and it's not a good thing,

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and people get very weak.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So everybody tries to
get people on their feet

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:84%
as fast as possible today.
LISA: OK.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe so, that
it's a general thing,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:90%
so that's excellent.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:84%
The question is what do you
do, what kind of movement

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:52.550 align:middle line:84%
do you do?
LISA: Right.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would start
with movement, actually

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%
with the people lying
down so that there

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is no demand of the
pull of gravity,

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and people are not
scared, because people

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:90%
learn their experience.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you put somebody
on their feet too soon--

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:84%
either they had a stroke
or a surgery or something

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
like that-- they
will do something,

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:84%
but that something is
usually very disorganized,

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and that is what's learned.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I call it learning
your own limitations.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So instead of doing that, I
start getting people to move

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting the brain to
reconnect to different parts

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
of the body, and do all kinds of
dynamic relationships before I

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.760 align:middle line:84%
make the full demand
of carrying your weight

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
or doing it stronger
and all that stuff.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And yes, hundreds, thousands--
not hundreds of thousands,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but thousands of people--
that have gone from inability

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to really freedom of movement,
or what I call moving

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:90%
people from the no to the yes.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Yeah, beautiful,
the no to the yes.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, well take a
look at this next video,

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can do this
exercise with us as well.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.991 align:middle line:84%
Anat's going to take you
through a standing exercise.

00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Please get up, stand up,
turn 30 degrees to your left.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Spread your feet comfortably and
bend your knees a little bit.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And now-- carefully
on your head,

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:84%
not to hit it-- bend down with
your hands towards your toes

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
as if you want to touch your
toes, but do not stretch.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And just see how far you
go without trying hard

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And now turn to face the back
of the chair in front of you.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Lean on your hands on
the back of the chair,

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and now round your
back, round your spine,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
pull your belly in,
and lower your head

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and eyes to look towards
your belly button.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And then arch your back,
push the belly out,

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and look up with your
head towards the ceiling.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And now round your back,
pull your belly in, and look

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.870 align:middle line:90%
towards your belly button.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And then arch your
back, free your abdomen,

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and look up with your eyes.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And now stand up, turn 30
degrees towards your left,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.560 align:middle line:84%
bend your knees a
little bit, and go down

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
with your hand towards the
floor and see if it's become

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.750 align:middle line:90%
a little easier to go down.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And come back up, turn
towards the chair,

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.520 align:middle line:84%
lean on the back of the chair in
front if you, spread your legs,

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.690 align:middle line:90%
bend the knees a little bit.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And now pull the belly in and
look under your left armpit.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Turn your head to peak
under your left armpit

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and then arch your back and
look over your left shoulder.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Show your tail, free the belly,
and now pull your belly in

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and look under your
right armpit and then

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
look over your right
shoulder, at your right tush.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And now again, look under your
left armpit, round your back,

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
pull your belly in, and then
look over your left shoulder.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And now stand up, stand up,
turn 30 degrees to your left,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:84%
bend your knees, spread
your feet, and go down

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and see if it's become
even easier to go down

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and if you're
going even further.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And stand up and sit down.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now when people have
done that exercise in the past,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
you said that in the beginning,
their pelvis barely moved.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, check this out with you.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Did your pelvis move in
this particular exercise

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.170 align:middle line:90%
we just saw?

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Why do people have
so much stiffness

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
in that lower back pelvis area?

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's probably for
a variety of reasons,

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but I think primarily
when they're

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
young, when they're kids sitting
for many, many hours in school.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety gets us to pull our
belly in and hold our breath

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and immobilize the
chest, which immobilizes

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.750 align:middle line:90%
the lower back and the pelvis.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
a little bit older,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
the ideal of a flat stomach
and pulling the belly in

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and believing that that
provides the power for the body

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and the movement,
which is actually,

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.945 align:middle line:90%
I believe, a myth and a mistake.

00:42:26.945 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the brain
just has not-- or lost,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.200 align:middle line:84%
if they had it as babies
and young children--

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.820 align:middle line:84%
just has lost the ability to
control that part because it's

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:90%
not mapped in the brain.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.035 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're told
to have a tight core

00:42:43.035 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and that the core supports the
lower back or the backbone.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the short answer.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all, to say that
something supports something

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.681 align:middle line:84%
is a mechanical model
of a stationary item.

00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if we were like a
big statue in a garden--

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:90%
That would makes sense.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It would make sense,
because you want

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to put something in front
of it, so if there's

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:90%
wind it doesn't topple over.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But the way we keep our
balance is through movement,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't keep our balance
by immobilizing ourselves.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wrong idea, how
to try to get stronger.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Now it is absolutely true
that the most powerful muscles

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
in the body are connected to the
pelvis, but the most powerful

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:90%
of those are the glutes.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And the lower back muscles
and the abdomen muscles

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.350 align:middle line:84%
can be very powerful,
but their short-term work

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:90%
muscles, they're not long-term.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And their direction is to
fold the body, to jump,

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
we have to use the back muscles.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, the front
muscles have to let go,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
because that's how the
brain works, it alternates.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It's called antagonistic, I
don't like it because I don't

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.710 align:middle line:84%
think they're in a war,
but it has to synchronize

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:90%
as if controlled by the brain.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So in acute mental
illnesses like catatonia,

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:84%
the brain contracts the
flexors and the extensors

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, and
you know what it does?

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:84%
It makes people to be catatonic,
that means they can't move.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
move-- that's what

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I did with you earlier
and that's what happened

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.170 align:middle line:90%
in the standing lesson.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why people get to
go down so much faster.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And their hamstrings are
not short anymore-- or less

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
short-- in seconds because
by arching the back

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and freeing the belly,
pushing the belly out,

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:90%
the brain gets the point.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And it says, oh, I can
do that, so to speak.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you just go
down, it's within seconds.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.740 align:middle line:90%
It's very dramatic, the change.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
ANAT: Yes, it's
instantaneous, practically.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I love how you show
really how everybody

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:90%
can do these exercises.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at another
video of one of Anat's classes.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been in a lot of pain
for the last two weeks,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and they said that my hip
may be-- it was the thing I

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to hear--
that they think

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing cartilage in my hip.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And every step would hurt,
and after the first day

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have pain anymore.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's really,
really delightful.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Pain can be caused by
injuries, surgeries,

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and other medical
conditions, but

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
most often, pain
comes from the way

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:90%
we've been using our bodies.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The way that our brain has
figured out how to move us,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.820 align:middle line:84%
like the way we stand, how
we walk, and the movements we

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:90%
do every day.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.960 align:middle line:84%
My name is Joel,
I'm 71 years old,

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and over the past several
years I've developed

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.140 align:middle line:90%
a number of walking issues.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, in four
relatively short lessons,

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.895 align:middle line:84%
I feel like an
absolutely new person.

00:45:54.895 --> 00:45:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I have fluidity in my knees,
I have fluidity in my hips,

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.580 align:middle line:90%
my walking is a lot better.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I came with chronic foot pain,
I don't have foot pain anymore.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say is
that it's quite amazing.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Habitual, rigid, limited, and
compulsive patterns of movement

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:84%
often are the cause of
the pain we experience.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Through the nine essentials
of the Anat Baniel Method--

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and through very safe, gentle,
and fun moments lessons--

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.870 align:middle line:84%
you will wake up your
brain and you will flood it

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:84%
with new information that
gets it out of its rut

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to discover new alternatives and
pain-free ways for you to move.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I had pretty severe
back pain coming in,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I was unable to walk upright.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't able to sit on the
floor listening to the lectures

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.520 align:middle line:90%
for quite a while.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And through this work, I've
been able to figure out

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:84%
how to move in my body
to alleviate that pain.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I still play golf and
I still mountain bike.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
A healthy body is a body
that moves in a fluid way,

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:84%
with the brain
re-calibrating information

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:90%
on an ongoing basis.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the body is
an integrated system,

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:84%
it is difficult to fix, for
example, lower back pain

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:84%
by simply focusing
on the lower back.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.120 align:middle line:84%
With the Anat Baniel
Method, you will

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:25.250 align:middle line:84%
get to move not only your
whole body, but also your mind

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in many different and new ways.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Your pain will diminish and
oftentimes simply disappear.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
In the process, you will become
more flexible and stronger,

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.860 align:middle line:84%
your breathing and
posture will improve,

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and you will experience an
increasing level of creativity,

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.930 align:middle line:90%
clarity, and self-awareness.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:48.890 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no pain, I
can move it back, forward,

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:90%
up, down.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I have two tears
in my rotator cuff.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been to two
different doctors, two

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.940 align:middle line:84%
different physical therapists,
and I'm going on next Tuesday,

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to be shocked
because she's going to say,

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.560 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh, what happened?

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.180 align:middle line:10%
Because she just won't
be able to believe it,

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:10%
because they measure
you and stuff, so--

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:15.090 align:middle line:10%


00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Whether you do our
pain-free movement programs

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.640 align:middle line:10%
through the DVDs,
through our workshops,

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.650 align:middle line:10%
through private sessions,
or through our professional

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:30.540 align:middle line:10%
training programs, or also
through our online interactive

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:10%
movement program
called Desk Trainer,

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:10%
the changes you
will see and feel

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.020 align:middle line:10%
are going to be staggering.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Get ready for a whole new you.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now how can fitness--
and this type of movement,

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I should say-- help with
slowing down the aging process

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:90%
or adding longevity to life?

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.517 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:49:00.517 --> 00:49:01.450 align:middle line:90%
What's the connection there?

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the connection is that
this way of doing the movement

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:84%
with essentials-- which are
the principles through which

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the brain wakes up,
which is what children

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.521 align:middle line:84%
do-- so first of all, it's
movement with attention.

00:49:14.521 --> 00:49:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We did that.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.425 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention to what
you feeling as you move.

00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:90%
That becomes your focus.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Then you slow down,
because fast you can only

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.340 align:middle line:84%
do what you already know,
that's how the brain works

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:90%
and the patterns work.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
create something new,

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:30.860 align:middle line:84%
you have got to slow down,
and it's very, very powerful.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then reducing
the force because it

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.360 align:middle line:90%
increases the sensitivity.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
You can feel more
what's happening,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling of what happens
is what wakes up the brain

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and gets it to create
new connections.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then variations,
you get playful,

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.880 align:middle line:84%
you make intentional
mistakes, you

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.580 align:middle line:90%
get very loose about the goals.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.964 align:middle line:90%
You don't drive for a goal.

00:49:48.964 --> 00:49:50.130 align:middle line:84%
You know you're
going to get there,

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.940 align:middle line:90%
but you're doing it that way.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Enthusiasm, you amplify
positive changes.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You use imagination,
you use awareness,

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:01.850 align:middle line:84%
all those are some
of the essentials.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The brain literally
creates new connections,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and the estimate is 1.8
million new connections

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.840 align:middle line:84%
per second when you apply
the movement with intention.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And that process of
differentiation in the brain

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and then integration
into new possibilities--

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:84%
literal new possibilities--
is the process of life,

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.230 align:middle line:90%
and that's what children do.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're the most vibrant,
then they move all the time.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.330 align:middle line:84%
What happens with this work
is you can always start

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:31.940 align:middle line:90%
with it wherever the person is.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's even in
bed, not able to get up,

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:84%
they can still move their
tongue or their fingers.

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's somewhere that
you can access the brain

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and wake it up.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The brain wakes up
because of the way

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.315 align:middle line:84%
you do the process, not because
of the content of the process.

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:84%
-What about eyes?
-Huge.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.650 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why I use it, because
a third of the cortex

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.720 align:middle line:90%
is visual cortex.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It's very connected to
many, many different systems

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.900 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And we usually move the
eyes together with the head,

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and actually with the
shoulders and everything.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:84%
People get older and
then everything gets

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.249 align:middle line:84%
more and more glued together.
LISA: Yeah.

00:51:07.249 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
When you move the eyes in
opposite directions to the head

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.280 align:middle line:84%
or in opposite
direction, you create

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.130 align:middle line:84%
a massive differentiation
in the brain.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.610 align:middle line:90%
You have no choice but to do.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come back
to do the original movement,

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.690 align:middle line:84%
the brain is already
organizing it better because it

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.600 align:middle line:90%
has all this new information.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The brain is an
information system.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It has all this new
information to work with.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually
improve your eyesight

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:84%
or help with that degeneration,
after 40 eyesight thing?

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, depends what the
generation is due to.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It can be different metabolic
stuff and so-and-so.

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I can't make a general
statement like that,

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
but I can certainly tell
you that my eyesight

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.070 align:middle line:84%
got a whole lot better
from doing this work.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, when I
don't do it for a while--

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and I get tired and travel
or dehydrated-- my eyesight

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:90%
is not as good.

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The eyesight, we tend to
think of it like we are 20/20

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
or blah blah blah, whatever
numbers, but it's also dynamic.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything about us is dynamic.

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And what movement with attention
and all the other essentials

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
do is it gets us
into motion literally

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.720 align:middle line:84%
in the physical sense,
cognitive, emotional,

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.920 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Now are there specific
eye exercises that you do?

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, many different ones.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You see, you can do
it in up and down,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.874 align:middle line:84%
you can do it in conjunction
with leg movements.

00:52:22.874 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You can do it when
you lie on your belly,

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.130 align:middle line:84%
you can do it when
you lie on your side.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.380 align:middle line:84%
You want to bring
richness of possibilities

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and then when you stand up
and just do your daily life,

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.077 align:middle line:84%
you find that you do it
differently and better.

00:52:33.077 --> 00:52:34.010 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Which is really great.

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole program
that's called Deskercises.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And you do all of
these exercises,

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.810 align:middle line:90%
you can do right from your desk.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:44.270 align:middle line:84%
ANAT: 40 different five-to-seven
minute movement lessons.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I could have
done 500, which is

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.950 align:middle line:90%
why we stopped at 40 for now.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:53.040 align:middle line:90%
And I call them brain pops.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Like lollipops for the brain.

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:55.941 align:middle line:84%
That's great.
-Yeah.

00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Now you work a lot
with autistic children,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have made
significant changes

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.780 align:middle line:90%
in their movement, behavior.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.490 align:middle line:84%
With the kids on
the autism spectrum?

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yes.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe, from my
observation, that nobody

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.490 align:middle line:90%
knows what causes it really.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have
different ideas.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
the cause exactly,

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.540 align:middle line:84%
but we know what we see,
that it's very, very tough.

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And my observation
leads me to think

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that the base of
this problem, it's

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.470 align:middle line:90%
really a neuromotor disorder.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Neuromotor disorder.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's a movement disorder,
it's a brain movement disorder.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And underneath it, it's actually
the brain has a difficult time

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.500 align:middle line:90%
perceiving differences.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So it can't differentiate and
it doesn't know what to do,

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.220 align:middle line:84%
so it gets flooded
with stimulation

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and it can't makes
sense of its world.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.580 align:middle line:90%
It can't organize the body well.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you look-- and
of course, cognition,

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:00.190 align:middle line:84%
interpersonal relationships,
all that stuff.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So people are very
impacted by the fact

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:90%
their kid's on the spectrum.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Here you see a beautiful
child and they don't talk

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:11.500 align:middle line:84%
or they can't relate and
it's just heartbreaking.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Because you go like, why?

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:13.760 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Yeah.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.990 align:middle line:84%
What I've found, and my
colleagues have found,

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
these kids-- like when I say
move and feel what you do?

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.530 align:middle line:84%
They're confused,
they don't know even

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:90%
what they feel as they move.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So we start working
with the movement

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and we get them
to start relating

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to the gravitational
field better,

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and know their up from the down.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very basic, but we
take them where they have holes

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and they spontaneously start
talking, they start relating.

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.960 align:middle line:84%
To my great surprise, many
of them start eating better.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have
real eating disorders,

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:49.550 align:middle line:90%
they can't tolerate many foods.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't work on food, but
somehow that connects.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:84%
The gut-brain connection,
whatever it does,

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.130 align:middle line:90%
that even gets better organized.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.720 align:middle line:10%
And I used to think that I
could only help kids that are up

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:10%
to maybe six, seven years old.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.210 align:middle line:10%
And now-- because parents, since
the book "Kids Beyond Limits"

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:10%
came out-- more and more
parents with kids that are older

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:12.270 align:middle line:10%
on the autism spectrum are
bringing them, and some of them

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.000 align:middle line:10%
we are seeing really
magnificent results.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So I was really wrong,
because I thought

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is too formed
by the time they're 13 or 10.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.344 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was wrong.

00:55:23.344 --> 00:55:24.310 align:middle line:90%
LISA: My god, that's amazing.

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we can't help all of
them as much, but many of them

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.890 align:middle line:90%
we help a lot.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.880 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing, even at
that-- no matter what age.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.600 align:middle line:84%
All right, well let's take
a look one more time at Anat

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in action and some
of the responsiveness

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that people get from her work.
Take a look.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:10%
So a big part of this work is
to actually become us, learn

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.270 align:middle line:10%
us, have the freedom to
use ourselves in the way we

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:57.990 align:middle line:10%
were built to be used.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That's one side of it.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The other side is to have
the brain and our feeling

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:11.500 align:middle line:84%
capacities and our capacity
to listen to ourselves

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and invent ourselves, you see?

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Because all those
things are discovered,

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.700 align:middle line:84%
there's no manual that
the [INAUDIBLE] says,

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:23.190 align:middle line:84%
rotate your leg, that'll
help your pelvis move which

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.150 align:middle line:84%
will help you roll over
more easy to your belly.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK, let me go try it.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It's all done by feeling.

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And the capacity to
feel, and the capacity

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.710 align:middle line:84%
to be guided by what you feel,
is one of the biggest gifts

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.230 align:middle line:90%
you'll get in this training.

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It'll also make you more
intelligent, trust me.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have many
different products

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that you have recorded
and done classes,

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and you've recorded
most of them on video.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So here's a picture of all
of the different things,

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:11.194 align:middle line:90%
your book that you wrote--

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.160 align:middle line:90%
ANAT: Well, I have two books.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I have "Kids Beyond
Limits," it's

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:15.740 align:middle line:84%
about the work with the
children with special needs,

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's great for all
parents with all kids

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.000 align:middle line:84%
because all kids
have special needs.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.270 align:middle line:90%
They need to grow and learn.

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And the second book
is "Move Into Life,"

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and that's for adults.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:28.030 align:middle line:10%
We have training programs
for practitioners,

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.720 align:middle line:10%
I do live seminars--

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So you teach.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I teach a lot.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you have practitioners
all over the country, right?

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.745 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:57:35.745 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And all over the world?

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot, but it's
starting to be more and more

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.350 align:middle line:90%
because we train practitioners.

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Well you need to train as many
as you can because this work is

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:48.400 align:middle line:84%
phenomenal, and for you
to be able to train people

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and for them to work under
you, it's an incredible honor

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's an honor
to have you here.

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.220 align:middle line:84%
What you've done
and the difference

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that you have made
in people's lives

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is so worth telling
people about.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So thank you very much for
being here, for showing us.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I hope you had a
great experience

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.510 align:middle line:84%
doing some of the
exercises with us,

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:06.820 align:middle line:90%
so thank you for being here.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Lisa.

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It really was a great
pleasure for me, too.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.120 align:middle line:90%
