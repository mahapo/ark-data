>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.788 align:middle line:84%
Do you sometimes wonder why
you do the things you do,

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:23.958 align:middle line:84%
or why do you always attract
the same type of relationship,

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.528 align:middle line:84%
or maybe attract the same type
of victimhood in your life.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.264 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you want to find the
answers to these questions

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and begin to break through
these mental barriers,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:84%
my guest today Joe Nunziata says
it all starts with your past.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.407 align:middle line:84%
Joe has been helping
people transform their lives

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.278 align:middle line:84%
for the past 25 years, and his
latest book, "Karma Buster,"

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.615 align:middle line:84%
talks about how to heal
yourself and create the life

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:48.983 align:middle line:90%
that you were meant to live.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:50.151 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, thanks for being here.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Nunziata:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:90%
So great to be here, thank you.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So great.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.323 align:middle line:84%
You come from a background
in sales and marketing.

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:59.026 align:middle line:90%
Now you've written about karma.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.094 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:01.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Yeah,
kind of a crazy thing.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.532 align:middle line:84%
I started my career in sales and
marketing and then later got

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:07.134 align:middle line:84%
involved in metaphysical work
and energy work, and again,

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.402 align:middle line:90%
it's been a big part of my life.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.338 align:middle line:84%
I started to integrate those
principles into business,

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.974 align:middle line:84%
and then little by little
started to go deeper and deeper,

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.743 align:middle line:84%
and now really doing a
lot of clearing work,

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:18.045 align:middle line:84%
and working with people and
people's karma and energy

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.647 align:middle line:90%
and helping people heal.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.748 align:middle line:84%
So it's been certainly an
interesting trip.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Now where did you --

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.619 align:middle line:84%
why did you make that
transition, though, from sales

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.123 align:middle line:84%
and marketing and then being
interested in metaphysical life

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:30.758 align:middle line:90%
and karma and so forth?

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, you know,I
was always interested in kind of

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.796 align:middle line:84%
even as a very young kid I
was reading the success books

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and the goal-setting books.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.666 align:middle line:84%
I was always doing
that kind of work.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.402 align:middle line:84%
Then as I got a little
bit older I started to go

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.304 align:middle line:84%
through problems, I started
to have a lot of issues,

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:45.739 align:middle line:84%
unresolved issues, went
through bankruptcies.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.641 align:middle line:84%
I was having all these
different upsets,

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.246 align:middle line:84%
so I actually began with
therapy, which Italian kids

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.581 align:middle line:84%
from Brooklyn don't
do, by the way.

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.349 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's not what we do.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.452 align:middle line:84%
So I started out with therapy
and I did that for a while,

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.088 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years, and
it really helped me begin

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.058 align:middle line:84%
to see things differently and
frame things in a different way.

00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:05.859 align:middle line:90%
And from that position I started

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to learn more how
your mind works,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:90%
and started to take classes,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.931 align:middle line:84%
and then started to learn about
metaphysical principles.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.633 align:middle line:84%
As you know you start
meeting different teachers,

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.835 align:middle line:84%
and it just kind
of went from there.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Goes on from there.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.638 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about your childhood,

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.473 align:middle line:90%
growing up as a kid in Brooklyn,

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
and where did you
grow up, what area?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, I'm actually
from Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:26.312 align:middle line:90%
which now has become very hip.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.881 align:middle line:84%
When I was there
it wasn't that hip.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.683 align:middle line:84%
Then it got really
bad at one point,

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.651 align:middle line:84%
and now it's become
a very nice area.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.421 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of lower middle
class part of Brooklyn.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.957 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a New York City
cop, my mom stayed home,

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:37.958 align:middle line:90%
I had a younger sister.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we lived
in a building,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.095 align:middle line:90%
and you know, kind of thing.

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.663 align:middle line:84%
Played in the street
in front of the house.

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.498 align:middle line:84%
It was a normal kind
of a situation.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.269 align:middle line:84%
We moved, actually, the
upgrade was going from Brooklyn

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.571 align:middle line:84%
to Queens, which is
the next part over,

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.373 align:middle line:84%
which is a little more
suburban, so that was --

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:53.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That was the upgrade.

00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:54.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That
was a big step up.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And your father being
a New York City police officer,

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.612 align:middle line:90%
was that rough on the family?

00:02:58.612 --> 00:02:59.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle line:90%
He was never home.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.649 align:middle line:84%
He actually started
as a regular officer,

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.951 align:middle line:84%
then became a detective
in narcotics.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:06.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So I remember
-- you know, it's funny,

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.521 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
this earlier,

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
but I remember growing up, him
never being home for dinner,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.526 align:middle line:84%
never one dinner that
he was in the house.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.095 align:middle line:84%
So he was never around, he
was kind of always working,

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:17.531 align:middle line:84%
and even on the weekend
he'd come in and go out.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.868 align:middle line:84%
So he was really out
there, constantly working

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.036 align:middle line:90%
and doing whatever he was doing.

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:24.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did he ever
bring home that mentality

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.908 align:middle line:84%
or that frustration or was he
exhausted when you did see him?

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Yeah, he was
good when you saw him,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.612 align:middle line:84%
he was kind of, you know,
not around that much.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
He was -- and he was distracted.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.683 align:middle line:84%
I would say very
distracted and very involved

00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:37.951 align:middle line:84%
in what he was doing, and
going through his own issues,

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.086 align:middle line:84%
which of course I
didn't know then.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:41.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: But
certainly understand now.

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Then at one
point he didn't come home?

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.895 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 years old he
actually went out one day

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and was -- as it turns
out, was murdered.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.264 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what happened.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
When he first died they
said it was a suicide.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really
know what happened.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:90%
That was back in the '70s.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How old were you?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: I was 12.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:00.941 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, you know, coming
home from school and finding

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.311 align:middle line:84%
out what had happened, and
then that was it, and obviously

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:06.747 align:middle line:90%
that was the end of it.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You -- you tell the
story in one of your books

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:11.218 align:middle line:84%
about the officers
coming to your house.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.921 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
that memory, if you don't mind.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, I remember --
you know, I actually got there,

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.125 align:middle line:84%
the officers came to see
my mom and then I got home

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.327 align:middle line:84%
after school, and I
remember walking in

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.495 align:middle line:84%
and seeing all these
people in the house.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.629 align:middle line:90%
It was the middle of the week

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.365 align:middle line:84%
and of course I didn't
know what was going on.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:84%
I remember my mom grabbing me
and saying daddy went to heaven.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:29.837 align:middle line:90%
It was just one of those things.

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:31.805 align:middle line:84%
It's a very -- you know,
just a shocking thing,

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
because he was 38 years
old, and you come home,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
you're a kid coming
home from school.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.813 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was March in
New York, it was just starting

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:40.881 align:middle line:90%
to get a little nicer weather.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.149 align:middle line:84%
I was walking home
with my friend,

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:43.684 align:middle line:84%
we had just gotten
baseball cards.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.352 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of like a normal --

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:48.255 align:middle line:84%
just amazing, and I
think what was wonderful

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.791 align:middle line:84%
about the experience for me
now, obviously going back,

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.861 align:middle line:84%
was you see how your
whole life can be

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:57.431 align:middle line:84%
so immediately changed
in one moment.

00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:58.999 align:middle line:84%
And it's something I don't
think we think about.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.768 align:middle line:84%
I think we get up every
day, we go to work,

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:04.204 align:middle line:84%
or we do whatever we're doing,
our kids go to school.

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:05.205 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think of
all of these things.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
when something

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:08.842 align:middle line:84%
like that happens,
it stays with you.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:09.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:10.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And now
when something happens

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.113 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's almost like oh,
okay.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:16.517 align:middle line:84%
Anything can -- you start at
a young age I realized, oh,

00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:18.786 align:middle line:84%
anything can happen
at any moment.

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did that cause
you to live your life

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:25.726 align:middle line:84%
in a more conscious way
now or are you more in fear

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.661 align:middle line:90%
of life changing at any moment?

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I think I
was very fearful younger.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:33.534 align:middle line:84%
I know as a younger person
I had tremendous fear

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:36.136 align:middle line:84%
of that happening to me,
because you're like, oh, okay,

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
this happened to my dad who
I saw as this super hero,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.743 align:middle line:84%
tough guy cop, rough
kind of guy,

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:45.446 align:middle line:90%
very athletic, very physical.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.047 align:middle line:84%
You know, kind of --
you saw your father --

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:48.449 align:middle line:84%
you know, most people see
their dads like that ,

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
but he was really like that.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.553 align:middle line:84%
He was a former baseball player,
played for the New York Giants

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:54.621 align:middle line:84%
in the minor leagues, I mean,
so this guy was like, you know,

00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:58.325 align:middle line:84%
he was like a -- so for that to
happen to him, was like, wow,

00:05:58.325 --> 00:05:59.893 align:middle line:90%
you know, anything can happen.

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:84%
So just really shatters
your reality a little.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you don't
mind going back

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:09.303 align:middle line:84%
into that story a little bit,
that time, it was a conspiracy

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.872 align:middle line:84%
that happened within the
police department, right?

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.608 align:middle line:84%
So there was betrayal
there as well, right?

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yes.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:16.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:17.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Well, it was funny,

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:20.147 align:middle line:84%
because when he passed it was
a lot of corruption in New York

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:21.548 align:middle line:90%
at that time, in New York City.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.183 align:middle line:90%
So my mother got no pension

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.152 align:middle line:84%
because they said
he killed himself.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:27.788 align:middle line:84%
And there was really -- but
what came out later which was

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.523 align:middle line:84%
so fascinating, and
of course I found this

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:31.258 align:middle line:84%
all out as I got older,
I didn't know at 12.

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:33.293 align:middle line:84%
As I got older I started
to talk to people and some

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:35.662 align:middle line:84%
of his former cops
that worked with him.

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:36.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: At what age
did you start to --

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I was probably,
like late teens, 18, 19. I

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.901 align:middle line:84%
started to, you know, get in
there.

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.704 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened was he had
been shot with his own gun.

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:45.072 align:middle line:90%
And he was left handed.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.641 align:middle line:84%
And the bullet kind
of entered his chest

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:48.609 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way up here.

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.777 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
they said, well,

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.913 align:middle line:84%
it's almost virtually
impossible for him to do that at

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that angle, and our attorney
for the family said I want

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.086 align:middle line:84%
to get the clothing, because
the clothing will prove

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.454 align:middle line:90%
if he did it.

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:01.722 align:middle line:84%
Because if he did it, his hand
would have to be very close

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.957 align:middle line:84%
and there would be powder
burns on the clothing.

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:84%
So when they went to get
the clothing it was missing.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So this would have
proved, you know,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.899 align:middle line:90%
that this was not possible.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.467 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this
corruption going on.

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:15.469 align:middle line:90%
So we didn't get any money,

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.538 align:middle line:84%
which of course was another
whole tremendously stressful

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle line:84%
circumstances that my mom, you
know, it was very hard for her,

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.843 align:middle line:84%
a 12-year-old and my
10-year-old sister.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And she was
not working at the time.

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:26.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Not working at the
time, had not worked in years,

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:28.015 align:middle line:84%
since we were kids, you
know, was a stay at home mom.

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're not getting
any pay --

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.787 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing was just very
traumatic on many levels.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.324 align:middle line:84%
And I knew -- so for years
I'm kind of saying, well,

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.092 align:middle line:84%
we never really knew
what happened.

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was it because your
instinct was telling you there's

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
no way he could have
committed suicide.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I think you never
want to think, of course,

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:90%
that your dad did that.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.536 align:middle line:84%
I don't care who you are, you
just don't want to think that.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:84%
My mom kind of I
think thought he did.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.909 align:middle line:84%
And kind of made us feel
a little bit like he did.

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.179 align:middle line:84%
But my side of it was always
kind of saying, well,

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:84%
there's too many
holes in this story.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.216 align:middle line:84%
Especially as I was getting
older and learning more things.

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:03.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:04.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.752 align:middle line:84%
I always kind of
had that feeling

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
that that was not true,
but I didn't know.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.824 align:middle line:84%
Some days it kind of
went back and forth.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you ever want
to go back and be a detective

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.494 align:middle line:90%
or follow in his footsteps?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:84%
At any moment did that
thought cross your mind?

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: No.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No?

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I remember my mom,
I was really small, and she said

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.103 align:middle line:84%
if you ever become a cop
I'll kill you myself.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:24.671 align:middle line:90%
So it was kind of like --

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.772 align:middle line:90%
that was not part

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:27.608 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation that
we were going to have.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.343 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things where
she said to me, you know,

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:30.777 align:middle line:90%
that is not happening.

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:31.777 align:middle line:90%
Don't even think -- not

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:32.979 align:middle line:84%
that I was even thinking
about it, but --

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:35.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But in an
interesting way, and this part

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:37.551 align:middle line:84%
of the story is amazing,
that you found

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.519 align:middle line:84%
out through a very
metaphysical way.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.921 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that?

00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:44.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, in 1997 I was
actually working selling cable

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:48.328 align:middle line:84%
advertising in New York, on Long
Island, which is where we lived.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:52.766 align:middle line:84%
So my wife's friend had made an
appointment with John Edward.

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:53.533 align:middle line:90%
Now you know John Edward?

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, the medium.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: The medium.

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:58.305 align:middle line:84%
Now understand in 1997, he
has no books, no TV shows,

00:08:58.305 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows who he is.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.509 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who he was, but
he was kind of known out there.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.946 align:middle line:84%
So once a month you would call
up and make an appointment.

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:09.049 align:middle line:84%
So my wife's friend made an
appointment and couldn't go.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And he was
in the local area?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: He was right --

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:12.819 align:middle line:84%
from where I lived he
was 15 minutes away.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.121 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
this out of his home.

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So I'll
never forget.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
My wife called me up, and she
said listen, my friend can't go

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.129 align:middle line:84%
to this appointment, she
knows you lost your dad,

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.231 align:middle line:84%
this guy's a medium,
why don't you go?

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.666 align:middle line:90%
You could take the appointment.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.235 align:middle line:84%
Because it was really hard to
get an appointment with him.

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I was working, it
was a long time ago,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.272 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of just
dabbling in this work,

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.141 align:middle line:90%
not really knowing that much.

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:37.477 align:middle line:84%
And I said all right, you
know, give me the address,

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll go there, what time
is it, 4:30, 5 o'clock,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.882 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm working, later in the
day I'll take a ride out there.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.083 align:middle line:90%
Didn't really think about it.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.552 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
driving, driving over there.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.522 align:middle line:84%
I started to say what am
I doing, who is this guy,

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
talking to dead people,
you know,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.892 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a weird thing.

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:56.063 align:middle line:84%
So now you start to
think as we all do,

00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.998 align:middle line:90%
what could this person be like?

00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:01.068 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking does he have a cape
and a smoke machine, or what --

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04.337 align:middle line:90%
like a weird guy, like, no idea.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't known,
he wasn't on TV.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So I get there, and
you've seen him, right?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.712 align:middle line:90%
Regular-looking.

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact he had
a T-shirt and jeans on.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.182 align:middle line:84%
Comes to the door, said how
are you doing, I'm John.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
He said I have a woman
who was supposed to come.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.086 align:middle line:84%
I said she couldn't come and
I'm taking her appointment.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:90%
He said oh, okay.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.254 align:middle line:90%
Just tell me your first name.

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
He brought me up
into a home office.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.158 align:middle line:84%
So this was supposed to
be -- I'm thinking --

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what this
guy, has a crystal ball,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.462 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he's going to do.

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:31.965 align:middle line:84%
And he brings me into this
very simple home office,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.669 align:middle line:84%
he sits at the desk, he says
okay, this is what I do.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.271 align:middle line:84%
He said don't try to
reach for anything.

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:40.073 align:middle line:84%
I don't decide who
comes through.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.541 align:middle line:84%
We go through this
whole little thing.

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:42.509 align:middle line:84%
He says -- if you've
seen the show,

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
if it's above it
means they're older,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.779 align:middle line:84%
if I say they're
moderate it's the same,

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.781 align:middle line:84%
if I say below they're
younger than you.

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
He kind of gives you this
little speech before.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.818 align:middle line:90%
And then he just goes into it.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.088 align:middle line:84%
So now we're sitting
there, and I'm kind of --

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.224 align:middle line:84%
I purposely went in
a little skeptical.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:59.426 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm not going to
give him any information,

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:02.529 align:middle line:84%
that was my, you know,
New York sales guy,

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.098 align:middle line:84%
I'm not giving you
anything, you prove it to me.

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:06.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Prove it, yeah.

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Prove to
me you can do this.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So we sit down, and
he says I have Joseph.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.471 align:middle line:90%
My father is Joseph.

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:12.305 align:middle line:90%
But I'm Joseph.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.707 align:middle line:90%
So I said well that's, okay,

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.509 align:middle line:84%
that's not that big
of a stretch.

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:20.747 align:middle line:84%
So we're just starting, he said
okay, he's showing me a badge.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:24.518 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't wear the uniform
because he was a detective.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.287 align:middle line:84%
And he said he's showing
me a camel hair coat.

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:28.955 align:middle line:84%
And my father had
a camel hair coat

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:30.857 align:middle line:84%
that he wore every single
day, and as a matter

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
of fact he was an extra
in the French Connection

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.996 align:middle line:84%
because those were his
friends who broke that case,

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:38.598 align:middle line:84%
and he's wearing the camel
hair coat in the movie.

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:84%
So now this is the first ten
seconds of the conversation.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.805 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bolted to my seat,
I'm like, oh my goodness.

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:47.974 align:middle line:84%
Because that wasn't an off the
wall detail, that's a real --

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.776 align:middle line:84%
and he starts going into
this thing, and he says well,

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.212 align:middle line:84%
you know, your father
died outside,

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.114 align:middle line:90%
which he did, he was in a car.

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:55.782 align:middle line:84%
And he said your father
died near his house.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:58.285 align:middle line:90%
Did he die near your house?

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:00.687 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he died
about four or five blocks away

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:02.823 align:middle line:84%
from where he grew
up in Brooklyn.

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.758 align:middle line:90%
Then he stopped.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.226 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting,

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.962 align:middle line:84%
because you could see he
stopped, he kind of hesitated,

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.531 align:middle line:84%
said well, I don't
want to offend you,

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.568 align:middle line:84%
but was he involved
with the Mafia.

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.936 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
dealing with drug dealers

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.304 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.139 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to offend you,
but this is what's coming in.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.874 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me
he just wants you

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.543 align:middle line:84%
to know he knew the guys who
did it, they got in the back

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.812 align:middle line:84%
of the car, they took
his gun, he kind of went

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.048 align:middle line:84%
through the whole
of what had happened.

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.749 align:middle line:84%
He said I can't tell
you who they are,

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.218 align:middle line:90%
but he knows who they are.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:34.554 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to accept
responsibility

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:38.258 align:middle line:84%
for placing himself in
that dangerous position.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.127 align:middle line:90%
Gives me chills.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So this is --

00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:44.698 align:middle line:84%
obviously, that was
a life-changing day.

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:47.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Why did he not
tell you who they were?

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.002 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't or --

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: He just
said it's not, you know,

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:54.507 align:middle line:84%
it's just not something
that I will do.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.276 align:middle line:84%
So he said -- it
isn't necessary.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.311 align:middle line:84%
It's really for you to
just be at peace with this

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to understand what happened,
so you don't carry this

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.849 align:middle line:84%
with you another
twenty-five years.

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:05.619 align:middle line:84%
It was already whatever
years at that point,

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.153 align:middle line:90%
it had already happened.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what did you
do with that information,

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:84%
you walked out of there,
you were a teenager?

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: No, I was
-- I was in my twenties.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.999 align:middle line:84%
Well, first I got into my car
and I was actually shaking

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.568 align:middle line:84%
because you're in that energy,
too, as you know when you're

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.303 align:middle line:84%
in the energy of those people
and you're doing that kind

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:27.073 align:middle line:84%
of a circumstances, you do
come out in a different field.

00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:29.476 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting in the car,
I remember I grabbed a paper

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.978 align:middle line:84%
and pen because he said
so many things so quickly.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.713 align:middle line:84%
That I couldn't -- I
was trying to remember,

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:35.782 align:middle line:84%
and I just started writing
things down, and he said numbers

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:38.184 align:middle line:84%
and he said names, and
he said different things.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:41.454 align:middle line:84%
So I was just trying to
just remember it all.

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I got home and my
wife said what happened,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.191 align:middle line:84%
and I tell her this whole
unbelievable story.

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.694 align:middle line:84%
And that really was
like, okay, that was kind

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.796 align:middle line:84%
of a defining moment for me
in a sense that it said okay,

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:52.332 align:middle line:84%
there's something really
happening here that's a lot

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.167 align:middle line:90%
bigger than you think.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:58.171 align:middle line:84%
And then I really started
to dive into the work

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.372 align:middle line:90%
at a lot deeper level.

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:03.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What about the
unveiled murder of your --

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:04.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: That was just --

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle line:84%
you know what, that was
just a feeling of closure.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You didn't go after
that and go back to the --

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:11.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: No, no.

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.787 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't -- you know, it
was so long ago at that point,

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:14.854 align:middle line:90%
twenty-some-odd years later.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:18.959 align:middle line:84%
I felt like okay, that
can't be resolved.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.561 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's -- and I
have no evidence, you know,

00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:23.129 align:middle line:90%
what am I supposed to say?

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:25.131 align:middle line:84%
I went to this guy
and he told me.

00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You didn't go back at
all, and you weren't curious

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:29.202 align:middle line:84%
to look at any of the
records or anything?

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You know,
I had looked always

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:32.072 align:middle line:84%
at the old newspapers
and stuff like that.

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But there was really
nothing definitive in there.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of it for me
was just being at peace with it.

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.879 align:middle line:84%
Just say okay, you know what,
this is what happened, let

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.247 align:middle line:84%
it go. Let it -- that was
the message I got

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.883 align:middle line:90%
out of it was just let it go.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:47.187 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to carry this
burden in your life anymore

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:48.588 align:middle line:90%
of this whole unresolved issue,

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:49.356 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
what happened.

00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What a healing.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:52.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: It was a
tremendously healing experience.

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So that got you started
on your path of the metaphysics?

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Although I believe

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:58.798 align:middle line:84%
I got started on my path when my
dad passed in a different way.

00:14:58.798 --> 00:14:59.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What do you mean?

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: As far as I think

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.269 align:middle line:84%
when that incident
happened it turned my path,

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.438 align:middle line:84%
because it changed the
direction of my life.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:06.873 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I would
be doing this work had

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.141 align:middle line:90%
that not happened.

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:09.376 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because you
unveiled a whole other meaning

00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:11.878 align:middle line:90%
in life, right?

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:13.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Just
changed everything.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.048 align:middle line:84%
I probably would have been like
-- would have gone to school,

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.384 align:middle line:90%
would have gone to college,

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.919 align:middle line:84%
probably gotten a
regular career, who knows.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.022 align:middle line:90%
But I don't feel like --

00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:24.824 align:middle line:84%
my feeling is I would not
have gone down this road.

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:28.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So this road now
leads us to the karma book

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:32.632 align:middle line:84%
and how did you relate what
you know now and have written

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.001 align:middle line:84%
and studied a lot
about karma back

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to that situation
with your father?

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, the
understanding was --

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:41.441 align:middle line:84%
understanding first
of all what is karma.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:45.278 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a word that
you hear all over the place.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:90%
There's even credit karma --

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah, there is.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:48.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So the
word is out there a lot

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:50.517 align:middle line:84%
of I think we've heard it
since we're little kids.

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.552 align:middle line:84%
And the old definition
when I talked

00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:54.154 align:middle line:84%
to people is what goes
around comes around.

00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:55.989 align:middle line:84%
If I do something bad,
something bad happens,

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.791 align:middle line:84%
if I do something good
-- which is such a --

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.995 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like giving you a
crumb for what it really is.

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.564 align:middle line:84%
So as I did the work
I understood

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:08.068 align:middle line:84%
that really was we're here to
do is have an emotional journey.

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:09.969 align:middle line:90%
So your karma is tied to --

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.038 align:middle line:84%
I define it as a
blueprint, right?

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:16.309 align:middle line:84%
It's the blueprint for
your emotional journey.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle line:84%
We come here I think in physical
form, we're very mental,

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.713 align:middle line:84%
and we think about what
we're going to accomplish

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.516 align:middle line:84%
or what we're going to
do, you're doing this work

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:25.118 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing all
these wonderful things.

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:26.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We have
strong minds, yes.

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Strong
-- I'm writing a book,

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:30.557 align:middle line:84%
you're doing this, who's the
architect, who's making a movie,

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:33.093 align:middle line:84%
and we're here in
California, right?

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:34.894 align:middle line:84%
But that's not really what
we're here -- that's --

00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:84%
we're just part of
the experience

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:84%
to have this emotional
experience.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle line:84%
So I think we place
that experience ahead

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.837 align:middle line:84%
of the real experience
that we're here to have,

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.705 align:middle line:84%
which is really the
emotional experience.

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now what about the
religious references to karma?

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:52.912 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you researched
all of that, have you tied any

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.547 align:middle line:90%
of that into this book?

00:16:54.547 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Not really, because
it was not about religion.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.086 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up Catholic,
which is another whole book

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:02.288 align:middle line:90%
that I have to write on day.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:05.091 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Italian Catholic
growing up in New York.

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%
Which is another --

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Talking about karma.

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:08.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That's
a real other story.

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's a movie.

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:10.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That's a --
that's a -- definite --

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
that's like a mini-series.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.198 align:middle line:90%
We have to make that.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I think it's
called the Sopranos.

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:17.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Oh, it's
already been done.

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
See, they actually address a lot
of those issues with the mother

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.042 align:middle line:84%
and the guilt and all
those feelings and emotions

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.577 align:middle line:90%
that come up in that show.

00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:27.981 align:middle line:84%
Growing up in that world, that
was very relatable for me,

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
not that we were gangsters
although we were involved

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.152 align:middle line:84%
in some level with
my dad and whatever.

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:34.454 align:middle line:84%
But you know, those feelings
and emotions of the guilt

00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and the shame and what you're
supposed to do, and the sense

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.528 align:middle line:84%
of obligation that we had in
that culture, that was all part

00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
of the experience
that I came to have.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.732 align:middle line:90%
And then break those cycles,

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.067 align:middle line:84%
and then start creating
life in a different way.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:52.372 align:middle line:84%
But all part of my experience
to give you the depth now

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.606 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do the work.

00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:56.209 align:middle line:84%
And that was always part
of it for me, whenever I go

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:58.545 align:middle line:84%
through my struggles, which
we all do, and say you know,

00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:00.146 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand what's
going on, and this is, like,

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:01.748 align:middle line:84%
getting hard, and things
aren't working out.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.384 align:middle line:84%
And then I understood
later to say oh,

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.752 align:middle line:90%
you had to understand that,

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.221 align:middle line:84%
because that's something you
are now going to teach people.

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:11.724 align:middle line:84%
So in teaching about
karma, how did you relate

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:15.461 align:middle line:84%
that entire experience that
happened with you as a child

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:19.966 align:middle line:84%
and your father to
a karmic occurrence?

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, the
first thing that I think

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.102 align:middle line:84%
that people have to do, and
this is the hardest part,

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:26.773 align:middle line:84%
I really believe this
in the early stages.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:30.243 align:middle line:84%
Accepting that that
was your path.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:32.478 align:middle line:84%
So saying this is -- like, this
is

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:35.181 align:middle line:84%
where I think the rubber
meets the road, so to speak.

00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
situation that's difficult

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
or you have a hard
circumstances,

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.753 align:middle line:84%
and we all have it
on some level.

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:44.057 align:middle line:84%
And then you have I can be a
victim, and I can feel sorry

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:45.491 align:middle line:84%
for myself, I can say
look what happened to me,

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can say wow, my
life was very hard.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.763 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it wasn't, a
lot of people had worse than me,

00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:52.632 align:middle line:84%
and worse than you,
and whatever.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:58.004 align:middle line:84%
But it's the understanding that
that was what you are here to do

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:02.041 align:middle line:84%
and the acceptance of that,
that creates power for you

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
to say oh, that's why I am here.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:90%
Not this happened to me.

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:10.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So in your
definition of karma, what is it?

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
You've given us a wonderful set
of slides here that kind of talk

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.822 align:middle line:84%
about this, and you
teach about karma.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.423 align:middle line:84%
What is your definition
of karma?

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:19.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: My definition
is it's the blueprint

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:22.795 align:middle line:84%
for the emotional experience
you're here to have.

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:27.467 align:middle line:84%
So you're here, your soul,
let's look at your soul comes

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.303 align:middle line:84%
and says okay, this is what
I like to tell people

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.605 align:middle line:84%
because I think it
makes it funny.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:36.943 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of this work
I like to fool around with it

00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:39.012 align:middle line:90%
because it can get very heavy.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:41.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And we need to
lighten it up a little bit.

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:42.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, it can
go down a long road.

00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: A very dark road.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: As you know, it
can go down a very bad road.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:50.256 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to say to people
is imagine before you came you

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:53.159 align:middle line:84%
made a list of feelings
that you came to feel.

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.962 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel abandonment,
I want to feel what it feels

00:19:55.962 --> 00:19:58.164 align:middle line:84%
like to have no money, I
want to feel what it feels

00:19:58.164 --> 00:19:59.699 align:middle line:90%
like to be sick physically.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.302 align:middle line:90%
I want to know -- this is my --

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
kind of my order
for this lifetime.

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.906 align:middle line:90%
And before you came it's

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:08.074 align:middle line:84%
like you placed the
order in a restaurant.

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:09.342 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want to do.

00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:13.713 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't know that,
unfortunately, when you come,

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.149 align:middle line:84%
to say oh, okay, that's
what I came here to do.

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:17.684 align:middle line:90%
But that's really what happened.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.386 align:middle line:84%
So now you're here
with this blueprint

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:21.487 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know about.

00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:22.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Having this experience

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.491 align:middle line:84%
that you think just
is an accident.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:26.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Just happening.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:27.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And it isn't.

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:28.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: It's not.

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How does this
relate to the chakras.

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:31.731 align:middle line:84%
You have a slide
here of the chakras.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.067 align:middle line:84%
So the chakra system --
the chakras, of course,

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.369 align:middle line:84%
which is the ancient
system, right?

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.738 align:middle line:84%
The Sanskrit word
meaning spiral.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.506 align:middle line:84%
So you have these chakras
throughout your body.

00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:44.844 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is as you're
born, your base or root chakra

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:47.146 align:middle line:84%
immediately, the minute
you're conceived,

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:50.216 align:middle line:84%
begins to develop
from the bottom up.

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:53.086 align:middle line:84%
You absorb energy through
each chakra, through each year

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.722 align:middle line:84%
of your life, until you're
about eight years old.

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:57.724 align:middle line:84%
And you're absorbing
all these experiences

00:20:57.724 --> 00:20:59.659 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime which are

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.528 align:middle line:84%
in effect creating
that blueprint here.

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:05.765 align:middle line:84%
So even though you came with it,
you need to recreate it here.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.633 align:middle line:84%
So you've had all of those
emotional experiences here

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:10.536 align:middle line:84%
already, but you had
them all as a child.

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:12.538 align:middle line:84%
So once you're about eight
years old you're done.

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:14.974 align:middle line:84%
And then you go out
and just keep going

00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:17.443 align:middle line:84%
through these feelings
until you resolve them,

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:18.644 align:middle line:90%
you just keep repeating.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Repeating them, right.

00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:23.616 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so this is essentially
what we're doing is the

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.119 align:middle line:84%
evolvement out of karma goes
through and up and out --

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.187 align:middle line:84%
you're saying you can
evolve out of karma.

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:31.357 align:middle line:84%
You can understand and
be aware of it enough

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:35.161 align:middle line:84%
and be conscious enough
about your karmic pattern

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
then eventually not repeat
it by being conscious of it?

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Well, no.

00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:39.599 align:middle line:90%
Not just being --

00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:42.235 align:middle line:84%
this is a part that we want
to be very clear about.

00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:43.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Please.

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:43.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Because this is

00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:44.937 align:middle line:84%
where people get
kind of trapped.

00:21:44.937 --> 00:21:45.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:46.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: People think,

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:48.741 align:middle line:84%
and this has happened a
million times with people,

00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:52.545 align:middle line:84%
myself included, because
your ego is a big thing.

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:56.849 align:middle line:84%
That once I get this
in my head, I've got it.

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm done with it,
I don't have karma any more.

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Or I
understand it now,

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
now I understand what my
problem is, I can control it.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.359 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we have people
in therapy for thirty years

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.427 align:middle line:90%
with the same problem.

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:09.128 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
what their problem is,

00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:13.099 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't resolve
it emotionally.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can you ever
truly break karma?

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:15.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Oh yeah.

00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, that is great.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.006 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: We want to
break the cycle or the wheel,

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.574 align:middle line:90%
because we're on a wheel.

00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:90%
So what we're doing is --

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:26.412 align:middle line:84%
what we're really doing is we're
breaking the cycle or the wheel

00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:28.981 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and then
we can recreate.

00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You have a
great proverb here

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:32.118 align:middle line:90%
from the Zen proverb.

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:35.021 align:middle line:84%
It says the obstacle
is the path.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is what you're
going through here

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.227 align:middle line:84%
is helping us understand
that this is something

00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:43.996 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have to repeat.

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:45.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: But again, that --

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I love the Zen proverbs
because they're very simplistic,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.035 align:middle line:90%
but they're very powerful.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:50.169 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite one.

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:51.704 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
my favorite is

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
because it basically
is saying accept

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.942 align:middle line:90%
that this is what it is.

00:22:55.942 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:90%
The obstacle is the path.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is.

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.415 align:middle line:84%
So once you accept that,
you can read Buddha, it

00:23:02.415 --> 00:23:05.384 align:middle line:84%
talks about it, you read -- all
these different philosophers,

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.521 align:middle line:84%
you go back and back, life is
about understanding pain

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:09.755 align:middle line:84%
and suffering and
dealing with that,

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:12.058 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how to go through it.

00:23:12.058 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
M. Scott Peck talks
about it in his book,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.061 align:middle line:90%
"The Road Less -- first sentence

00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:17.029 align:middle line:84%
of the book is, "Life
is difficult."

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:18.331 align:middle line:90%
He talks about it.

00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:20.867 align:middle line:84%
So we have -- but I think
we are in a resistance state

00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:23.636 align:middle line:84%
of everything and that's what
creates all the problems for us.

00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:24.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:26.806 align:middle line:84%
So accept the fact
that this is the case,

00:23:26.806 --> 00:23:29.108 align:middle line:84%
stop trying to Pollyanna
your way out of it,

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:31.177 align:middle line:90%
and stop recycling it.

00:23:31.177 --> 00:23:32.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.113 align:middle line:84%
Because now what's happening is
because you're not accepting it,

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
see you understand everything is
-- energy is always ying yang,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
we have positive charge,
we have negative charge.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.955 align:middle line:84%
So I'm either in -- and this
is something that's very easy

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
for people and one of the
things I teach early on,

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:48.394 align:middle line:84%
to say throughout the day say
to yourself am I in a state

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:51.364 align:middle line:84%
of acceptance or am I in
a state of resistance?

00:23:51.364 --> 00:23:53.633 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:23:53.633 --> 00:23:54.967 align:middle line:84%
So throughout the day,
and you'll be amazed --

00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what if you're
in the state of resistance?

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:23:58.738 --> 00:23:59.572 align:middle line:84%
So now you're at least
-- you know that.

00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:00.773 align:middle line:90%
Most people tons know that.

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.009 align:middle line:84%
They're living in a state
of tremendous resistance

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:04.977 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know it.

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:07.213 align:middle line:90%
So every day they're embattled.

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:11.017 align:middle line:84%
They come home, they're
beat up, they're tired,

00:24:11.017 --> 00:24:12.485 align:middle line:84%
they're fighting their
way through the day

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:15.187 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
fighting and battling,

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:18.591 align:middle line:84%
instead of just saying oh,
I'm resisting everything.

00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:19.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So with the resistance,

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:23.963 align:middle line:84%
if you just drop the resistance
then it reveals what is?

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Now
you can be clear.

00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:28.935 align:middle line:84%
Because now I'm accepting
that this is what's going on.

00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:32.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So in this slide that
you have here: recycle, reuse.

00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:33.773 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what karma is?

00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:35.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That I'm
recycling, I'm on a wheel.

00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:37.543 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a cycle or a wheel.

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:40.179 align:middle line:84%
So the wheel is based
on a desire.

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:84%
So your soul says I want
to feel what it feels

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.885 align:middle line:90%
like to be unworthy.

00:24:45.885 --> 00:24:46.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Let's say
that's the feeling.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.589 align:middle line:84%
That at this moment,
because you're going to go --

00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:51.824 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, you know,
we used to make a joke,

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:55.294 align:middle line:84%
my teacher who was also funny
with this, she would say well,

00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:58.464 align:middle line:84%
you clear one feeling and
then there's another one.

00:24:58.464 --> 00:24:59.999 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, thank you very much.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.233 align:middle line:90%
I thought I would be done.

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, because we're
very linear in our thinking,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.706 align:middle line:84%
because we want to get a
diploma and say I'm done,

00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:09.275 align:middle line:84%
I did my chakras, I'm done
now, which it doesn't work out.

00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:10.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm done
with my karma now.

00:25:10.409 --> 00:25:12.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: My karma is
finished, I can move on.

00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:13.079 align:middle line:90%
There's always another feeling.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:15.114 align:middle line:84%
Now the good news is
as you do the work

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:17.183 align:middle line:84%
for a while you can move through
the feelings very quickly.

00:25:17.183 --> 00:25:19.952 align:middle line:84%
In the early days when of
course in my resistance

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:22.088 align:middle line:84%
and negativity, it's
much harder.

00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:25.992 align:middle line:84%
So your soul says I
want to feel unworthy.

00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel whatever it is.

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:29.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it's going to do
whatever it can to create that.

00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:30.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: It's
going to create --

00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:31.731 align:middle line:84%
unless you are aware
enough to say wow,

00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling unworthy now, I need
to work on that, I don't want

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.303 align:middle line:90%
to create a physical experience.

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:39.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So in your
case, abandonment.

00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:41.574 align:middle line:84%
You said that was one of
the core issues for you?

00:25:41.574 --> 00:25:43.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That is
my big core issue.

00:25:43.943 --> 00:25:45.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It is still?

00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:48.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I think to a degree
those core issues are so deep,

00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:51.617 align:middle line:84%
and I always work on that one,
and I'm always very aware of it.

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And now it is obviously
much, much better.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.857 align:middle line:84%
But it is something that
I still keep an eye on.

00:25:57.857 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But that's
important that you said that.

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.661 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever
completely get rid of it,

00:26:01.661 --> 00:26:04.363 align:middle line:84%
you just have more tools
on how to handle it and see

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:07.933 align:middle line:84%
when it comes up as opposed
to being in resistance to it?

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:26:09.035 --> 00:26:10.302 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
live it, as long as I --

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:13.973 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like saying I
want to be in good shape.

00:26:13.973 --> 00:26:17.076 align:middle line:84%
In order to be in good shape
I realize what I have to do.

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:20.846 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that if I don't
I will be gaining weight very

00:26:20.846 --> 00:26:22.081 align:middle line:84%
quickly and not be
in good shape.

00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:23.349 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
what it's like.

00:26:23.349 --> 00:26:26.419 align:middle line:84%
It's there, but if I'm not
continuously working on it

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:28.287 align:middle line:84%
and managing it, and
dealing with it myself,

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:29.822 align:middle line:90%
I will bring it back up.

00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:30.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Got it.

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:31.757 align:middle line:84%
That's a great analogy,
actually.

00:26:31.757 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:90%
So -- all right, you talk

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.329 align:middle line:84%
about why would we keep
recycling negative energy.

00:26:36.329 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Why would we do that?

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.332 align:middle line:84%
If we were aware of it, say
we've gotten to this place

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.069 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and awareness
about the abandonment,

00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:45.671 align:middle line:84%
do you ask yourself that
question, why would I want

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:48.541 align:middle line:84%
to continually experience
this pain

00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.909 align:middle line:90%
of abandonment again and again.

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:51.911 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a
realization moment, right?

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:53.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:26:53.012 --> 00:26:54.914 align:middle line:84%
You say wow, I keep
repeating this behavior,

00:26:54.914 --> 00:26:56.115 align:middle line:90%
I keep creating this.

00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.617 align:middle line:84%
See the word I always use
with people is creation.

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:01.854 align:middle line:84%
You're creating it,
and people resist that.

00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:03.389 align:middle line:90%
They say why would I create --

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, yeah.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, it is.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.292 align:middle line:90%
I have had -- yeah.

00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:08.828 align:middle line:84%
It's a very hard thing to tell
someone if they're in the middle

00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:11.597 align:middle line:84%
of a car accident, and you say
well, how did you create that.

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:13.733 align:middle line:84%
That is the last thing
they want to hear.

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:15.368 align:middle line:90%
Never. Yeah.

00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:19.004 align:middle line:84%
And so -- but it's in the
long run, is something

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:21.073 align:middle line:90%
like a car accident karmic?

00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:23.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You
create a car accident.

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:25.478 align:middle line:84%
You create falling
down a flight of steps.

00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:26.612 align:middle line:90%
You create winning the lottery.

00:27:26.612 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Explain.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So my energy
is vibrating a frequency,

00:27:30.216 --> 00:27:32.418 align:middle line:84%
your energy, we're all
vibrating a frequency.

00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:35.788 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happened that -- it
was so funny because I get all

00:27:35.788 --> 00:27:37.389 align:middle line:90%
of your e-mails all the time.

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:40.192 align:middle line:84%
And I said oh, for some reason
that day I got your e-mail,

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:42.294 align:middle line:84%
said you know, I never
sent Lisa this book.

00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, just
popped into my head.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.265 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think twice, just
said, ah I'll send her a card,

00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:48.067 align:middle line:84%
your card is --
and you called me

00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:49.535 align:middle line:90%
like a week or two later.

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're here, right?

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.838 align:middle line:84%
So we're supposed to be here
now for whatever reason.

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:55.207 align:middle line:84%
So I just acted on my
feeling and just did --

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:56.509 align:middle line:90%
which I do all the time now.

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Which before I would have
said oh, I thought about it

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.412 align:middle line:84%
and then I forget, oh yeah,
whatever.

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:05.618 align:middle line:84%
So energetically, I am
always creating my life based

00:28:05.618 --> 00:28:06.585 align:middle line:90%
on my feelings.

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
So if I am feeling --

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.657 align:middle line:84%
if I'm unable to resolve a
feeling your soul says I'm going

00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
have to create an incident
for you to bring this feeling

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.128 align:middle line:90%
into your consciousness.

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:17.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, wow.

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:18.531 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:20.299 align:middle line:84%
So that you can get and
act on that feeling.

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:21.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:23.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So there's -- you
talk about the big three things

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:26.005 align:middle line:84%
that come up around
-- is it around karma?

00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:27.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I think it's
around life in general,

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:30.409 align:middle line:84%
but certainly going to be around
karma because we all share this.

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:33.012 align:middle line:84%
The energy is the
same for all of us.

00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:35.648 align:middle line:84%
We all have fear, and fear
actually is interesting,

00:28:35.648 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:84%
because fear is something that
keeps us in third dimension.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It keeps us safe.

00:28:38.951 --> 00:28:40.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And it keeps us
in third dimensional form.

00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:43.022 align:middle line:84%
If you had no fear you couldn't
be here because you'd vibrate

00:28:43.022 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
at such a high level
you'd be gone.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:45.724 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So that's one.

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.428 align:middle line:84%
Shame is another feeling we
all have, because what happened

00:28:49.428 --> 00:28:52.498 align:middle line:84%
for us as people, we
left source energy.

00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That might be new
for people hearing that,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.203 align:middle line:84%
they might think they're
the only ones with that kind

00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:58.838 align:middle line:84%
of shame, because it
only happened to you.

00:28:58.838 --> 00:29:00.139 align:middle line:84%
And I completely
understand that.

00:29:00.139 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: No, everybody.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.608 align:middle line:90%
Because we all left source.

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:05.778 align:middle line:84%
The minute we left source
energy we encounter shame.

00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:08.547 align:middle line:84%
Shame is actually
like the original sin.

00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:09.715 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of what it is.

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling
of shame is big.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.454 align:middle line:84%
And of course unworthiness or
being unloved is the last --

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:16.956 align:middle line:84%
those are the three
core feelings

00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:18.924 align:middle line:84%
and core issues that
we all work through.

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And unworthiness in
being loved or unloved?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Unloved.

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:22.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Unloved?

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You feel
unloved, you feel unworthy.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.666 align:middle line:84%
So if you didn't get love as a
child, which nobody got enough

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:30.135 align:middle line:84%
or what they needed, or
whatever the case may be.

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.203 align:middle line:90%
As humans.

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:33.639 align:middle line:84%
So that -- there's
always that feeling

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:36.575 align:middle line:90%
of I'm unlovable, I'm unworthy.

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:40.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So these are the
three major fears with people.

00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Core feelings.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Core feelings
with people.

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So how does this
relate to karma?

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So now we're here
-- if I can cycle through,

00:29:47.553 --> 00:29:51.323 align:middle line:84%
as I cycle through different
pieces of my karma I don't have

00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:53.292 align:middle line:90%
to feel shame at that level.

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.227 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to feel
fear at that level.

00:29:55.227 --> 00:29:56.262 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't feel unworthy.

00:29:56.262 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I should feel very worthy.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you're saying
if we're born with these

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:02.568 align:middle line:84%
and they're embedded in our
psyche we still are going

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:05.137 align:middle line:84%
to have them, but we're going to
know how to manage them better?

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:07.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, again, you
know, you know it's funny --

00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:11.744 align:middle line:84%
here we are in Hollywood,
here we are, in this world,

00:30:11.744 --> 00:30:14.647 align:middle line:84%
and you see and you meet these
people, as have I, these people

00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:16.215 align:middle line:90%
who are actors and celebrities.

00:30:16.215 --> 00:30:17.716 align:middle line:90%
And you think, oh, whatever.

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:20.886 align:middle line:84%
These people are the
most fearful, nervous --

00:30:20.886 --> 00:30:22.554 align:middle line:84%
not all of them, but
a lot of these people

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:23.956 align:middle line:90%
who are pretty successful --

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:27.293 align:middle line:84%
and I've met a lot of successful
business people who are nervous.

00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:28.961 align:middle line:84%
And you say why,
you're so successful

00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:30.396 align:middle line:90%
and everything is great, why?

00:30:30.396 --> 00:30:33.832 align:middle line:84%
It's something innate,
I think in all people --

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.668 align:middle line:90%
and I think part of it is good.

00:30:35.668 --> 00:30:38.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I mean, I think some of
that fear makes them successful.

00:30:38.037 --> 00:30:38.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Absolutely.

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:39.805 align:middle line:90%
I think it's good.

00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Vulnerable.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Part of it
is what makes us great.

00:30:42.141 --> 00:30:44.677 align:middle line:84%
Because I never feel like
-- wow, you're great --

00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:46.111 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm doing the best,
I'm doing everything,

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:47.313 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing what I can do.

00:30:47.313 --> 00:30:49.648 align:middle line:90%
I want to keep aware of that.

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:51.951 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny,
because years ago I went

00:30:51.951 --> 00:30:53.986 align:middle line:90%
to see a trance medium.

00:30:53.986 --> 00:30:55.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:56.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: A trance medium,
goes into a trance and connects

00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:58.257 align:middle line:84%
with these beings
from the other side.

00:30:58.257 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
There's all the stuff that
I do and then you know,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.728 align:middle line:90%
I can talk to you about it.

00:31:02.728 --> 00:31:04.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is great,
no, this is great.

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:06.899 align:middle line:84%
So you obviously went down
the medium path after that.

00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: This was another
guy that I met

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.234 align:middle line:84%
through somebody else, but yeah,
anyway,

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:11.437 align:middle line:84%
he was different because he went
into a trance and he connects

00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:13.238 align:middle line:84%
to these beings, and then
you ask him questions.

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:14.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:15.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So that was one
of my questions, I said listen,

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:18.944 align:middle line:84%
we're working with these
issues, you're doing better

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:22.281 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving in the right
direction, are they gone?

00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:25.117 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a visual
that I always remember.

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:29.121 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's kind of
like worms under the ground.

00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:33.292 align:middle line:84%
And he said they're looking
for a soft spot to pop out of.

00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:33.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So think about it.

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:36.862 align:middle line:84%
When it's cold weather, it's
hard, the ground is hard,

00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:37.896 align:middle line:90%
they can't get through.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.966 align:middle line:84%
But they're always
waiting for a spot.

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:43.902 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like him
saying those core feelings are

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:50.576 align:middle line:84%
always there, but you can now
manage them in an effective way

00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.811 align:middle line:84%
if you are vigilant with
the work on yourself.

00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:53.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:54.813 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:57.616 align:middle line:84%
Now what about desires, what
does this have to do with it?

00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:59.151 align:middle line:84%
This next slide has
to do with desires.

00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:00.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:01.954 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
desires to feel emotions,

00:32:01.954 --> 00:32:03.222 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
your soul wants to do.

00:32:03.222 --> 00:32:05.424 align:middle line:84%
Your soul wants to
feel a certain desire.

00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:06.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:08.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So now what we do
is

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:11.797 align:middle line:84%
because we resist is we
don't allow ourselves

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:13.999 align:middle line:90%
to feel that feeling.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What -- are you
talking about feelings like love

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:18.504 align:middle line:84%
or friendship or those
types of feelings?

00:32:18.504 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Generally,
we all have a desire

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.508 align:middle line:90%
to feel love and be loved.

00:32:22.508 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But your soul wants to feel
all of these negative feelings,

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.212 align:middle line:84%
abandonment, unworthiness,
whatever it is.

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:30.215 align:middle line:84%
So you have -- that's part
of your karmic process is

00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:32.418 align:middle line:84%
to say wow, I came here
to feel abandonment,

00:32:32.418 --> 00:32:35.287 align:middle line:84%
I came here to feel unworthy,
I came here to feel unloved.

00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:38.424 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
wanting to do.

00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So that comes to me as this
deeper desire to feel a feeling.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.664 align:middle line:84%
But my natural brain says, well,
you don't want to feel that.

00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:46.565 align:middle line:90%
And you resist.

00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:47.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:50.736 align:middle line:84%
Right. And that's part -- so
I want to go back to the part

00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:53.305 align:middle line:84%
of how do you break
the cycle of karma.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Okay, so let's
go through that process.

00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:56.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then I know
-- yes, I want to know how.

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:57.543 align:middle line:90%
How do you break that.

00:32:57.543 --> 00:32:59.178 align:middle line:84%
And especially when it has
to do with other people.

00:32:59.178 --> 00:33:00.813 align:middle line:84%
Like there's people in
your life that are there

00:33:00.813 --> 00:33:03.348 align:middle line:84%
for karmic reasons,
and you might

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.617 align:middle line:90%
or might not be aware of it.

00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:09.054 align:middle line:84%
How do you break that pattern so
you're not repeating that again?

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:10.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So what
happens is we first want

00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:12.091 align:middle line:90%
to address what I feel.

00:33:12.091 --> 00:33:13.959 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about --
because it's really an

00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:15.561 align:middle line:90%
emotional process.

00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:17.663 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that happens
is let's say I do something

00:33:17.663 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.766 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I don't show up.

00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You would be angry.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You'd say geez,
Joe is supposed to be here,

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.438 align:middle line:84%
and I have a whole
studio set up.

00:33:26.438 --> 00:33:28.207 align:middle line:90%
And how would you feel?

00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:30.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I waoul --
disrespected.

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:34.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So that's --
I disrespected you, right?

00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So then that
would mean your soul --

00:33:36.782 --> 00:33:38.951 align:middle line:84%
you probably first
would be angry.

00:33:38.951 --> 00:33:42.488 align:middle line:84%
So what we have is we have
the surface feeling which is

00:33:42.488 --> 00:33:45.491 align:middle line:84%
that first, I'm angry,
I'm upset, I'm something.

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:49.228 align:middle line:84%
But then underneath
would be disrespected.

00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:53.098 align:middle line:84%
So now you have to be able
to say what do I really feel.

00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you're not saying
that if you didn't show up,

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
that I killed you in a past
life and that's repeating --

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: No, no.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You're not going
down that road of karma.

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:02.341 align:middle line:84%
You're going down something
more on the emotional level?

00:34:02.341 --> 00:34:02.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yes.

00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:03.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:04.743 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:34:04.743 --> 00:34:06.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And that could have
been something that happened,

00:34:06.078 --> 00:34:07.546 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's a
whole another story,

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:09.113 align:middle line:90%
that's another show.

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But basically, let's say
you feel disrespected.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:14.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Now I would say to
somebody is this, listen, okay,

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:17.022 align:middle line:84%
so what generally happens,
and this is the trap

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
for people also, you'd
be mad at me, right?

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.961 align:middle line:84%
You'd be mad at me, you
say I'm angry at Joe

00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:26.131 align:middle line:84%
because he did not
come to the studio.

00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:29.334 align:middle line:84%
What I really should be doing
is saying how do I feel.

00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:30.736 align:middle line:90%
I feel disrespected.

00:34:30.736 --> 00:34:34.039 align:middle line:84%
Now the next question I would
ask you is who made you feel

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:35.807 align:middle line:90%
that way when you were younger.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.443 align:middle line:84%
And it's be, generally,
one of your parents.

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:39.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So you say well,

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.615 align:middle line:84%
my dad always disrespected
my opinions and what I did.

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:47.352 align:middle line:84%
And that would tell you you have
an unresolved emotional issue

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:90%
with your dad.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that's
what you call karma?

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:50.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Well, that's the --

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:53.258 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the --
that's the feeling.

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:55.294 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So the feeling

00:34:55.294 --> 00:34:56.495 align:middle line:84%
of disrespect was the
feeling you wanted to feel.

00:34:56.495 --> 00:34:59.798 align:middle line:84%
You picked a father
to disrespect you,

00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:02.901 align:middle line:84%
so you could have the experience
of being disrespected.

00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:07.539 align:middle line:84%
And then now unresolved, that
unresolved feeling would come

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:09.374 align:middle line:90%
up again for you in your life.

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:10.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can you have
the opposite experience?

00:35:10.943 --> 00:35:15.247 align:middle line:84%
So if, in your emotional
reserves where you wanted

00:35:15.247 --> 00:35:18.917 align:middle line:84%
to experience love again
because in a past life you were

00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:21.453 align:middle line:84%
abandoned and betrayed
and not loved,

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:24.289 align:middle line:84%
can you say that you came
back or choose these parents

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:25.691 align:middle line:90%
to really, truly love you?

00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:27.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You can, if
that is what you came --

00:35:27.726 --> 00:35:30.662 align:middle line:84%
if that was your order
when you came in.

00:35:30.662 --> 00:35:32.397 align:middle line:84%
Right? Did I come here
to say well now I want

00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:33.999 align:middle line:90%
to have this experience.

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:36.835 align:middle line:84%
We always -- understand, we
always did come to feel some

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:37.903 align:middle line:90%
of these bad feelings,

00:35:37.903 --> 00:35:39.805 align:middle line:84%
or we would consider
negative feelings.

00:35:39.805 --> 00:35:41.306 align:middle line:84%
They're really just
your journey.

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:44.276 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a -- you know,
somebody may pick an easier path

00:35:44.276 --> 00:35:46.411 align:middle line:84%
with loving parents this time,
say that's what I want to feel,

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.113 align:middle line:84%
I want to have this
different experience.

00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:50.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Okay, so starting
the shift and how to do this,

00:35:50.215 --> 00:35:54.419 align:middle line:84%
and you have a clear -- I like
clear slides on how to do this.

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:58.257 align:middle line:84%
So you start off by
elevating your awareness.

00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:01.393 align:middle line:84%
And then identifying
the feelings and beliefs

00:36:01.393 --> 00:36:03.662 align:middle line:84%
that are holding you
back at the core level.

00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:05.797 align:middle line:84%
So that's either fear,
shame, abandonment.

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:07.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Or in this case,
we said disrespected, right?

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.068 align:middle line:84%
That would be the feeling, I
have this feeling of disrespect.

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:11.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:12.938 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the one that
caught my eye.

00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:15.407 align:middle line:90%
Then do the opposite.

00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:17.976 align:middle line:90%
Take the opposite action.

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:19.444 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:20.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You know, it's
funny, I use this a lot

00:36:20.646 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
with people, especially
who have a lot

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.683 align:middle line:84%
of approval-seeking
issues, which we all do.

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:27.286 align:middle line:84%
Approval-seeking again is
I didn't get enough love.

00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:30.289 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, for example,
and I actually talk about this,

00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:31.657 align:middle line:84%
because that's a great
example for people

00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:33.759 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
has it on some level.

00:36:33.759 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you grew
up in a family

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.863 align:middle line:84%
where you did not receive
the love you wanted.

00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:40.565 align:middle line:84%
And the only time you got any
kind of positive feedback was

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.901 align:middle line:84%
when you did something
for everyone else.

00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, I did what
my mom wanted,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.072 align:middle line:84%
or I went to the store, or
I did this or a did that.

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:49.808 align:middle line:84%
Now what happened was
your energy field,

00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:53.979 align:middle line:84%
your belief system says well, I
get love, which it's really not,

00:36:53.979 --> 00:36:56.848 align:middle line:84%
when I do something
for someone else.

00:36:56.848 --> 00:36:59.484 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now going to go out into
the world and look to do things

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:00.686 align:middle line:84%
for everyone else,
so I can get love.

00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So I can get love.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.254 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:37:02.254 --> 00:37:03.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.222 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm in approval-seeking
energy.

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.157 align:middle line:90%
That's my energy.

00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:07.459 align:middle line:84%
My energy is now
in that vibration,

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I will keep bringing people
in who want me to do things

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.866 align:middle line:84%
for them because that's what
I am looking to do, right?

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.068 align:middle line:90%
And you keep doing it.

00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:20.472 align:middle line:84%
So now that has become a
core part of who you are.

00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:22.674 align:middle line:90%
And you think you're good

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.143 align:middle line:84%
when you do these things
for everybody else.

00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:27.145 align:middle line:84%
Now on the other side of
it, you generally get upset

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.281 align:middle line:84%
because somewhere down the
road it doesn't work out.

00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or then you
fall into that story

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:32.718 align:middle line:84%
of I'm always doing
things for everybody else,

00:37:32.718 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
how come I don't
get any support.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Now I'm a victim.

00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:36.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:37:36.555 --> 00:37:37.723 align:middle line:90%
That's the shadow side of it.

00:37:37.723 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Here's
what happens.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.725 align:middle line:90%
So now I say to you, okay,

00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:41.293 align:middle line:84%
you're an approval-seeking
person,

00:37:41.293 --> 00:37:43.195 align:middle line:84%
you have all these people
asking you for favors,

00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:44.930 align:middle line:90%
what would be the opposite?

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Me asking
them for a favor?

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, first would
be you not doing them a favor.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.202 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:37:50.202 --> 00:37:53.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Before we get to
you asking, let's first say no.

00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:54.973 align:middle line:90%
We can't jump to the asking.

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:57.142 align:middle line:90%
The asking is a little harder.

00:37:57.142 --> 00:38:00.412 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing for these
people to do would be to say no.

00:38:00.412 --> 00:38:02.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: No, I just had this
conversation with someone

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:08.954 align:middle line:84%
about me just being very
giving, just constantly giving.

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:13.458 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even in my realm
of awareness to ask for help.

00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:15.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Which is
something I have as well.

00:38:15.093 --> 00:38:18.263 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is
we want to seek balance.

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:21.299 align:middle line:84%
And balance meaning I could
ask, and I can also offer.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:24.436 align:middle line:84%
Or I can give help, but
I could also get help.

00:38:24.436 --> 00:38:26.671 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning
because you're so extremely

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.874 align:middle line:84%
in that side you
have to learn to --

00:38:28.874 --> 00:38:31.043 align:middle line:84%
almost like swing yourself
all the way to the other side

00:38:31.043 --> 00:38:32.778 align:middle line:90%
and say no to everything.

00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:33.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's true.

00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:90%
That is the initial --

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.681 align:middle line:90%
to exercise that muscle

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.817 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't been
exercised for a long time.

00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:41.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: But to deal with
the feeling of what happens,

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.221 align:middle line:84%
what happens now when you
say no, how do you feel?

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:44.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh gosh.

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.057 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of feelings come up.

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I get scared to say no,
I am fearful to say no,

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.033 align:middle line:84%
I think if I say no
they won't like me,

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:58.303 align:middle line:90%
that no is no permanently.

00:38:58.303 --> 00:38:59.304 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:38:59.304 --> 00:39:00.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: What
do you actually --

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:03.208 align:middle line:84%
think about it from --
you're going through things.

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:06.178 align:middle line:90%
But think about what you feel.

00:39:06.178 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:84%
If I say Lisa, can you do
me a favor, and you say no.

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.317 align:middle line:84%
What is the feeling
emotionally that comes

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:14.586 align:middle line:90%
through you as you say that?

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:16.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Initially, the
word anger comes up.

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:17.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Hmm.

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.926 align:middle line:84%
Because it's anger from all
of those times where I said yes

00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:22.761 align:middle line:90%
and got taken advantage of,

00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:24.463 align:middle line:84%
which isn't really being
taken advantage of,

00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:26.765 align:middle line:90%
it's allowing myself to be.

00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So you're
angry at yourself.

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:28.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:29.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So meaning
you're in self-judgment.

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:30.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Which is not good.

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And then what's the
other feeling?

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That comes
up when I say no?

00:39:33.405 --> 00:39:34.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:37.642 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing it now.

00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:39.277 align:middle line:90%
Right? You're not helping.

00:39:39.277 --> 00:39:42.614 align:middle line:84%
Which brings up a very
powerful emotion for people.

00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:45.951 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: For me it seems
like I would be missing

00:39:45.951 --> 00:39:50.755 align:middle line:84%
out on an opportunity to
either participate in something

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:51.823 align:middle line:90%
or help something out.

00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:53.058 align:middle line:90%
It feels like I missed --

00:39:53.058 --> 00:39:54.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: But that's
your rationalization, right?

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:55.894 align:middle line:90%
It's not your emotion.

00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:56.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What's the --

00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:58.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So the
common would be guilt.

00:39:58.797 --> 00:39:59.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:39:59.297 --> 00:39:59.965 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:01.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right?

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:03.101 align:middle line:84%
I feel guilty because, you know,
hey, Lisa asked me to drive her

00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.538 align:middle line:90%
to the airport and I said no.

00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:07.706 align:middle line:90%
So that shows you, right?

00:40:07.706 --> 00:40:10.175 align:middle line:84%
That you rationalize,
which is what we all do.

00:40:10.175 --> 00:40:11.076 align:middle line:90%
Rationalize it.

00:40:11.076 --> 00:40:12.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's perfect.

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:12.911 align:middle line:84%
I get to use myself
as a guinea pig.

00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:13.712 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:40:13.712 --> 00:40:14.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: It's fantastic.

00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:15.780 align:middle line:84%
This is me all day
with my own self.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is just
a therapy session,

00:40:17.182 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:90%
this really isn't a show.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.251 align:middle line:90%
It's just on camera.

00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:20.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: It's
really not a show.

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.087 align:middle line:84%
So again, think about it,
you would feel guilty, right?

00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:25.157 align:middle line:84%
If I said can you help me with
something and you said no.

00:40:25.157 --> 00:40:28.426 align:middle line:84%
And not knowing just maybe
you're just not available,

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.963 align:middle line:84%
you're not around, whatever
it is, it's a legit reason

00:40:31.963 --> 00:40:33.598 align:middle line:90%
that you're not doing it.

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:90%
But you would feel guilt.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:36.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right?

00:40:36.835 --> 00:40:39.571 align:middle line:84%
So that feeling of guilt
you have to then sit

00:40:39.571 --> 00:40:41.039 align:middle line:90%
with it and be okay with it.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:41.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:40:41.673 --> 00:40:42.974 align:middle line:90%
God, that's great.

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:43.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That's how I get
powerful to say,

00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:46.611 align:middle line:84%
I can say no, it
doesn't make me bad.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:49.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I would think of other
ways I could make up for it,

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:53.151 align:middle line:84%
or do something else
for them, I would justify it.

00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:54.419 align:middle line:90%
Right? I wouldn't sit --

00:40:54.419 --> 00:40:57.289 align:middle line:84%
you're saying sit with
that feeling of guilt?

00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And so
what you have to do,

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.725 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is, this
is how you're strengthening --

00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:02.661 align:middle line:84%
talking about strengthening
that muscle, right?

00:41:02.661 --> 00:41:05.397 align:middle line:84%
When I say no -- see, this
happened to me with my family,

00:41:05.397 --> 00:41:08.033 align:middle line:84%
because my family used
guilt to always --

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:09.434 align:middle line:90%
because Italians are very tied

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:11.937 align:middle line:84%
up in every single thing that's
happening, you have to be there.

00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:14.239 align:middle line:84%
And even if they call you,
I called you, you know,

00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:17.142 align:middle line:84%
3 o'clock in the afternoon,
and it's 5 o'clock,

00:41:17.142 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
you're not coming,
you just called me.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.215 align:middle line:84%
And I would drive myself crazy
to get there, because I knew

00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:25.750 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't go there
in my belief system

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.919 align:middle line:90%
at the time, I was bad.

00:41:27.919 --> 00:41:29.788 align:middle line:90%
I am now a bad person.

00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.656 align:middle line:90%
Because I did not go.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.392 align:middle line:84%
So as I got more powerful
and started doing this work,

00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I said I have to
start saying no,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.761 align:middle line:90%
even if I have nothing to do.

00:41:36.761 --> 00:41:38.997 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like on
principle, I have to do this.

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Say no. So now you
might feel guilty.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.668 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm getting all the
pushback from everyone

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:46.905 align:middle line:84%
because they're saying
you can't say no.

00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:48.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And --

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:49.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: But I had
to sit with the guilt

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:51.076 align:middle line:84%
and just say you know,
I have to ride this out,

00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:54.412 align:middle line:90%
and allow myself to feel guilty.

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:55.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And then what happened?

00:41:55.747 --> 00:41:57.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: As I
started feeling guilty

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:59.551 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself to feel
it, here's what happens.

00:41:59.551 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
As you allow yourself
to feel it,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.989 align:middle line:90%
you start dissolving the guilt.

00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:05.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Isn't it
amazing how that happens.

00:42:05.457 --> 00:42:06.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: So you dissolve it.

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.927 align:middle line:84%
So now as you do it
again, not as hard.

00:42:08.927 --> 00:42:09.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Do it again.

00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:10.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Do it again.

00:42:10.595 --> 00:42:11.396 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:13.231 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden you say oh,

00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:16.401 align:middle line:84%
this is about me doing
what's best for myself.

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Taking care of you.

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:20.338 align:middle line:84%
And then you defected to
California, you just moved.

00:42:20.338 --> 00:42:21.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: That,
you know, it's funny,

00:42:21.573 --> 00:42:22.941 align:middle line:84%
because we had been talking
about this for a couple

00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:24.309 align:middle line:90%
of years, and I was always --

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:26.277 align:middle line:84%
I had come out here a lot
because I was doing work

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:28.146 align:middle line:84%
out here. I was coming out here
like three, four times a year.

00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:29.614 align:middle line:84%
And then my family
came a few times.

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:33.018 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying, you know, one
day I'd like to move out here.

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:34.919 align:middle line:84%
I said just even if
we try it for a while.

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.121 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:37.422 align:middle line:84%
We just kind of started
having that conversation.

00:42:37.422 --> 00:42:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And then my son wanted
to go to school out here,

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.859 align:middle line:90%
we had kind of a reason to go.

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:42.694 align:middle line:84%
And we did it in like
a five-week period.

00:42:42.694 --> 00:42:45.563 align:middle line:84%
Part of it was for us,
karmically, for my wife --

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.532 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I have been
together for a very long time,

00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:49.567 align:middle line:84%
and my son is 20 years old,
and we've been together --

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:52.871 align:middle line:84%
married 23 years, and we have
this unbelievable healing

00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:54.973 align:middle line:84%
relationship, but
part of it was we had

00:42:54.973 --> 00:42:56.341 align:middle line:90%
to get away from that energy.

00:42:56.341 --> 00:42:59.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you realized
that as a team you had

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:00.545 align:middle line:90%
to get away from that?

00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:01.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:03.114 align:middle line:84%
And I think our higher
selves on a karmic,

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:06.518 align:middle line:84%
energetic level said you
need to remove yourself

00:43:06.518 --> 00:43:08.486 align:middle line:84%
so you can really get
your energy settled

00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:10.288 align:middle line:90%
and cleared once and for all.

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:12.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then how did
that go over with the family?

00:43:12.357 --> 00:43:14.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Well, you know, I
think we did it very quickly.

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:16.528 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like we said
hey, two years from now.

00:43:16.528 --> 00:43:19.831 align:middle line:84%
We said -- we told everybody,
we did it -- we decided quickly,

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:21.599 align:middle line:84%
and we did it within
four or five weeks.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.635 align:middle line:84%
So everybody was kind
of like -- shocked.

00:43:23.635 --> 00:43:25.704 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
was some disbelief.

00:43:25.704 --> 00:43:27.672 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
that undercurrent

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:30.542 align:middle line:90%
of you're leaving us guilt.

00:43:30.542 --> 00:43:33.344 align:middle line:84%
And you know, why are you doing
this, and what's going on.

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:34.713 align:middle line:90%
So I think part of it was --

00:43:34.713 --> 00:43:36.648 align:middle line:84%
so we definitely had to
go through those feelings

00:43:36.648 --> 00:43:38.983 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, my wife as well
because she's very connected,

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.752 align:middle line:84%
and her dad just passed
a few years earlier.

00:43:40.752 --> 00:43:43.488 align:middle line:84%
So we had all of these different
emotional issues going on.

00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:46.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you sat with them,
and you moved through them.

00:43:46.057 --> 00:43:47.158 align:middle line:90%
And now you're here?

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:48.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Now we're here.

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And this
explains the next slide.

00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:53.531 align:middle line:84%
So you're starting
with the shift.

00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:55.333 align:middle line:84%
Elevate your awareness,
we talked about this.

00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:58.369 align:middle line:84%
Taking the opposite action,
which is what you kind of did.

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:01.005 align:middle line:84%
And then now you get to
focus on what you want.

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:02.807 align:middle line:84%
All right, so tell
me about that?

00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So now -- I think
this is a critical thing for us,

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.412 align:middle line:84%
because if you say to somebody
how often during the day, are

00:44:07.412 --> 00:44:11.015 align:middle line:84%
you focusing on what you want, I
don't think many people are

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:12.717 align:middle line:84%
putting a lot of attention in
that space

00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:14.719 align:middle line:84%
to say this is really
what I want in my life,

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:90%
this is the kind of life --

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.189 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean what
you want, say, a new car.

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:19.891 align:middle line:84%
What kind of life do you want
to have, what do you want

00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:22.093 align:middle line:84%
to do every day, what
are your experiences,

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:23.762 align:middle line:84%
how do you want to
live your life?

00:44:23.762 --> 00:44:25.864 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's something
that people are not doing.

00:44:25.864 --> 00:44:29.734 align:middle line:84%
So how often do people sit there
and say yeah, what do I want.

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:30.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:44:30.435 --> 00:44:31.569 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to feel.

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:34.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And when I
do it, I feel selfish.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:36.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's not
the idea though, right?

00:44:36.941 --> 00:44:38.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: No.

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:38.943 align:middle line:84%
But that's how people
feel because they're

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:41.246 align:middle line:90%
so removed from that idea.

00:44:41.246 --> 00:44:44.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So when you moved, and
we're using this as an example,

00:44:44.249 --> 00:44:47.452 align:middle line:90%
to California, how did you feel?

00:44:47.452 --> 00:44:49.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I -- you
know, in the beginning,

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:50.989 align:middle line:90%
it was a -- it was a hard --

00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Honestly, yeah?

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: It was a difficult
beginning, because it was kind

00:44:54.259 --> 00:44:56.561 align:middle line:84%
of like, okay, we're going to up
root ourselves, move everybody,

00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:58.930 align:middle line:84%
move across the country, do
this whole dramatic thing.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.366 align:middle line:84%
We were all, you know,
my -- the three of us,

00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.868 align:middle line:84%
my wife of course grew up in
New York, we were always there.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:05.069 align:middle line:84%
Very involved with
these families,

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:07.138 align:middle line:84%
tremendously meshed
with everybody there.

00:45:07.138 --> 00:45:10.508 align:middle line:84%
So breaking that cycle, talk
about breaking the cycle, right?

00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:13.445 align:middle line:84%
That was a very dramatic,
traumatic thing to do.

00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:14.879 align:middle line:84%
So I had to emotionally
go through those --

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:17.148 align:middle line:84%
I felt guilty, I felt
like I should be there.

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:21.386 align:middle line:84%
But I had to process all of
that emotion within myself.

00:45:21.386 --> 00:45:22.487 align:middle line:90%
And it took a while.

00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:24.122 align:middle line:84%
I would say the first
year we were here,

00:45:24.122 --> 00:45:25.423 align:middle line:90%
we were only here two years,

00:45:25.423 --> 00:45:27.792 align:middle line:84%
but I would say the first
year a lot of that went on.

00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:30.862 align:middle line:84%
And I think -- my wife
actually went back many times,

00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:33.198 align:middle line:84%
I only went a couple of times,
she went back many times.

00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:35.433 align:middle line:84%
And I think little by
little she has had to work

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:37.969 align:middle line:84%
through her issues with
her family and so forth.

00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:41.773 align:middle line:84%
But it was a difficult
transition.

00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:43.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But now -- how
are you feeling now?

00:45:43.608 --> 00:45:44.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Now I feel great.

00:45:44.609 --> 00:45:45.677 align:middle line:84%
Now I feel like we've
settled into here,

00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:47.078 align:middle line:84%
my son got into the
school he wanted to,

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.479 align:middle line:84%
that was a big part
of why we came.

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:50.582 align:middle line:84%
He came here when he was still
in high school, so he did get

00:45:50.582 --> 00:45:53.284 align:middle line:84%
into that school, which is a
big validation, by the way.

00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:84%
And then I think now we've kind
of said okay, we're here,

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:58.256 align:middle line:84%
we're good, this is
where we are for now.

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.593 align:middle line:84%
Accept that you're here, I
think we're all kind of united

00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:04.229 align:middle line:84%
as a united front now, and I
think we've all settled into it.

00:46:04.229 --> 00:46:07.732 align:middle line:84%
So now things are really
starting to get better.

00:46:07.732 --> 00:46:08.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So you have shifted?

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:10.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yes.

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you made a shift
and you're able to pay attention

00:46:11.703 --> 00:46:13.137 align:middle line:84%
to the feelings that
you have now?

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:15.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And part of it is
you have to be willing to ride

00:46:15.507 --> 00:46:16.975 align:middle line:90%
out the rough part of it.

00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:18.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's a very
important part of this.

00:46:18.176 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Very
important part.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.445 align:middle line:84%
You've got to say,
well, you know what,

00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:23.948 align:middle line:84%
when I make a shift I
have to ride it out.

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:27.018 align:middle line:84%
When you start telling
people no, you're going

00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:29.354 align:middle line:90%
to get negative pushback.

00:46:29.354 --> 00:46:30.822 align:middle line:90%
You have to ride that out.

00:46:30.822 --> 00:46:33.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So as you say in
this next slide, what happens

00:46:33.258 --> 00:46:37.528 align:middle line:84%
when you shift your focus, have
other opportunities come up now

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:40.732 align:middle line:84%
as a result of you shifting your
focus, and not being focused

00:46:40.732 --> 00:46:43.301 align:middle line:84%
on the guilt but looking
at being at peace with it?

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:44.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Yeah,
not at first.

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:45.503 align:middle line:90%
It took a little while.

00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:46.838 align:middle line:84%
I kind of went through -- and
I think we go through this,

00:46:46.838 --> 00:46:48.172 align:middle line:90%
I call it a gray zone.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:51.109 align:middle line:84%
So you go through this,
like, emotional experience,

00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:52.644 align:middle line:84%
and you go through this
cleansing experience,

00:46:52.644 --> 00:46:54.412 align:middle line:90%
and then I went into a gap.

00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:57.448 align:middle line:84%
And part of the gap was I
really wanted to just be quiet.

00:46:57.448 --> 00:47:00.885 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of pulled
myself out because I needed

00:47:00.885 --> 00:47:04.522 align:middle line:84%
to get myself out of the whole
scene of what I was doing.

00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:06.791 align:middle line:84%
I actually for about six, seven
months, didn't do any classes,

00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:10.528 align:middle line:84%
didn't do any coaching, didn't
do anything, and took a break.

00:47:10.528 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And then started to do
some more corporate work.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:16.768 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm just starting to
pick up my momentum again,

00:47:16.768 --> 00:47:19.504 align:middle line:84%
and things are happening, things
are happening, we had the book

00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:22.206 align:middle line:84%
as I said in the Academy
Award gift bag last year,

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:22.941 align:middle line:90%
gifting suites.

00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:24.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Great idea.

00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:25.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So we had a couple
of things last year that started

00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:27.045 align:middle line:90%
to pick those things up.

00:47:27.045 --> 00:47:29.547 align:middle line:84%
But for a while I was
almost in a vacuum.

00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:33.318 align:middle line:84%
I need to just give myself
this time, which is something

00:47:33.318 --> 00:47:34.585 align:middle line:90%
that we also have to do.

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:35.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Which you did.

00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:36.955 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture
of you with some

00:47:36.955 --> 00:47:38.156 align:middle line:90%
of the people at the Emmy's.

00:47:38.156 --> 00:47:39.958 align:middle line:90%
That was a great idea.

00:47:39.958 --> 00:47:43.161 align:middle line:84%
So these are new opportunities
coming up for you as a result

00:47:43.161 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:90%
of living in Los Angeles.

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:45.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Yeah.

00:47:45.263 --> 00:47:46.664 align:middle line:90%
Like -- being here, right?

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:49.334 align:middle line:84%
If I wasn't out here I wouldn't
be here, and things like that.

00:47:49.334 --> 00:47:50.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's great.

00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:53.404 align:middle line:84%
Your life is a story of how
to release that type of karma.

00:47:53.404 --> 00:47:54.372 align:middle line:90%
And that's the book.

00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:55.974 align:middle line:84%
It came out a couple
of years ago.

00:47:55.974 --> 00:48:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Oops. Okay, so this whole thing
came about because of your story

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.381 align:middle line:90%
and your past and your life.

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:06.417 align:middle line:84%
What did you do about the
marketing side of all of that?

00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:08.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: You know, the
marketing side, you know,

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:11.656 align:middle line:84%
it's just kind of I guess a
branding issue to a degree.

00:48:11.656 --> 00:48:14.692 align:middle line:84%
Part of it I've kind of
now evolved out of the --

00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:17.662 align:middle line:84%
into this spiritual world,
but business as well,

00:48:17.662 --> 00:48:20.398 align:middle line:84%
so I do spiritual business work
with enlightened entrepreneurs

00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:22.133 align:middle line:90%
and people who want to do that.

00:48:22.133 --> 00:48:25.169 align:middle line:84%
Then I also still do the
straight hey, you want to work

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:26.838 align:middle line:84%
on yourself and work on
your energy and your karma.

00:48:26.838 --> 00:48:30.375 align:middle line:84%
So I've been able to blend
those two things together.

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:33.077 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like
now at this time --

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:34.779 align:middle line:84%
I was just telling
you before we started,

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:37.915 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with a company now,
and I think we really need

00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.084 align:middle line:84%
to bring this into
the corporate world.

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:43.454 align:middle line:84%
Because the corporations have a
lot of power, and they are at --

00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:47.625 align:middle line:84%
they are really not functioning
in an enlightened manner.

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:49.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do corporations
have karma?

00:48:49.394 --> 00:48:50.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: I think
corporations --

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I think everything
is a living entity.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So a business like anything else
does have a karmic signature

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.301 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or the karma
of the people

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.104 align:middle line:84%
that the collective people that
are in the group agreement.

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: The
treatment of the people,

00:49:01.406 --> 00:49:04.275 align:middle line:84%
how the people are treated,
the energy of the company.

00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:07.979 align:middle line:84%
Now as we're moving into higher
vibration the companies must

00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:10.848 align:middle line:84%
start to align with
doing the right thing

00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:12.450 align:middle line:90%
for everybody involved.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.085 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing that,
are they not doing that.

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe as we go
forward the companies

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.189 align:middle line:84%
that are not doing that,
and there are many,

00:49:18.189 --> 00:49:20.925 align:middle line:84%
are going to start -- we
already saw this happen in 2008.

00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:22.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, yes.

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:23.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: And really,

00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:27.031 align:middle line:84%
I really believe had the country
not bailed these companies

00:49:27.031 --> 00:49:29.000 align:middle line:84%
out, we would have been
much further along

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.568 align:middle line:90%
where we need to be.

00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:32.603 align:middle line:84%
And I think it actually
set us back a little bit.

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:33.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:49:33.604 --> 00:49:34.939 align:middle line:84%
It did. I was just
about to say that.

00:49:34.939 --> 00:49:38.142 align:middle line:84%
Let me sum up exactly how
you break the cycle of karma,

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:39.477 align:middle line:84%
or actually would
you sum that up.

00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:41.212 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:49:41.212 --> 00:49:44.148 align:middle line:84%
Letting go, being
aware of it, what else?

00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Ultimately,
you have to allow yourself

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:48.453 align:middle line:84%
to feel the feeling that
you've been resisting.

00:49:48.453 --> 00:49:51.923 align:middle line:84%
So if I am feeling unloved
I have to feel that.

00:49:51.923 --> 00:49:54.525 align:middle line:84%
If I'm feeling guilty,
as we talked about before

00:49:54.525 --> 00:49:57.562 align:middle line:84%
with the approval-seeking
thing, you doing me a favor

00:49:57.562 --> 00:49:58.796 align:middle line:90%
or not doing me a favor.

00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So once, as I allow myself
to feel the feeling,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.204 align:middle line:90%
the emotion dissolves.

00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:08.072 align:middle line:90%
But this is hard to do.

00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:09.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, to
be aware of it.

00:50:09.307 --> 00:50:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So say in a relationship
and a couple got a divorce,

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.680 align:middle line:84%
did they complete that
karma by getting the divorce

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.550 align:middle line:84%
or will they only do that
as they get into the feeling

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.352 align:middle line:84%
of the reason why
the divorce happened,

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:24.689 align:middle line:84%
and then they can start to
resolve and create newly.

00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.692 align:middle line:84%
So we have people who get
married multiple times,

00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:30.595 align:middle line:84%
they can't -- because they
never cleared the energy.

00:50:30.595 --> 00:50:34.065 align:middle line:84%
So if I get a divorce and it's
been an enlightening experience,

00:50:34.065 --> 00:50:38.302 align:middle line:84%
and I realize okay, this
is not what I wanted,

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:41.572 align:middle line:84%
and I went through the
emotion of that divorce,

00:50:41.572 --> 00:50:43.407 align:middle line:90%
and I understand what happened.

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:46.377 align:middle line:84%
Now I can go out and
create a better relationship

00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:48.112 align:middle line:90%
or attract the right person.

00:50:48.112 --> 00:50:49.514 align:middle line:90%
If I don't --

00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:50.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You're going
to keep creating it over

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.249 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again --

00:50:51.249 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Same exact thing.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Which is exactly
how I started the show,

00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:56.554 align:middle line:84%
by saying have you been a
pattern of your victimhood

00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:57.655 align:middle line:90%
or a pattern

00:50:57.655 --> 00:51:00.224 align:middle line:84%
of bad relationships,
or repeat patterns.

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:90%
So your sense of karma is more

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:06.697 align:middle line:84%
about the repeated emotional
patterns in your life as opposed

00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:08.332 align:middle line:90%
to specific karma with somebody.

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:09.934 align:middle line:90%
From a past life.

00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:11.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: And that
is part of it as well,

00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:14.038 align:middle line:84%
because you will bring people
into your life that you knew

00:51:14.038 --> 00:51:16.641 align:middle line:84%
from past lifetimes and
resolve relationships

00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:17.542 align:middle line:90%
with them from the past.

00:51:17.542 --> 00:51:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Those are all elements of karma.

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How would you know
that your relationships exist?

00:51:21.813 --> 00:51:23.347 align:middle line:90%
Are, like, your family members

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:26.751 align:middle line:84%
and your children automatically
people that you have karma with?

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Most people are.

00:51:28.352 --> 00:51:31.022 align:middle line:84%
Most of the families and
close people you encounter

00:51:31.022 --> 00:51:32.557 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
you've had some kind

00:51:32.557 --> 00:51:33.925 align:middle line:90%
of history with them somewhere.

00:51:33.925 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or not so close,
work relationships, bosses.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Right.

00:51:36.494 --> 00:51:37.895 align:middle line:90%
Could be anybody.

00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:39.063 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. People that you have had
some kind of experience with.

00:51:39.063 --> 00:51:40.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Let me ask
you that for a second.

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:84%
If you have a boss that you
have a lot of contention with,

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:47.138 align:middle line:84%
look at the emotion that
that contention brings up

00:51:47.138 --> 00:51:50.374 align:middle line:84%
and you're likely to find the
karmic relationship there.

00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:52.143 align:middle line:84%
Sit with the feelings
and they'll dissolve.

00:51:52.143 --> 00:51:53.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So I had a woman,
I'll give you an example

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:55.246 align:middle line:90%
because you're using a boss.

00:51:55.246 --> 00:51:57.748 align:middle line:84%
Comes to me, tells me she
has this abusive boss,

00:51:57.748 --> 00:52:00.051 align:middle line:84%
and the guy is yelling at her
to make her feel terrible, blah,

00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:02.019 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, and as
I start talking

00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:04.422 align:middle line:84%
to her all she did
was defend the boss.

00:52:04.422 --> 00:52:05.556 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's under
a lot of pressure,

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:07.091 align:middle line:90%
and this is what's going on.

00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So as we did the work and I
said what are you feeling.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.295 align:middle line:90%
Well, I feel unappreciated.

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:12.997 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like he doesn't
appreciate the work I do.

00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:14.198 align:middle line:84%
So who made you feel
unappreciated?

00:52:14.198 --> 00:52:15.299 align:middle line:90%
My father.

00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:15.866 align:middle line:90%
Who's the boss?

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:16.767 align:middle line:90%
Your father.

00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:17.568 align:middle line:90%
So what did you do?

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:19.270 align:middle line:90%
You brought your father in,

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.139 align:middle line:84%
because your father made you
feel unappreciated.

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:24.408 align:middle line:84%
You didn't process that feeling,
so you brought your boss in,

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:26.177 align:middle line:84%
and you did exactly the
same thing when I asked you

00:52:26.177 --> 00:52:28.145 align:middle line:90%
about your father, defended him.

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then
what, she realized it?

00:52:29.714 --> 00:52:31.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So she
worked through the feeling

00:52:31.249 --> 00:52:32.183 align:middle line:90%
of being unappreciated.

00:52:32.183 --> 00:52:33.651 align:middle line:90%
Now here's what happened.

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:34.685 align:middle line:90%
This was the miraculous thing.

00:52:34.685 --> 00:52:37.755 align:middle line:84%
A few months later
she said to me -- we had

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:39.757 align:middle line:84%
finished doing the work, and I
still kept in contact with her,

00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:42.226 align:middle line:84%
she said you're not going
believe what happened.

00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:44.262 align:middle line:90%
He got transferred.

00:52:44.262 --> 00:52:45.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:46.397 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:48.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: So once
she cleared the energy,

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:51.802 align:middle line:84%
her soul said you don't
need to do this anymore.

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:54.639 align:middle line:84%
So your soul will resolve it,
because your soul will say okay,

00:52:54.639 --> 00:52:56.741 align:middle line:84%
you're done, that
person will be gone

00:52:56.741 --> 00:52:58.776 align:middle line:84%
or the other person will come
in, or whatever has to happen.

00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:00.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And most likely in that

00:53:00.077 --> 00:53:02.647 align:middle line:84%
circumstance she will then
create more opportunities.

00:53:02.647 --> 00:53:05.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Nunziata: Or attract
a much better situation,

00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:07.652 align:middle line:84%
or a boss that makes
her feel appreciated

00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:10.254 align:middle line:84%
and the work she's
doing it valuable.

00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:12.356 align:middle line:84%
But it -- she didn't do
it -- she said you know,

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.125 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do anything,
but she really did,

00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:15.593 align:middle line:90%
she did it with herself.

00:53:15.593 --> 00:53:17.161 align:middle line:84%
She said I didn't do
anything with him.

00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:18.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's a great example.

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:19.664 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect example.

00:53:19.664 --> 00:53:21.966 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for enlightening us

00:53:21.966 --> 00:53:23.100 align:middle line:90%
and being with us here today.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.269 align:middle line:84%
You made something that
is complex very simple.

00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: That is my --

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.539 align:middle line:84%
that is my mission in this
lifetime is to demystify

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:30.675 align:middle line:84%
and make this -- I
always say I want

00:53:30.675 --> 00:53:32.076 align:middle line:84%
to make spirituality
user-friendly.

00:53:32.076 --> 00:53:33.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Very nice, very nice.

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:34.745 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you again.

00:53:34.745 --> 00:53:35.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Nunziata: Thank you, Lisa.

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.048 align:middle line:84%
