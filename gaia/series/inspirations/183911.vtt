00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: What if
our psyche knew our past

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and where we're
going in our future?

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
What if the answers to
our deepest questions

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
are really locked inside
our own subconscious mind?

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Wouldn't you want
to find out how

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:10%
to get access to that locked
up information, so we can heal?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Past life regressionist
Mira Kelley

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is joining us to talk about
how our fears and our phobias

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and our anxieties and
other emotional states

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
can have their origins
in past life events.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.118 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating, first of all.

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRA KELLEY: Thank you.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be an
amazing conversation.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:90%
You know it is.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
You know it is.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.323 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have had just
quite a journey in your life.

00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just roll
out of bed and say,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a past
life regressionist today.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
You really had a journey,
and it's such a great story

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's great for everyone
to hear because it unveils how

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:90%
we find our destiny in life.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us a little
bit about how you got started?

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I would love to.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:10%
I came into the world
of past life regression

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:10%
you could say by chance,
if anything's ever

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:10%
a coincidence, right?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And the moment I learned about
past lives, it clicked in.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It really felt so right, so
familiar, or so comfortable.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And the very first time
I read a book on it,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:90%
it was very intriguing.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
But I was way too
young, way too little.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of put
that on the backburner.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How old were you?

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I was 13 years old.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And you imagine.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:90%
You have a teenager.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You know how it is.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Other things seem more
interesting and fascinating.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:90%
The world is a big place.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I was much
older years later.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling with
a physical challenge.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I had a very painful
jaw condition

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
that left me with severe intense
pain, always right here, right?

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know that even when
you have the smallest scratch,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:90%
it bothers you.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.313 align:middle line:90%
You notice it.

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And now when I drink
something, that's, like, always

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:90%
right here in your face.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.974 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, jaw pains.

00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:19.774 align:middle line:90%
Intense, yes.

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Now were you in-- where
were you living at the time?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.365 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Mm, I was at that
time living in New York City.

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I had a very demanding
career as an attorney.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I was a corporate
attorney, so imagine--

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --lots of
responsibilities,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:90%
lots of hours of work.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your origin
is from Bulgaria, yes?

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, yes.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Originally, I'm from Bulgaria.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And so there I am,
working as an attorney

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:90%
and developed this condition.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't know what to do.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I went the traditional route
of working with many people

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
out there who are trying
to manipulate the tissue.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was looking within
and helping me guide within.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so after a whole year of
trying to figure things out

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and nothing working,
I was told that I need

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
to have a very painful surgery.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they described
to me that they

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
were going to break my jaw.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine this?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, oh, oh.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And then reattach
my jaw back with wires,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
hoping that that
will actually soothe

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.538 align:middle line:84%
the inflammation and the pain
in the muscles of the jaw

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:25.996 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where the issue was.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That seems barbaric.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Totally.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Totally.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.202 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That doesn't
seem like a good idea.

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I couldn't do it, right?

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And so in that moment of
me saying, what do I do?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I need help here.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I got to do something else.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the past life
regression I did as a kid.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And reading all those stories
of how people would just

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
miraculously heal just
by experiencing something

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
in their head, right?

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I saw myself as a man who
was very strong physically,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
but his spirit was broken
because he was a slave.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big metal collar

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that was always hurting right
where the pain was in mirror

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:90%
in my body in this life.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I experienced
the intense powerlessness,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
the intense feeling
of I'm a slave.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in charge of my
own life and my destiny.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this question of
power and powerlessness

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
was very strongly playing
emotionally in my awareness.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up the next morning
after experiencing this,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and the pain was gone.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Incredible, right?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now were you in that
time in your life feeling like

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:90%
you were enslaved--

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --to your
job and your work?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And I didn't
have the awareness

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:90%
to connect the two, right?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely felt
that way at my job, right?

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:90%
The demands being placed on me.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, and prior
to that, prior to you

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
moving from Bulgaria
to New York City,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
was there any story of
that going on in your life,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
where you felt enslaved to
maybe your parents' will

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
or a different will than yours?

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Not so
much, but then again,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
it was a communist
country I grew up in.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot that
was different, right?

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.975 align:middle line:90%
Let's use that word-- different.

00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Strongly different.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that question was
really working itself

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:90%
in the back of my psyche.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to
be free and powerful?

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is a question so many
of us work through, right?

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Even with our finances,
even with our relationships.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be the
regime, the political regime.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's personally,
within ourselves.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
happens with everyone when

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:90%
they do a past life regression.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They always connect
with a lifetime

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that is there to guide them
to understand, to heal.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And I really love that
you made the connection

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
with where I was
personally, Mira,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
when I did that regression
and had that physical issue.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And as that worked
itself through me, right,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.893 align:middle line:84%
as they worked through
those emotions, it was gone.

00:06:03.893 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wish it was
that easy, though.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it just as a matter
of simply becoming aware,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
or were you really ready for
something to unlock in you?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I'm not going
to tell you that it's

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:90%
100% with every client.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
For some, it's
right there, right?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Immediately, instantly.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The phobias, the
fears, the issues.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's like, oh,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
now I understand, and
now I have to apply.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to learn
everything that I

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%
learned in this experience.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I actually have to screw my
head in the right direction

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.455 align:middle line:84%
and think differently
and use my willpower.

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's really beautiful
to show that example of how

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
it really can directly relate
to healing in your life,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
especially when someone might
not understand or believe

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in, because of a
religious belief,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:90%
past lives and reincarnation.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
What or how do you
explain that to people

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:90%
who don't believe in that?

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Oh, so the
answer is very simple--

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're open, as long
as you're just saying let's

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
see if there's something to
this that can benefit me.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot of people
who simply come and say you

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:90%
know what?

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if this is real.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.215 align:middle line:84%
I had these background
religious understandings

00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that, hm, don't quite fit--

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so they're
open in the first place.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --but I'm
willing to try, right?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I ask of people.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Because the process works.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
You have been other
times and places, right?

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Even anybody who has ever
raised more than one kid

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or even the one kid will tell
you they come their own people.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They do not come
blank slates, right?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
They have their
preferences, their desires.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that
is us having been

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
in other times, other
places, and showing up

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:90%
with a different understanding.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
a great example

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
because our daughter came in
with this incredible passion

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
for horses and this
seamless connection

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:90%
with the beautiful animal.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I've never been around horses.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
She was never around
horses as a baby,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
but she migrated towards
them out of the womb.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And it would be really
interesting to see

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
with her connection,
which is so interesting.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Because now she's kind
of broken that connection

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
'cause she got into
being a teenager,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's a point where you're
a teenager where either you

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
go into teenage years
or you stay riding.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it would be interesting
to see if that would help

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:90%
her reconnect with the animals.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:33.985 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Most certainly.

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just
the love of the animals.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
else there, too, right?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So we always are most strongly
connected with lifetimes

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
where there's some
learning, some shared theme.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
A theme is a better word
than a lesson, right?

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Something that we are
here to because there

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%
is no judgment to it.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.552 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I call
it a nagging, though.

00:08:54.552 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really a pulling.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is insatiably curious,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
you're curious about, but it
can't be solved or satisfied.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And for anyone
who's experiencing

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:84%
this weird, strange phenomenon
of really being drawn

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
towards something that
you don't understand why,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
this is a great way
to explore that.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, absolutely.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that's the case
with me, so go figure.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's such a simple,
silly example.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Yet I have a very strong
connection with Japan

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and with a Japanese
lifetime I have lived.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Now did I grow up with
the Japanese cuisine?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But you're drawn towards
it, which is a good example.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So then you went on to become
a past life regressionist

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:90%
for many years now, right?

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, gosh.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It feels like I'm on
a whole different time

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
trajectory, right?

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
That lifetime of being me an
attorney feels like a past life

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was a significant
jump, but this jump

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
was informed by my
own healing, right?

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And then this pool,
this nagging pool

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that you called
it, right, this has

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to talk to other
people because it's a passion.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to share what's possible.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to tell people it
could be so easily resolved.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's give this
a try, and people

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
will have these
extraordinary experiences.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I found myself
working with Dr. Wayne Dyer,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and he was immediately
the way for me

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect with so
many people because he

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:84%
has this big powerful
voice that will bring

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:90%
incredible stories to people.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.915 align:middle line:90%
And so I had the opportunity--

00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:34.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --to really dive
into a whole different way

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.517 align:middle line:84%
of serving the world
very authentically.

00:10:40.517 --> 00:10:42.642 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to talk
about that in a second,

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
but do you think that
that for you was karma?

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Was it destiny?

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a past life that
maybe was a pulpit on a stage?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Have you looked into that?

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It's the
desire to uplift.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really the desire to heal.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was definitely
a strong connection

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:90%
with Wayne Dyer, right?

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.522 align:middle line:90%
I dreamt of-- him and I work--

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I never told you this story--

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --so now
let's say it on camera.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: So here's the story.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years
before I even met him,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream that
he was teaching me

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:90%
how to be a spiritual teacher.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Not how to forgive, how
to be compassionate--

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
the core of his work--

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
but him and I were
working on I'm

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
going to teach you
how to be somebody

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:90%
who can change the world.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --I didn't know,
and Dr. Dyer, I didn't

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.365 align:middle line:90%
have a way of knowing him.

00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And then when him
and I connected,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.335 align:middle line:90%
it was like, oh, I'm home.

00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:38.135 align:middle line:90%
Welcome home.

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you wrote him a
letter that said I'd love

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to do--

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and he talks about this.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.667 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Simply because I
had a moment of intuition

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
that maybe I can help, right?

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And then I resisted it.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I was like, no, no,
no, I'm a lawyer.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided if there
is a way to serve, why not?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
we connected, and it

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
was a very powerful
healing experience for him.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So him and I worked
on his leukemia.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
when he transitioned,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the autopsy showed that there
was no leukemia in his body.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the bringing
of divine love

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:90%
was the path of healing for him.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.225 align:middle line:84%
And I feel so blessed that I was
instrumental in that for him.

00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%

incredible story.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but it was such a
beautifully written letter.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So I invited her to come.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a total life
changing experience.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.877 align:middle line:84%
And if Mira, if
you could come up.

00:13:58.877 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:90%
This is Mira Kelley.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.692 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I seldom had any firsthand
experience with past life

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Then I met Mira, Mira Kelley.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I had no expectations
for our session,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
but within an hour
of her arrival,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I entered into one of the
most riveting experiences

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of hypnotic time
traveling imaginable.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
remarkable experiences

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Truly a life transforming,
life shifting experience.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born and grew up
in a communist country.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Growing up for me,
there was no religion.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:90%
There was no spirituality.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
There was no god.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
There was no talks about
angels or reincarnation.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I was 13 years old when the
very first mention of it

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
came into my life through
a book by Brian Weiss.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I loved the possibilities of
people instantly changing.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a corporate
and securities attorney

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in a large law firm in New York
City when a regression again

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
powerfully came
back into my life.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
A very simple dental procedure
created an extreme TMJ

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:90%
condition in my jaw.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even open my mouth
to put a fork or spoon for food

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It was really extreme.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Speaking, sleeping, standing
was a great challenge

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
because the pain is right
here, always in your face.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
You cannot ignore it.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And after a whole year of
attempting to heal myself,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I did a past life regression.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw a very brief,
very vague visual of me

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:84%
as a slave, a very
strong, tall black man.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a slave, I had
a big metal collar

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
right here around my neck.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And the metal collar
had this imperfection.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And when it was put
together, that it was always

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:90%
rubbing right there in my jaw.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I left this woman's
office, and all

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I could do for the rest of
the day is basically cry.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I was just having such
a cathartic experience

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of releasing emotions.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
why I cried, you know?

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
It just felt very
emotional to me.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I woke
up and the pain was gone.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It was all gone.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
After I had this
powerful healing

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
through connecting
with my past lives,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I became very much
a spirit undercover.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And with time, I began
regressing others.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I was able to
work with Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:10%
Him including the story of our
regression, the full transcript

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:10%
of the story, his book
"Wishes Fulfilled,"

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and also sharing with his
audiences about his experience

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:10%
with me gave me an
instant credibility,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:10%
an instant authority.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It gave me access to a
really large audience that

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
is very much attuned to
this kind of information

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and to this kind of work.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.120 align:middle line:84%
My life has never been
the same since then.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was great
to see Wayne again.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
I always love hearing his words.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was, as you
know, my mentor as well,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
and did the same thing with
me, took me under his wing

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and really poured that
love and respect into me

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:90%
that I was hiding in myself.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And he has a way of doing that.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:84%
And he helped write the
foreword to my book.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have this connection with
our friend, who is very strong

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:90%
still on this planet.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I believe-- there's so
many things to talk about.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when somebody
passes, the more people that

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
hold their consciousness in
their memory, the more alive

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:90%
that spirit and soul exists.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And can really
live in our hearts

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And we keep that
consciousness alive

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:84%
because that's ultimately
what we are, right?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:90%
We're ultimately consciousness.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've slowed down into
this existence for now.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So with that said,
do you believe

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can have simultaneous
existences of reality?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that you
can be in this lifetime

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
now and then simultaneously
exist in the other

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:90%
and maybe in a future one?

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:10%
That's actually the core of
what I teach people in my book

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:10%
"Beyond Past Lives."

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:10%
And I came into learning about
this simply because of a client

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:10%
who shared with me six
lifetimes all happening

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:10%
in the same 120,
130 year period.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And imagine I came
into this session

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
with this person with the
traditional understanding

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:90%
that there is one soul.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It goes into one lifetime, then
the next, then the next, then

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:90%
the next.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
man who is saying,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, I am being
born in one lifetime

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
before I die in another.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And my mind was blown away.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine I literally
had the moment of,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.352 align:middle line:90%
like, how is this possible?

00:18:57.352 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: And so I came to--

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and that was the beginning.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning because
afterwards, many more people

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
showed up with
similar experiences.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So I can share this with
people, this understanding

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that just as quantum physicists
tell us, time is simultaneous.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And just as spiritual teachers
tell us, it's all now.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what that means
in terms of reincarnation

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is that all our lifetimes
are happening now.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And even though we talk
about them as past, present,

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and future, they're
unfolding right now,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:90%
have unfolded, and can unfold.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
regression becomes

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
really much like that mind
bending awareness that quantum

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:90%
physics presents, right?

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
thinking, wait a minute,

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
so I'm actually really seeing
only one possible version

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
of that lifetime, depending on
exactly what I need right now.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if that lifetime is
still unfolding and is ongoing,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:84%
then that means that
there are millions

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:90%
of other possibilities.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.847 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is how it's
relevant to our lives

00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
now because as we
evolve in our lives,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
we experience different
parts of ourselves.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We awaken to different
parts of ourselves.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So when I had a
reading with you,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.463 align:middle line:84%
I had seen specific lifetimes,
which I will tell you--

00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you remember this,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
but I specifically went
into a future life.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.177 align:middle line:90%
It was so amazing.

00:20:29.177 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which was amazing.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We'll talk
about that in a second

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's possible
not only to go backwards,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:90%
but to go forward.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So as you are developing
and evolving as a soul--

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I've hit a
different area in my life

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
now where I'm learning a
different soul lesson--

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
can I go back into the
past life regression

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and learn from that how
to get the tools to handle

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.175 align:middle line:90%
my new level of evolvement?

00:20:52.175 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So regression is not something
you do once and say, OK--

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.787 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --this is who
I was in my past life.

00:20:57.787 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It really is a tool for
development, for evolvement,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.707 align:middle line:90%
I really love how you said it.

00:21:03.707 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.585 align:middle line:90%
Like therapy, in a way.

00:21:05.585 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, it is.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your own
personal guided--

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.177 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you guide
someone through this path,

00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
you're really walking in very
delicate areas in their minds.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So they have to be very,
very safe with you.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And when they start
on this journey,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.080 align:middle line:84%
just give us an idea
of how safe it is.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.185 align:middle line:84%
You just ask someone to go
into looking to their feet.

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Can you share that with us?

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.185 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:21:28.185 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's so interesting you said
feeling safe because I hear

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:90%
this very often from clients.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They show up and they say, I've
been looking to do a past life

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:90%
regression with somebody.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And yet, you make me feel safe.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And so after all these
years, I trust you.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is a process that is very
gentle, very beautiful, very

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:90%
easy.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Much like meditation, it's
simply allowing for the mind

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
to focus in a specific direction
and let everything else go,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:90%
So using the power of focus.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I guide
people in a way that

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
allows them to understand
the questions, the challenges

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:84%
they have right now, so that
they feel guided right now, so

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that they feel that the
path forward is clear,

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
so they feel empowered--

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that sense of I get it and
I know exactly what to do.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So you take them into a deep
relaxation, a deep state.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you say look
down at your feet.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And then some
people are very visual,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.255 align:middle line:84%
so they immediately see
and describe to the level

00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:34.055 align:middle line:90%
of detail--

00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:35.013 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where they are.

00:22:35.013 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --that is absolutely
extraordinary to listen.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And for other people, it's
the rest of their senses--

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
smell, touch, awareness,
simple knowingness.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of our senses come
into place and then people

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:90%
start building in the scene--

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
in other words, one piece
after another after another.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And they become aware of
what they look like, right?

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the environment, who
are the people around them.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Very often, they
recognize people

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
they share their present
life with, the places

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and experiences in terms of
periods and time in history.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it all
becomes such a vivid,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
such an exciting
adventure of getting

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to know more of yourself,
more of the soul journey.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And as people
learn that, as they

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.072 align:middle line:84%
come to experience
those deep emotions--

00:23:31.072 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
it feels, right?

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel scary, even
if it's an unfortunate story--

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: --a painful story.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It feels emotional, but
it's not the kind of emotion

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that is when you go to watch a
horror movie that kind of shuts

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:90%
you down-- scary for no reason.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of
experience that opens you

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
up, allows you to
forgive, gives you

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
a greater level of awareness.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%
So truly, truly life changing.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How is it
not scary, though,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.707 align:middle line:84%
if you're going into a
lifetime where maybe you were

00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:90%
burned at the stake or hung?

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:84%
In your situation, how is it
not scary to go back into that?

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I
experienced a lifetime

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
where I immediately dropped into
the body of this other woman.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So I look at myself, and
I look very different.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running
down this hallway,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and I can see the brick walls.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
open doors to escape,

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm aware that there's
people behind me, chasing me.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aware in this
moment, and my heart

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
went from complete
relaxation, right?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Imagine completely calm
to beating super fast

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and me being so
anxious and tense.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have the awareness
that I'm being chased

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:90%
by officers from the Nazi army.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
doing, these soldiers,

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
is they're looking to catch
me because I have put a poison

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:90%
in somebody's glass of water.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So rather than giving
them a medication,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I had actually poisoned them.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I get to
this room, and I see

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
how there's a little sliver at
one of the doors that opens.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I get into this room, and
I see that there's just

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:84%
a little sliver of a window,
and there is no escape.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And the next scene I see is
myself looking from above,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:90%
and I'm on an electric chair.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm about to be executed.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And I am aware that--

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.302 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You say
this with a smile.

00:25:21.302 --> 00:25:22.885 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And I'm
feeling goosebumps--

00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:23.042 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:23.042 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: --at the same time.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, I really
experienced this, right?

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I'm aware
that this man I have actually

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
killed was done with
for the greater good.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what I believe
I was doing, right?

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I was a Soviet Union spy,
and I was really there,

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
serving as a doctor who was
really picking up information,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the instructions
I have been given is to--

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
what a horrible word--
terminate this man, right?

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:90%
This general.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And so as my soul was leave--

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because I'm looking
from above, right?

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing this below.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not feeling the
pain of the experience.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm seeing the
beauty of the experience

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.710 align:middle line:84%
because I see my
soul lifting, and I'm

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:90%
aware that the lesson was love.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Just really deeply connect,
and love, and honor,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and have compassion.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And my soul was lifted and a
spirit guide came and got me.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And the two of us continue--
well, the two of us

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
continued while a
part of my awareness

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
is here still watching, right?

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there was such an
experience of I get it.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I get it.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So even though there
was the emotion of fear,

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
there was so much healing and
understanding and compassion.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So I came out of this
not judging myself,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:84%
but really loving myself
more and having compassion

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
for others more and such a clear
understanding that I'm here

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:90%
to love, right?

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple theme,
such a simple lesson.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's such
a great example.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Quite hard.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and
that's a great example

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:84%
of showing how you can
disassociate from it,

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't feel
the pain of the moment.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, never.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You get the lesson.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be great if we
could do that in our own life

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:84%
as we're going through
the pain of a moment,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.858 align:middle line:84%
jump up to the
ceiling, and say, oh,

00:27:08.858 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
that's why you're
going through that.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.592 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be OK.

00:27:11.592 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: That's right.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:90%
We have this, right?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But just
because I'm so curious,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:84%
how did that manifest
in your life now?

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Are you executing people and--

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No, no, not really.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But I am helping with
everybody beating themselves up

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
in their struggles
and their challenges.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm there to hold their
hand and be like, you

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:90%
are an amazing person.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:10%
Look at the bigness
of who you are.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Look at your mission.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:10%
Look at your light.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:10%
You're here to be loved
and love yourself.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:10%
And just focus on using
your mind in a more

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:10%
productive and clear way.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And life will show up for you
to support you and love you

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
in a way that the divine
loves you and supports you.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.202 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you regress yourself,
or can people do this

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%
by just listening to an audio?

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to invite everybody
watching to just get

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
one of my audios, work with me.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
You can do it on your own.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.005 align:middle line:84%
That's how I regressed
myself the very first time.

00:28:05.005 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you did
that, oh, yourself.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, that's amazing.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
open to it, not closed,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
but just have a way to start the
conversation within yourself.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And be willing
to explore, right?

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, pick an
environment that's quiet.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.325 align:middle line:84%
And from there on, it's all
going to show up for you.

00:28:23.325 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So would
you suggest this

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who's going
through an illness

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
or going through a very
rough relationship?

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest issue
that people come to you with?

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So just
because I shared

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
a story that was
emotional in this way,

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that
that will be the story

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:90%
everybody will experience.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is
saying, oh, I don't know.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see myself
being executed in a painful way.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be the case.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if somebody
is saying this,

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
chances are they're
going to experience

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
a very loving, a very
peaceful, beautiful lifetime.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when you experience
a happy lifetime,

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:84%
there's so much to learn
from that as well, right?

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
encourage people to--

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
anything that's going
on in their life,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it's any illness,
whether it's phobias they

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.270 align:middle line:90%
don't even understand, right?

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they
cannot be cured.

00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --relationship
challenges, money issues,

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:90%
anything, anything.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.847 align:middle line:84%
I do have an unexplained
phobia about spiders.

00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:22.647 align:middle line:90%
It--

00:29:22.647 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Still?

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tried everything.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:90%
I've tried hypnosis.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:90%
I've tried everything.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I should--

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.703 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And we
have to work on this.

00:29:28.703 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.853 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, here's a question.

00:29:30.853 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So what if-- so here's
a great example.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
My producer of the
Aware show, Gina, she

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
had these incredible past
lives in Cairo, in Egypt.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And she's traveled there,
and she got married there.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And her makeup and her
look looks like Cleopatra.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And she really embodies
this Egyptian lifetime

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Yet, she's not in Egypt.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:84%
She's not traveling
there right now.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
She's not there.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
What happens when-- is she
off of her soul's calling

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to go to Egypt, or
is she really needing

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:90%
to use that in her life?

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.971 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happens if you
don't act on what you find?

00:30:08.971 --> 00:30:10.346 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not
convenient for her

00:30:10.346 --> 00:30:13.563 align:middle line:84%
to go to Egypt right now because
she's producing this show.

00:30:13.563 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So that's
the connection

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
with a lifetime where
there was a shared

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:90%
theme, a shared lesson.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
coming through so strong

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's such an importance
for her to pay attention,

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
going to Egypt.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not about living there.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not about marrying
an Egyptian man.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really about understanding
I have this passion,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:84%
but behind this passion,
there is something.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Because I'm
here in this lifetime.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a different person.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I chose a different
location, a different family.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
recreating that lifetime.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about discovering
what is the topic, what is

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:90%
the theme, what is the lesson.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe who is Cleopatra,
what does she represent,

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.113 align:middle line:84%
and how can Gina embody
that in this lifetime.

00:31:00.113 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I like that.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are you listening?

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, do you
know a lot about history?

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.583 align:middle line:84%
Do you know a lot about the
time periods and so forth?

00:31:10.583 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Have you had to learn?

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I am
learning from clients,

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm learning the details
that are actually exciting.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
we've been talking only

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:90%
about past lives.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But this process is just as
good about exploring the future

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:84%
because like we were saying, the
future is happening right now.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I love the
possibilities of the future

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that I hear from clients, right?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Exciting stuff.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing--
you've worked

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:84%
with a child who had this
experience of being Lou Gehrig.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, gosh.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It was really wonderful
working with Christian.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So Christian experienced
early lifetime,

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
around three years old, four,
he started sharing with his mom

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:84%
these stories of being
Lou Gehrig and also about

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Babe Ruth--

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:84%
just little comments
here and there.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And she would take
notes, and she

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
would be really perplexed
what's going on.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And so she came to see me.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
She came to one of
my workshops, and she

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.080 align:middle line:84%
said this is what's
going on in my life.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you come and work
with me, with my family?

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And so sure enough,
I worked with her.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
She and I did a past
life regression.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.500 align:middle line:84%
She experienced being
Lou Gehrig's mom.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
She experienced
level of details that

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
is not in the public domain.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like she
went and researched them.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I also worked with Christian.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
what's so interesting

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about karma.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So as you know, Lou Gehrig died
from the Lou Gehrig disease,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:90%
which is a muscle disease.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So back then, there were
no breathing machines,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:90%
no breathing apparatuses.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So the muscle weakness
affected him in a way

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't breathe.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's how he transitioned.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
lifetime, Christian

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
came in with severe
asthma where to the point,

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:84%
they would be in the emergency
room practically every week,

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:84%
With the kid having
severe asthma attacks.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Him and I did a past
life regression,

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and here's what I told him.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, this is
a different lifetime.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to continue
with the same symptoms.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:90%
This is a different body.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a healthy
and strong body.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:90%
You can let that go.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Just like that, the
symptoms were gone and so--

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: During the
regression or after?

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Till this day.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I think Christian is now, if
I'm not mistaken, 10 years old.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: But the
symptoms haven't returned.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very grateful
for Cathy Byrd.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:10%
His mom now has went on to
write a book, "The Boy Who

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.530 align:middle line:10%
Knew Too Much,"
acknowledging the role I

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.620 align:middle line:10%
played in Christian's
healing because to a mom,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:10%
this is a huge--

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:10%
to him, this is a huge deal.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's the karma that
we're speaking of, right?

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not about staying
with what's coming up.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's about understanding
it and using it.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them
definitely have

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.925 align:middle line:84%
the mission of bringing the idea
of reincarnation to everybody.

00:34:08.925 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is phenomenal.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: People who
like baseball, right?

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
People who would
never talk to you

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%

interested in the baseball

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's fascinating.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:18.447 align:middle line:90%
That is so fascinating.

00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Her book is great, and now,
what details did she remember?

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they've
reincarnated together.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.177 align:middle line:84%
Do we come together as
a soul, group again?

00:34:27.177 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So I want to
share with you this.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.429 align:middle line:84%
She has given me permission
to speak about this.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So she experienced for her own
because that was the question

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:90%
she had, why me, right?

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Why this story,
because I'm not here

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to make money off my child.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to mess up
our private little world

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and expose this to the world.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so she
experienced a lifetime

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:84%
where she was the
daughter of a priest,

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and this man had a version
of the scriptures that

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
was in Latin that spoke of
reincarnation, which was not

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in the official Bible that he
was teaching from the pulpit.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he taught his
daughter to read at a time

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.160 align:middle line:90%
when nobody was reading.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So she would read
these scriptures.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she would
share them with her friends,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and she felt so
compelled to tell others.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And the word got out,
and the inquisition came.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And so her dad was forced to
basically sentence her to death

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and denounce what
she was teaching,

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%
saying that's what she's
saying is not right.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So she was executed, and she
came out of this experience,

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:84%
saying, oh, I understand
why this is also my mission.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And Christian and I
have come together

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to really create
this pact together

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to bring this message that
reincarnation is real.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You are here to continue
the journey of your soul,

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:90%
the growth and the development.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does that
make the judgment any easier,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
though, for he,
as a 10-year-old,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:90%
going into his teenage years?

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be interesting.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
How does that make
that journey any easier

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
for he and his mother to have
a book out about all of this?

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Now she has
an answer of why me.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's a personal
journey, much like the way

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
inspiring the world
and bringing light

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:90%
to feels like, this is me.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:90%
This is authentic.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I can stand behind
this message now.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.537 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it makes sense.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:27.385 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so now she is
understanding this is about me.

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:28.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It does
make a lot of sense.

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Right?

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When, in
my future journey,

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
where I saw the future
life, which isn't common,

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:84%
but it happens, I
saw this world that

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
was connected by all of
these pods, basically.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the air,
and it was connected

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:90%
through these white pods.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And we lived in these giant
communities of giant pods

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that were connected
to each other.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But everyone in these
pods had the same level

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the
same morality, the same--

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and the desire to help
and heal the world,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:90%
or the world that we lived in.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
pods would connect,

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was this really
fascinating existence.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have
Earth in it, though,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.040 align:middle line:90%
as we know it with dirt.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.685 align:middle line:84%
And but it was a beautiful way
of communing with each other,

00:37:19.685 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
or being in community
with each other,

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and connected and moving
the world forward.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a--

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:84%
if I look at what
I do and sometimes

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:84%
being in conscious media
is at the forefront

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of people's minds, and
having these conversations

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:90%
aren't mainstream.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.755 align:middle line:90%
Yet, they're getting there.

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:90%
They probably are by now.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But I see that vision,
and I see what's possible.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And it keeps me going.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Right?

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Right?

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that energy
is within you,

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%

with every word you

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:84%
This was a man who, in his
lifetime, in that lifetime,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.060 align:middle line:84%
had lost not only his fortune in
the crash of the stock market,

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
but his wife, gotten
estranged with his daughter.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:90%
His son died in a car accident.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So the sense of
loneliness, the sense

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:84%
of loss, the sense of everything
I have is being taken away

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.660 align:middle line:84%
from me really
brought him to a place

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.940 align:middle line:84%
where he used the gun
and committed suicide.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so as the client
was observing,

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
same thing much
like what I shared--

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Observing.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: He was observing
from above the spirit leaving

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
the body, and he
saw people hearing

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.990 align:middle line:90%
the gunshot and people rushing.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so as everything
was continuing,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.610 align:middle line:84%
he went on to say
goodbye to his daughter.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And she felt that twinge in
her heart of my dad, right?

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So as he left these
scenes, he then

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.520 align:middle line:90%
connected with his spirit guide.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit guide said to
him, you ended it too soon.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You didn't allow for the
completion of the lesson.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And now here's what's
so interesting.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there was a
scoreboard of somebody judging

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.810 align:middle line:90%
humans, saying, oh, you failed.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do well.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.030 align:middle line:84%
What happened is
he said to himself,

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:90%
he said, ah, I fell short.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I got to go do it again.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And so sure enough, he
went into another lifetime.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.310 align:middle line:84%
In such detail, he described
how lifetimes are chosen,

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.860 align:middle line:84%
how the name came up,
the family came up.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But there he is,
another lifetime.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, the man
kept his life very simple,

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't really connect with
others, died alone in a nursing

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.010 align:middle line:90%
home, didn't really--

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
connection wasn't there.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:90%
But he--

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.497 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he
didn't get it again.

00:43:00.497 --> 00:43:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Stuck it to the end.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So there he dies, and again,
he meets with his spirit guide

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit guide says to
him, you kept it very vanilla,

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.600 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:84%
At least you stayed
till the end, right?

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So then it was the
continuation of the learning

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.640 align:middle line:84%
of creating
relationships and dealing

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:84%
with emotional issues
and loss and all of that.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:90%
But at least, he didn't die.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't speak to this
issue of suicide, right?

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Because people say,
I have free will.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere in my
own world I feel

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:84%
powerless to direct
my life, right?

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:39.020 align:middle line:84%
That's where suicide brings
us into, a place of I

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:84%
feel a complete sense
of powerlessness.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.025 align:middle line:84%
But at least they have
a free will to end it.

00:43:44.025 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to tell
you, first of all,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.370 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual point of view,
you're not ending anything.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll come right back
into a similar lifetime

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
where the issue
will be the same.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So please stick it out.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.290 align:middle line:90%
It will change, or ask for help.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who will help you.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even past life
regression could help.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Anything-- reach out to me.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.815 align:middle line:90%
Reach out to anybody, really.

00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm here for you, because I
also know on the receiving

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:84%
end of being with somebody
who you dearly love

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and who is suicidal,
what that feels like.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you, you
are loved and cared for.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And you will be breaking
people's hearts when you die,

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:84%
even though you
feel they'll be OK.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
No, not true because
in this lifetime,

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability to
impact people in a way

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't be
able in another lifetime.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So right now is your
moment of power,

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.470 align:middle line:84%
even though it doesn't
feel that way, right?

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Right now is your moment
when you can actually make

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:90%
everybody else's life better.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Inspire people, impact people
in ways that you probably

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.920 align:middle line:90%
don't even recognize, right?

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we are like
pieces of the puzzle.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:90%
We all fit.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:90%
We all serve one another.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We're always there
for one another.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So if suicide is on
your mind, email me.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Work with me.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I will do everything
possible to support you.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And don't do it.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
not the answer.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.808 align:middle line:84%
And then it doesn't
resolve anything.

00:45:15.808 --> 00:45:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for saying that
and offering that to people.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You mention many times
about spirit guides.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Do we meet and do we have
these guides in this lifetime?

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it a fantasy of
what our spirit guides?

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Mm.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I think spirit guides as
that supportive energy

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
personified towards us.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So they can be people
who have passed on.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They can be spiritual beings
who are on a level of awareness

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing creation where
all they want to do is guide

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and serve.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And so each one of
us has those guides.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:90%
And a part of my work--

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I always guide people to
connect with their guides.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it's extraordinary
that once you tap in and once

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to keep
that channel open,

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.860 align:middle line:90%
you can always connect.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You can always feel that
guidance and assistance.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.232 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:46:12.232 --> 00:46:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's really the thinking
that we're alone

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that shuts things down for us
and allows for the experience

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.840 align:middle line:90%
of being alone.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's not true.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.348 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can they come
in different forms?

00:46:20.348 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're really connected
to the animal community?

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh yes.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.218 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They can come
in different forms?

00:46:25.218 --> 00:46:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Animal guides, spirit
guides in terms

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of what we think of people,
it could be other dimensions

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I love when people
connect with their guides.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they get to say,
oh, I have personal support

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.290 align:middle line:90%
group, right?

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, my own team
that is here for me.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about having a
past life on other planets

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in other realms?

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like I saw that future.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Does it always have
to be on Earth?

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No, not at all.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.862 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or this history--

00:46:59.862 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: No, not at
all people experience

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.790 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes as extraterrestrials--
other dimensions,

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.400 align:middle line:84%
other planets where, much
like what you describe,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:90%
it's not our human experience.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:90%
So gosh.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Because think about it.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:17.950 align:middle line:84%
The soul is not limited to
where it needs to go and learn.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.690 align:middle line:90%
The soul is multi-dimensional.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So you truly have
the opportunity

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:84%
to connect with any experience
that will serve you right now.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have more
belief in other existence

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of different realities
and different planets

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.968 align:middle line:84%
and so forth after
regressing people?

00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen or heard things--

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.468 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I have to tell you.

00:47:40.468 --> 00:47:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel like every day I'm on the
cutting edge of consciousness.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm an explorer
into the new territories

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the stories I
hear, they never repeat.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's so unique with
such extraordinary journeys.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So I truly feel like
I'm learning every day.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.080 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
realms, just curious,

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard of?

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I want to tell you a
story of how souls get created.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had the opportunity to
work with an amazing woman--

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Serena Dyer-- and she
experienced a lifetime

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
where she was the
keeper of a soul plane

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:22.550 align:middle line:84%
where souls will
come on their way

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:90%
to being incarnated on Earth.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they
would get their personality.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Because each one is so
different and every lifetime we

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.660 align:middle line:84%
come with a different
personality.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And so she was saying that some
of the souls who come to her

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:90%
are newly created souls.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And they come through
this portal, if you will.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, well, can
we go through this portal

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.680 align:middle line:90%
but backwards?

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she
was like, of course.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And there we are.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And she described
to me that souls

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
get created through the
combination of light and energy

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and intention, really intention.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
well, how does

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:84%
this intention of creating a
new soul comes about, right?

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, all
that is and its growth

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and its development
and its creation

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of experiences all
of a sudden has

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:90%
a desire for a new experience.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's recognizing

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.880 align:middle line:90%
that it's not all that is.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's some of what it could be.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there is a
need for something, right?

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:30.400 align:middle line:84%
A need for more, and
that more is you.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.240 align:middle line:90%
That more is me.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:90%
That more is our viewers.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this intention, this
desire for new life is created.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this, and I was
thinking to myself, gosh,

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell this
story to everybody.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Because each one of us is
loved and wanted and valued

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:84%
before we're even seen
and created, right?

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet here we are telling
ourselves these sad stories

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:90%
of I'm not enough.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or I came from this
background or that way of life.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Or my mother did this.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I don't
have what it takes.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, what am
I here to serve?

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just small
little me, right?

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet the divine
is like, it's you.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.100 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, you then who.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I created you with so much love,
with so many gifts and talents.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.712 align:middle line:90%
Go be, right?

00:50:17.712 --> 00:50:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So interesting.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a great story because--

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
what I got from that was that we
come in really with the missing

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:84%
piece that we're
looking to solve or find

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:34.090 align:middle line:84%
or desire or go after with that
experience or if it's love.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:38.300 align:middle line:84%
We come in with the
piece we're looking for.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And our whole life is
searching for that.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.658 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Isn't that funny?

00:50:41.658 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is so
amazing, because that's

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:44.830 align:middle line:90%
what your purposes.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what that infinite
looking for your purpose

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And 5,000 books
were written about--

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.220 align:middle line:84%
it's purpose, and it's because
we're looking for something.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.037 align:middle line:84%
Can you find your soul's
purpose within reincarnation?

00:50:58.037 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: You were asking me
earlier what's the question

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:01.540 align:middle line:90%
people come with the most.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And that is the question.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.280 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And we all come in, like
you said, with this purpose,

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:90%
with this awareness.

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so past life regression
is an amazing way

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.460 align:middle line:90%
to see what is your purpose.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.427 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have an
awareness of it,

00:51:20.427 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:84%
what are the challenges
that are coming out?

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The fear--

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: You know, exactly.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.887 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just
about discovering,

00:51:25.887 --> 00:51:28.250 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm going to do
this thing in my life.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It is the path of
growth and development.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And because you're not done--
you're always growing--

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:84%
your challenges, your
greatest learning,

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.155 align:middle line:84%
will come through the
medium of your purpose.

00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Does that what makes sense?

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see why a
guide is important.

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if I went
through these past lives,

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.330 align:middle line:90%
you can connect a theme.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So you go to multiple lifetimes
in this regression process,

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, yes.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And so my goal always as I guide
people is to connect the theme,

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.520 align:middle line:84%
to give the answers,
to connect the dots.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I am not
in the experience,

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:90%
even though sometimes I am.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is I see and feel

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and experience what
people go through?

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But I have the ability
to stand from the outside

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.287 align:middle line:84%
and simply see the process
and know how to guide them--

00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:19.745 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right You're
more detached.

00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're not
enrolled in the conversation

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
as we tend to be enrolled
in the conversation.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, how does our
expectations, our goals,

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe-- have you
ever had anyone who

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.860 align:middle line:84%
has a certain
trajectory in their life

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.215 align:middle line:84%
yet their lifetimes show a
completely different path?

00:52:37.215 --> 00:52:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And isn't that
most of us, though, right?

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Because when we find ourselves--

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:84%
when we find
ourselves in a place

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.250 align:middle line:84%
where my health
is breaking down,

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I am not in loving
relationships,

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm struggling with money,
what is my career, what's

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:90%
my purpose, that is us, right?

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We're off track.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:84%
We're not listening
to the guidance within

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and so that's where
working and seeing

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.300 align:middle line:84%
the bigger picture of
your soul's journey--

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.720 align:middle line:84%
clearing those blocks,
seeing the way forward--

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.640 align:middle line:90%
is so freeing.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
say, OK, I get it.

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Now my conscious
mind is on board.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I felt the emotions.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I know what to do.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have you been able
to extrapolate these themes of,

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.050 align:middle line:90%
what is money?

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:90%
What is love?

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.860 align:middle line:90%
What is parenting?

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever really
put that together?

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And it
all comes down to--

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.570 align:middle line:84%
well, obviously, it's just a
place for us to learn and grow.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, for some of
us, the challenges are money,

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.830 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And and we talk about
this as karma, right?

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I keep on dating the same
person or marrying them, right?

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I keep on having health issues.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I keep on struggling from
one financial difficulty

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we talk
about in terms of karma.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to give people
an understanding that whatever

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that theme is, whatever
that challenge is,

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:06.840 align:middle line:84%
whatever that karma is, it's
simply a field for development.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not punishment.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not you somehow
needing to pay for something

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.390 align:middle line:84%
you've done five
lifetimes ago because--

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not?

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to--

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy we're
talking about this

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.410 align:middle line:84%
so I can clear the judgment for
people and the sense of guilt

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:90%
we impose on ourselves, right?

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Because have you noticed
that only good people worry

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.245 align:middle line:90%
that they're not good people?

00:54:31.245 --> 00:54:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:33.156 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:33.156 --> 00:54:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't see the people
that are really doing evil

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:90%
in the world worrying about it.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so
this idea of karma--

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:84%
there's so much emotion and
misunderstanding around this.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And I really want people
to start thinking of karma

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.920 align:middle line:84%
as an opportunity
for development,

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.250 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for
using gifts and talents,

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for using
our willpower and directing

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.140 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts and
emotions in a productive,

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:06.180 align:middle line:84%
creative way versus destructive
pity, self-defeating ways--

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.050 align:middle line:84%
ways that allow for spiritual
growth and development.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So karma is nothing but an
opportunity for development

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.260 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to, I need
to repay something.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
time is simultaneous.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if these lifetimes
are happening simultaneously,

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:26.310 align:middle line:84%
how could I be paying for a
lifetime that happened and is

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.710 align:middle line:90%
happening right now?

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so what you do is
you discover the karma through

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.540 align:middle line:84%
the past life in the form of
a lesson and consciously give

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:90%
the opportunity to--

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.410 align:middle line:84%
now do people remember
their regression.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, always.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do?

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Just like you.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
actively involved.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.623 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: There's no way
you can forget it, right?

00:55:45.623 --> 00:55:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You forgot what you ate
two years ago for breakfast

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.300 align:middle line:90%
on today's date.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.100 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:84%
What we experience will
always stay with you?

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is true.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's very-- I clearly
remember the white pods.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:84%
That one specifically--
I don't so much

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.910 align:middle line:90%
remember the other ones.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe because I was--

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.730 align:middle line:90%
maybe got those lessons.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So if I went back in
now, I would see--

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.050 align:middle line:84%
into the regression-- I would
see maybe a different set

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of lifetimes that are
revealing themselves to me.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Because you're in
a different place in life.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:20.250 align:middle line:84%
You are looking for
a different learning.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.082 align:middle line:90%
Your energy has upgraded.

00:56:22.082 --> 00:56:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it that way.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.540 align:middle line:84%
But how do we know
it's not imagination?

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Because it
feels so real, right?

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And so for some of
these lifetimes--

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:84%
much like with Christian's
story and Cathy Byrd's story--

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:90%
you go and research.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.220 align:middle line:90%
For others, there's no research.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you go and
find some village in Africa?

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no even
records for that.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet, for the places where
there's research to be done,

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:84%
there is amazing
cases out there.

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
For others, we just
go by how we feel.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And also there's
the general proof

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of the footwear of the time,
the way people used to live.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we can
always use that as well.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But regression is a
very deeply healing

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.400 align:middle line:84%
an intimate and
personal experience.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much
about entertaining people

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.840 align:middle line:84%
with dinner stories
and tell them listen,

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I was this famous
person in history

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and this would explain
the mess in my life.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's more about shifting
emotionally and giving

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:27.330 align:middle line:84%
ourselves permission to grow and
be the best we can possibly be.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what we're
all here to do really,

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:35.370 align:middle line:84%
to use our gifts and talents in
a way that serves and in a way

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.823 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to experience
life to the fullest.

00:57:37.823 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm so
glad you said that.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not about proving
that there's a past life

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.830 align:middle line:84%
or proving the lifetime and
the existence and so forth.

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's interesting.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But it really is
about the healing

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that occurs as a
result of the journey

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:84%
that you go through in your
mind and your subconscious mind

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and what you gain from
it in your lifetime

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.800 align:middle line:84%
now, what you can do to use it
to heal your life for others

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.110 align:middle line:84%
or find your purpose or
why you got off track.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
main point of this.

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And do I care if the slave
that I was if I was in Cuba

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.690 align:middle line:90%
or in South Carolina, you know--

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it really matter?

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I don't care.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I was so grateful my jaw healed,
you know, without an operation

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and internally that I
so shifted and changed.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.740 align:middle line:90%
That's all that really matters.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just simply by feeling
that you were that enslaved?

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so that's
really what I see so often

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.260 align:middle line:90%
with people, with my clients.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Phobias releasing,
physical ailments healing,

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.340 align:middle line:84%
people really dropping
things and saying, I'm done.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And the body reflecting
that immediately, right?

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.403 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The work with children
is amazing with Jim Tucker

00:58:47.403 --> 00:58:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that he's doing at the
University of Virginia.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.910 align:middle line:90%
That's just incredible.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:53.725 align:middle line:84%
Now have you ever noticed that
people have physical wounds

00:58:53.725 --> 00:58:55.725 align:middle line:84%
from-- and this is something
that he discovered,

00:58:55.725 --> 00:58:57.450 align:middle line:90%
why I'm bringing it up?

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you had that
personal experience

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.900 align:middle line:84%
where somebody had a physical
wound from a past life?

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.317 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Isn't
that extraordinary

00:59:02.317 --> 00:59:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that people have some kind of a
mark on their skin or something

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that connects them
with that lifetime?

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so again, it's
really the understanding

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is a strong
cross-connection, right?

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:19.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a strong energy
connection with this lifetime

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.870 align:middle line:84%
simply because it's the
continuation, if you will,

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:24.790 align:middle line:84%
even though-- you know,
it's a linear word--

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:90%
of the learning.

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Because think of it this way.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.880 align:middle line:90%
So imagine a circle.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that
there is a question

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.880 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the circle.

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And let's call it
the question of love.

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so a soul would want to
learn all aspects of love.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But you don't learn
love just by being

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in an amazingly supportive,
loving relationship, right?

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So you also learn about
love by being abandoned

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.690 align:middle line:84%
in an orphanage,
by you abandoning,

00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:56.310 align:middle line:84%
by needing to take care of
parents who are getting older,

00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:58.530 align:middle line:84%
by needing to raise
a baby-- you know,

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you understand the
level of love there--

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but the love for your country,
the love for a mission.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So all these differents
are different aspects

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:09.780 align:middle line:90%
of the question of love.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And each one gives a
different perspective

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
towards the common
theme of love.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we all connect
with these lifetimes that

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:21.270 align:middle line:84%
are most significant
to this common theme

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.830 align:middle line:90%
that we're working on.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach a
level of clearing--

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.280 align:middle line:90%
the ego releases and changes--

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and we reach a place of,
I'm done with this theme,

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
we start working
on something else.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:37.805 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we connect
with other lifetimes, right?

01:00:37.805 --> 01:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When we're
ready to, yes.

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.013 align:middle line:90%
When we're ready to.

01:00:40.013 --> 01:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed that there's
a formula here for maybe

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
how to live a
purposeful life or how

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to go through
finding your purpose?

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.945 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

01:00:49.945 --> 01:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It's a
beautiful formula, yes.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Do what excites you.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's directly related
to our gifts, to our talents,

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to those things that are
innately yours, that we

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
so easily discredit because
we think, oh, it's just me.

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:08.970 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So do that because it
comes innately to you.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Follow it to the best of
your abilities, right?

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And then do it without
any expectation of where

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
that needs to take you.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
That's really a simple,
three-step formula.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Do what excites you.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Do it to the best
of your abilities.

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And do it without expecting
where that needs to take you.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how you are that
piece of the puzzle that fits,

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that serves, that contributes,
and that also allows

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.950 align:middle line:90%
you to fulfill you, right?

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you
found that people--

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:44.033 align:middle line:84%
when they go through
these lifetimes--

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that they ultimately have a
purpose in every lifetime?

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Is there any such thing
as a purposeless life?

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.450 align:middle line:90%
No, right?

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Because there is consciousness.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.170 align:middle line:90%
There is meaning.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
There is a desire for growth.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it shows
up as the purpose, right?

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So that desire for growth is
the intention for this lifetime

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that we set up right
before the life.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense, right?

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't come
into an existence

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
for no reason as a soul.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.880 align:middle line:90%
We do want to evolve.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen that over
and over and over again.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And through
our evolution,

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
everything else
evolves as well, right?

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:25.650 align:middle line:84%
The divine evokes
through us as well.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have couples
come in together or business

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
partners or--

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Working with
couples is so fun.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I go-- I
had the opportunity

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
to work with five sisters,
with their husbands,

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
and with their children.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I spend a lot of
time with each one of them.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And so guess what?

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Over time, as we started
working all the connections

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.780 align:middle line:90%
started showing up.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And then in one of
the regressions,

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.030 align:middle line:84%
somebody asked towards
the end, why you?

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
How are we connected to you?

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly we're
all connected to you.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this person
experienced the lifetime

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
where we were all
in the same village.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was the medicine
woman of the village.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And they would all come to me.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously,
imagine five sisters.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.190 align:middle line:90%
There are stories.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.720 align:middle line:90%
There are disagreements.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is intense
love because they all

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
live close to each other.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I would be the medicine
woman they all come to.

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And we'll make peace,
and we'll resolve things.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So much the same way, they
contributed in my understanding

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime so that I
can share the connections

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that people have through
different lifetimes.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.847 align:middle line:84%
And I helped them smooth
a few things again.

01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
You've come through
a couple times now

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.580 align:middle line:90%
as a medicine person or a--

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
do we have any connection with
being in medicine or anything

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
like that?

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I don't.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But you know, soul
healing is healing.

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And isn't all illness
actually a reflection

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.160 align:middle line:90%
of an emotional block, right?

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like my
work really allows

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
people to align and be the
best they can in every level.

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's fascinating
what you do.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
you opening our minds

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to something that has so
much validity and purpose

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.500 align:middle line:90%
orientation in our lives.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.530 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Thank you.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:21.827 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
reason you do what you do?

01:04:21.827 --> 01:04:23.328 align:middle line:90%
What is your biggest why?

01:04:23.328 --> 01:04:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: What a good question.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%


01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
love for the person.

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's so different than
what most people say

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
because most people talk
about humanity and changing

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.270 align:middle line:90%
the world--

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.070 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's, I fall in
love with people every day.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.700 align:middle line:10%
And when I see a person, I
see the beauty of their soul.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.040 align:middle line:10%
I see how
extraordinary they are.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.280 align:middle line:10%
I see their potential.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.340 align:middle line:10%
I see where they
cut themselves short

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.600 align:middle line:10%
and trip on their own mental
blocks and definitions

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.590 align:middle line:10%
they've put.

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.660 align:middle line:10%
And my desire is
to empower them.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.230 align:middle line:10%
My desire is to see them the
be the greatest they can.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.440 align:middle line:10%
So that's my why--

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.710 align:middle line:10%
literally one person
at a time, making

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:07.830 align:middle line:10%
the world a better place.

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully in love with people.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.183 align:middle line:84%
I share that with you, really
truly in love with people.

01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And to see them get out of
pain, to see that they have

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.740 align:middle line:84%
a different choice, and a
different way of being--

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.050 align:middle line:84%
no matter what has
happened in their life--

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that there are all these
amazing opportunities

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to change and grow and
live your best life.

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And then seeing people
actually apply all of this

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
into their life and coming
back and saying to me,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
this is how everything
is different--

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: My life is fulfilled.

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, wonderful.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing all of this with us.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
sharing this time with me.
