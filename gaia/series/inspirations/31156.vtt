00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:18.486 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations"
and our beautiful Los Angeles

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.592 align:middle line:90%
studio.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
How would it feel to
walk through your life

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:90%
without any fear or worry?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Does it seem impossible to you?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you knew that
fear and worry are the biggest

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
things that causes stress,
breakdowns, fits of anger

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and rage, and
self-defeating behavior?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So now is it more
appealing to learn

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like to
walk through your life

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
without fear or worry?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Guiding us through this
journey is Guy Finley.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of "The
Secret of Letting Go" and 40

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
other books and
audio programs that

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
have led thousands of people to
walk through life fearlessly.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.416 align:middle line:90%
>> GUY FINLEY: Thank you.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:04.915 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So really can walk
through life without any fear

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:90%
or worry, really?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: You can walk through
this life using any fear that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you have to help you realize
a part of yourself that has

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.414 align:middle line:90%
always been fearless.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: How do you do that?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.464 align:middle line:84%
So using the fear you have
to learn how to be fearless?

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: The way
things are now,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
when we get frightened of
something, some bad news,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
something comes along, basically
there's an instantaneous

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
reaction, some resistance
to the event or the person,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever seems to
be threatening us.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment we're
looking at our life

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:90%
through the eyes of fear.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
How will I ever be
free of something

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
if I actually take
on its identity?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
to us, Lisa, literally.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is that we are
anticipating and probably

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:90%
living in the future constantly.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: A lot of it is
based on a very important idea,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and that is that no
psychological fear exists

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
without negative imagination.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
No psychological fear exists
without negative imagination.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in my office.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
The phone rings, whatever it is.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Boy, somebody drops the
bomb, whatever it may be.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
In that moment my mind is no
longer in the present moment.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It's painting a picture for
me of what all this means.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the same mind that
paints the picture of what

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
all this means doesn't
know it's doing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that, because it looks at
the picture it painted,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and it goes, oh my
god, look at that.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And now you begin
to do what fear

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
tells you to do to
be free of fear.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't ask a shark to
take you out of the water.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Why would I turn
to a negative state

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and ask it, how do I get free of
this stress, anxiety, or worry?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.181 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it's a
self-perpetuating mind game,

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.388 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: It is.

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I call it the circle of
self in which there's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
an innate initial
resistance to a moment.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The minute the
resistance appears,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
now I feel as though
something has come along.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important idea.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Can I fear something unless
I believe that what I fear

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:90%
is greater than I am?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.856 align:middle line:84%
Would I fear something if
I knew that I was greater

00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:90%
than the thing?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So when
we're filled with fear,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that reaction is instantaneously
saying I am inadequate

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.717 align:middle line:90%
to the moment.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Absolutely.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And no one is
inadequate to the moment,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
because every moment,
including the fearful ones,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
are intended to help us remember
a part of us that can turn

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the straw of fear into the
gold of self-possession,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
literally to be in charge of
ourselves understanding this

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Self-possession, that's
what you're talking about.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.706 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How to take
control back over ourselves.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Actually, it's
not take control back.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's a great point.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
When we're afraid,
would you agree

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that the first thing our minds
do is they start scrambling?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for
a way to reconcile

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the problem, including coming
up with I need a better job,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.374 align:middle line:84%
I need a better set
of six pack abs,

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I need forty abs,
whatever it is--

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.831 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Living conditions,
whatever it is, yeah.

00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And I'm
looking for powers.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
What I talk about
is showing people

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't powers
that you need.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop
agreeing to be powerless.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole pursuit
of finding some power

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to deal with fear means
that I believe that who I am

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:90%
is somehow in jeopardy.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.473 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wait.

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
How are a better job
and a six pack powers?

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.035 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Because
always you have a fear,

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and it attributes itself
to the loss of something.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If you examine it, you can't
have psychological fear

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
without thinking something
is being taken from me.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: True.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.359 align:middle line:84%
So the fear is
anticipating something

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:90%
is not going to be there.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So fear basically
causes a false sense of ourself

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:90%
to be threatened.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow that
false sense of ourself

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
that is threatened by
the event-- because, see,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
the event comes
along, and I believe

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that unless you,
they, this, that,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
unless that's all right in
order, I'm not who I think I

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
am.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Something rocks my world,
it's rocking my identity.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this very
unconscious nature

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:90%
then tells me what to do.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And all it's really doing is
strengthening its hold on me,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:84%
not creating a condition
where I won't be fearless.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Because think about it, Lisa.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
How many times in your life,
I know in my own, people

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
you know they set
out, and they're

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
going to finally get all
this thing nailed down.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be afraid anymore,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
going to get rid of the drugs,
alcohol, whatever it is.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And we never get there,
because the nature that

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.789 align:middle line:84%
has told us what to do about
the fear is the cause of it.

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's what you'd
said at the beginning.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of the
Oingo Boingo song

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
"There Nothing to Fear But
Fear Itself," which I love.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.986 align:middle line:84%
You were a musician and had
a very interesting childhood.

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Grew up in Los
Angeles here, your hometown.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.622 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Right here in
Beverly Hills, actually.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.163 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How does
it feel to be back?

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Oh, boy.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: A lot of
memories, right?

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.406 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:06:16.406 --> 00:06:19.987 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So your father was one
of the first late night talk

00:06:19.987 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
show hosts on television, right?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: My father,
god bless his soul,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
in the very early '50s was
the progenitor of late night

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:90%
television talk shows.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Before Johnny Carson, Jack
Parr, all that business,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%
he introduced the variety show.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
He introduced Ella Fitzgerald,
Lionel Hampton, Desi Arnaz.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
All these people he
brought onto television

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
for the first time early '50s.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Marilyn Monroe.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a picture
here with he and Marilyn.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
He was inducted into
the Hall of Fame.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Video
Hall of Fame, yeah.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Video Hall of Fame.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.151 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Actually,
it was "Time Magazine"

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Man of the Year.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Also as well.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.816 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now what was that
environment like for you?

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to writing
about fear based on that?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I think it's because
even at a very young age--

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
the picture of my
father with Marilyn,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I rode in her lap in the
Hollywood Christmas parade when

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
my father was the
honorary sheriff.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I
could barely breathe

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%
because of the smell of alcohol.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the green room with
all of these celebrities,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
that's who I ran
with growing up.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
scrambling for position.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And there was tension,
unbelievable tension.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
A kid doesn't know what
to do with all that.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But inwardly,
spiritually, innately,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:90%
you know something's not right.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
How can this be the sum of
things, the true glitterati,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and yet everybody's grabbing
to establish a position?

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense as a child.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose it just
moved me on as a young boy

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and into my later life
wanting to understand

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.766 align:middle line:90%
the contradiction.

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you saw that in the
lives of everybody around you,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
who were in this great
place of stardom and fame,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
but inside you were seeing
that they were just wrecked.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: There
were no exceptions.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was going to say, I
don't want to couple everyone

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:90%
into that, really.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: No, I
met no exceptions.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.846 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful little
story, when I first

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
wrote "The Secret
of Letting Go,"

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in the late '80s.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Robert Young-- remember
"Father Knows Best"?--

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
he had called me and
said, I love this book.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Will you have dinner with me?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.568 align:middle line:90%
And I said, of course I will.

00:08:18.568 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I went out with
Robert and his wife Betty.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We had a marvelous
dinner in Ojai.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And you know what he told me?

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
My whole life, he
said, I kept thinking

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I was going to walk
onto the studio floor

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and somebody was going
to finally say and know

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:90%
what I knew.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They were going to point at
you and say, he's a fake.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So many
people think that, yes.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.182 align:middle line:90%
It's not only me.

00:08:44.182 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So now
you know you're--

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.162 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's good to know.

00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --in
good company, right?

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: When I was exploring
that fear within myself,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I found how many other people--
that's a very common fear.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're going
to find me out.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.757 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
there to find out.

00:08:57.757 --> 00:08:58.256 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:58.256 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Well, the thing is,
look, you have a natural gift.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Young, beautiful,
wonderful man, great actor.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But when you believe
that you are what you do

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and that your worth
as an individual

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
depends upon the appreciation
of the world around you,

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
then you are always
going to be afraid.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And you will feel
fake, because you

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to try to
maintain and protect

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
something that was a gift
to you to begin with.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Well, what I figured
out is that I don't always have

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to be perfect.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I am not always perfect.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of who I am.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It's
part of what we are.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We're created to be
continually discovering

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that who we have
been no longer works.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.947 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And that's
what fear and anxiety,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
all those negative states are
the indication that I have

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
brought something forward
with me into this moment.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.506 align:middle line:84%
Now in life we say the event
produces the negative state.

00:10:02.506 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I say the event
reveals the negative state

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that's always been
there waiting,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's
connected to a demand.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
how you attract it?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Can I get upset
with anything unless,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm aware of it or not,
something in me meets it with

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:90%
a demand?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you get negative
without a demand?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: It's impossible.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.565 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:10:22.565 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So the moment
didn't create the demand.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The demand was woven
into me over time

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
through conditioned
relationships

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:90%
to believe this is who I am.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The event comes along, which
is completely fresh and new.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It comes and it
meets this demand,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and I go, not on your life.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who-- in fact,
that's right in the news.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.932 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who
you're talking to.

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.764 align:middle line:90%
No, that's true.

00:10:43.764 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
That happened to
me the other day.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.721 align:middle line:84%
Someone called me, and they were
really upset about something

00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:90%
they thought someone did to me.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And I had no problem with it.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was shocking to them
that it wouldn't bother me.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It bothered them
because of something

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that maybe was
projected in their life.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Didn't bother me at all.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Good.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it's just one
of those things, though,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
if there was something that
someone called me about,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that did light me up,
yes, it's my fear.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a bounce?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.552 align:middle line:84%
My fear projects
onto that thing,

00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and it projects back into me?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: We wouldn't have
these fears, as it were.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the root
causes of them, which

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
can be-- look, all
of our unhappiness

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
basically exists because we
are unaware in the moment

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're truly
conscious, you're

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:90%
not going to hurt yourself.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.814 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to hurt
another human being.

00:11:31.814 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that
if I had my druthers,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to hurt myself,
I'm not going to someone else?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So if I do hurt
myself or someone else,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that means that the me that
has the druthers isn't there.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Something else is
present for me.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
That nature, Lisa, has
all of these beliefs.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
root cause of fear.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The belief that unless
people approve of me

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any value.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:84%
The belief that I'm
responsible for your happiness.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:90%
They just go on and on.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The belief that unless
people respect me the way

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I demand they respect
me then there's

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with them.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So every time life runs into
one of these very inculcated

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
beliefs, boom.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Now I only know
to do what resists

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
what seems to be threatening me.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's not me.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a false belief
that it threatens.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
don't need powers.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop agreeing to
be powerless in identifying

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.136 align:middle line:90%
with these false beliefs.

00:12:32.136 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is that what you
experienced when you were

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
growing up with the
celebrity sons and daughters

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, even the
celebrities themselves,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.304 align:middle line:84%
is that they had a
basic insecurity?

00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just the
people you knew?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.833 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: And more.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:45.625 align:middle line:90%
There are stories.

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
If we had to eight
hours, we could just

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.752 align:middle line:84%
have a knock-down,
drag-out time.

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It'd be great.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It
would, wouldn't it?

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
More times in my life-- When
we first signed with-- You

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
remember Wolfman Jack?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
remember Wolfman Jack.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
He used to broadcast
on KPFK out of Tijuana.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
He had a recording studio,
Diamond Jim Productions,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and we were signed
there by the guy that

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
produced the Iron Butterfly.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks after we signed,
we can't get the studio

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:90%
on the phone.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Our manager goes down.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
He comes back.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
He says, I got bad
news for you guys.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.987 align:middle line:84%
The Mexican government
nationalized KPFK radio.

00:13:25.987 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any money.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:90%
The studio's closing down.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.526 align:middle line:84%
And I remember getting
sick to my stomach.

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
something's wrong here.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
How can something the
Mexican government does

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.975 align:middle line:90%
make me sick to my stomach?

00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:90%
My life wasn't my life.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We are not meant to live
in the world of everything

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and everyone producing
negative reactions in us.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.866 align:middle line:84%
If I believe that who I am
depends upon someone else

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
or doing something
according to the way

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.255 align:middle line:84%
I've got it nailed down, I'm
going to live in fear, Lisa.

00:13:58.255 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's what
causes the stress,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.713 align:middle line:84%
anxiety that you were
talking about earlier.

00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it absolutely does.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, you wrote "The Secret
of Letting Go" in the '80s,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
you said?

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.868 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Let's take
a look at this.

00:14:07.868 --> 00:14:11.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a video
clip of the book.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.984 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: A fearless life isn't
a life in which a person just

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
walks through what happens
with no concern or care

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:90%
for what's taking place.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
A fearless life is a
life that understands

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that everything
that's taking place

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
has a purpose that serves
something greater than whatever

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
reaction a person is
having to the event.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the
most beautiful moments

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever
had in your life,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it was
because you happened

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
outside someplace and
everything was still

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and the light was hitting
the leaves and the grass

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and the trees, all of the
things that it was in such

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
a special way that you were
held there rapt in attention,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
or you were with another
person, and it was very

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
special because you were
sharing in a moment,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter which kind
of event you talk about.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you bring fear into
it, it ruins everything.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
You would never invite
into your house someone

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
who walks through the front
door and then throws trash

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, steals
your silverware,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and as he leaves
torches the place.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when we
invite fear into our lives,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
only we don't know that we
invite it into our life.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if we did,
we would never

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
agree to develop a
relationship with what

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
ruins all of our relationships.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Fear spoils whatever
it touches, especially

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.935 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to relationships
between two human beings.

00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:16.335 align:middle line:84%
What you experience in any
given moment for how good it

00:16:16.335 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
is, how bad it is, how
encouraging or frightening

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
it is, the character
of every moment

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.215 align:middle line:84%
is determined by our
understanding of the moment.

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So that fearlessness is a
relationship that comes out

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of an individual recognizing
that at every given moment,

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
he or she is being given exactly
what they need to discover

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
the truth about themselves
and the life they have.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
The real fearless
life is understanding

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that I'm being given, at this
very moment that I'm speaking,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
everything I need to see
and understand myself

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:84%
so thoroughly that
instead of being used

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
by the events around me,
I'm able to become one

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
with the events around me
and find therein a life that

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have fear in it,
because I'm not outside a life

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
to be fearless through.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that was taped at
the Foundation for Fearless

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:90%
Living.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.283 align:middle line:90%
What created the foundation?

00:17:27.283 --> 00:17:29.866 align:middle line:84%
Why did you decide to create a
foundation around fearlessness?

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I suppose some
time in the late '70s it was.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Having expired, basically,
my music career-- I

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
had actually a very
successful music career.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I wrote motion picture
music, television scores.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.129 align:middle line:84%
I wrote for Diana Ross,
Billy Preston, Jackson 5.

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.753 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: My partner and I, we
were the first white soft rock

00:17:54.753 --> 00:17:55.895 align:middle line:90%
artists at Motown Records.

00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: At Motown.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But it began to prove to be like
everything else I was doing,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.145 align:middle line:84%
which that I went into
it for the love of it.

00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But then the next
thing you know,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:90%
you're at Mr. Gordy's parties.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And now, instead of
loving to write a song,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got to write
three songs a month.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It turned into a grind,
from loving something

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to feeling like,
well, now my house

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
depends upon keeping
this thing going.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And then the love is gone.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:90%
The passion is gone.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Not that I don't love music.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I still do.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But I became the
slave of the thing

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.837 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed
to set me free.

00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And that's what I
think happens to everybody.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: But it isn't that
the music indentured me.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The identity that I derived from
being a successful composer,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
from having a house with a
tennis court and horses--

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It makes sense.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Someone graduates from college
with a degree that they love.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
They get into a job.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.354 align:middle line:90%
It gets into a house family.

00:18:55.354 --> 00:18:56.895 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
the job they're

00:18:56.895 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
a slave to because they
have to support the rest.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And so is that a loop of fear?

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It is
basically a loop of fear.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Because essentially I
believe that in order

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
for me to maintain who and
what I've taken myself to be,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I am going to have to
make this sacrifice so

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:90%
that I can keep these things.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue
strenuously, what good

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is it to keep these things if,
in truth, they are keeping you?

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Thoreau used to
say, show me a man

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
who takes possession
of a piece of property,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you
a man who becomes

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
possessed by his property.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:90%
So what's the alternative?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Let it all go?

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.373 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No.

00:19:36.373 --> 00:19:38.975 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course,
that's always the opposite.

00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: The extreme.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I'm going to go
live on a mountain and count

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%
pomegranate seeds.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is
understand that there

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is an order to things,
Lisa, a true priority.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If my real priority
is first and foremost

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to be an individual
of character,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to not live with
fear, not to find

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
a fearless life
but to understand

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
how painful and punishing
and relationship-destroying

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
it is, health-destroying
to live with fear,

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
eventually a person realizes
I have to make a choice.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I must choose in favor of
knowing the truth of myself,

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to choose
in favor of what

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:90%
fear tells me is true about me.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So describe a person
who lives their life with fear,

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and then we can see if
we identify with this.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
What would that
person look like?

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It's a person who
basically, one way or another,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
every day spends their
time doing mostly what they

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do,
rushing to do it,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:84%
hoping to get to the end
of it so they can have

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.862 align:middle line:84%
the refreshment of the few
minutes they've imagined.

00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
there, they can't

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.925 align:middle line:84%
enjoy that because their
mind has already taken them

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to what they have
to do tomorrow.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound familiar?

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A little.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's
this nature of ours.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a nature that feels like
it has to control everyone.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a nature that is often
impatient with things that

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
don't go the way
we want it to go.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, it's
something that never

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
stops looking around, waiting
for another shoe to fall.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.221 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But what about that
creative desire of saying yes

00:21:16.221 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to things because you
really do love them.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.251 align:middle line:84%
But then you say
yes to too many.

00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:21.459 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: This is why
there's no substitute for true

00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
spiritual knowledge.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Look, the love of something
does not turn a person

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
into the slave of
the thing they love.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
If a person becomes
the slave of the thing

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
they love, then love will
make a master of them.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But if what I love
turns me into a slave,

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
it's because now I am
identified with the thing

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing that I loved
and all of the accoutrements

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:90%
connected with it.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And now it isn't love that
lives my life anymore.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It is who I have become
as a result of that, so

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.229 align:middle line:90%
my sense of identity.

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Boy, I hope this isn't too
deep, but it's so important.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.019 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, but
how is that fear?

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
How is that fear, that love
of what you've created?

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:90%
How is that fear?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It isn't the
love of what you created.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the identification
with being a creator.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've done.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.619 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't notice it,
something's wrong with you.

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
notice it, I'm going

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to do everything I can to
get it in front of you.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the natural
movement of any artistic person

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to want people to appreciate
what they've done.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.646 align:middle line:90%
There's no escaping that.

00:22:25.646 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about any
goal-oriented person?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:90%
What about anyone who wants--

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Another
perfect example.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
If I have a goal, and my goal
is to become someone special,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead before I start.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead before I start.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
If my goal is to accomplish
something because through it

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to discover
something about myself,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe make the world a better
place, then I don't set out

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
on that path trying to get the
world around me to go, oh, what

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:90%
a great person.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Look how special you are.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I do it because I love
something special.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So what about the I
want to change a million minds

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
type of thing or change
the world and so forth?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.754 align:middle line:84%
That is setting
yourself up for failure?

00:23:05.754 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: It depends.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.619 align:middle line:84%
That's six of one and
half a dozen other.

00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
If you think that you're here
to change the world based

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:90%
on who you are, you're deluded.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you're here
and in you there's

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
an innate love of this
life and a recognition

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we've missed
the mark severely--

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and I think this
is important-- then

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:90%
you work to change yourself.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You do the interior gardening.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And if something beautiful
grows inside of you--

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
like Christ used to say,
you don't light a lamp

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and put it under a bushel--
you radiate what you are.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
get people to see it.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're not even
interested in people seeing it,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
because you're already content
because of your relationship

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.667 align:middle line:84%
with that love that moved
you to do what it did.

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So I think we've got a
clear picture on what it means

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to live with fear and how that
does cause stress and anxiety

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and depression and illness.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do we have any models
out there in the world of what

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.444 align:middle line:84%
it means to live fearlessly,
to live without fear?

00:24:08.444 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I think if there
are you could count them

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
on your fingers.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Hmm.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Gandhi?

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Here's the deal.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.685 align:middle line:84%
You asked me, what is the life
of a person who is fearful?

00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It's a person who is
more concerned moment to moment

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
with their appearance than
they are with the development

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.672 align:middle line:90%
of their soul.

00:24:28.672 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's a
really good definition.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And most of us are
constantly caught up trying

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to maintain everything.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't maintain
who you think you are

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and develop the bottom of
yourself, the truth of yourself

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other hand, your
soul concern-- S-O-U-L--

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is to become a true
harmless, innocent, kind,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
compassionate human being, a
self-realizing human being,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
then everything else in the
world's going to take care

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.655 align:middle line:90%
of itself.

00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
We forget that we're
creations, Lisa.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
We really think,
the world around us

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
has led us to
believe, that we are

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
the ones responsible for
manifesting our lives.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.075 align:middle line:84%
There is only half
a truth in that.

00:25:16.075 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
What we are is in fact
part of a greater story.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
When the greater story says,
this is what's going to happen,

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you can sit and say, no, no,
no, that's not the story I want.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's still the story.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And you not wanting it
doesn't change anything

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:90%
except make you crazy.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that makes
a very good point.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.632 align:middle line:84%
And it's also I'm still looking
for that model of an example,

00:25:38.632 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
like maybe a story
you can tell us,

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
because I learn through
stories, of what it

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
would be like to
live fearlessly.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.547 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we've seen it in a film.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Here's a story.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's going in one
of my new books.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.995 align:middle line:84%
This would be an example
of a man or a woman

00:25:53.995 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
who's learned to
live fearlessly.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: So imagine a
fellow's hiking through a valley

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
someplace in a national park,
and overhead and behind him,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
without knowing it, a great
big thunderstorm is forming up.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And the park ranger,
knowing that when

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the thunderstorms come
flash floods come,

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:84%
he's immediately on
lookout in this tower.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh my god, that
man down the valley, he's gone.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
He has no idea the
flood's coming.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.874 align:middle line:84%
So he races down to
try to warn the man.

00:26:21.874 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Now the man's just
hiking, looking

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:90%
at all the beautiful stuff.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
lightning, thunder, here

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:90%
comes the flash flood.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:90%
The ranger runs down.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
He knows the man is toast.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he can save him
on the other side.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the floodwaters,
stones, business,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and the park ranger
can't believe his eyes.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
The man turns around and says
something, literally just

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:90%
says a few words.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know how
this sounds, but I

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
tell you spiritually
this is true,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and the waters part and
just rush around the man.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And the park ranger is stunned.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Waters go by.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.397 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what happened?

00:26:56.397 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Was that magic?

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.815 align:middle line:84%
And the man said,
no, that's not magic.

00:27:00.815 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, what did you say?

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:90%
What did you say to the waters?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.066 align:middle line:84%
The man said, I simply
said you go on without me.

00:27:08.066 --> 00:27:09.507 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: To the ranger.

00:27:09.507 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: He said
that to the ranger.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.812 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: To the waters.

00:27:11.812 --> 00:27:12.311 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:27:12.311 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: The man who was
threatened with the waters just

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
told the waters to
go on without him.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to do that
with any fearful thoughts,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:90%
any flood of feelings.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.865 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
ourselves so thoroughly

00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that when these things come and
the surge comes and the storms,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:90%
we know that.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We compromise ourselves
when we're carried away.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:90%
What are we carried away by?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts and feelings.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mm hmm.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: You are not meant
to be the servant of thoughts

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and feelings.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:90%
They're intended to serve you.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.792 align:middle line:84%
You are created with authority
over these things, Lisa.

00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:49.291 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What if those thoughts
and feelings are things that

00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:90%
are currently happening?

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
There is anger in
a relationship,

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:90%
or there is hatred in the world.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:90%
There are bombings.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:90%
What if those are happening?

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: You tell me.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
What good is it to
hate someone who hates?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
What good is it to be
afraid of something

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that you have no control over
the exterior circumstance

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that's produced
it in that moment?

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you can't
look at the event and realize,

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.604 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:28:18.604 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:90%
There's been enough of this.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to dedicate my life
to something positive that's

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.596 align:middle line:84%
not going to be part
of this destruction.

00:28:24.596 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the moment of
the event, in the moment

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that the husband or the
wife or someone at work

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
causes that violence
in you, you tell me,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.486 align:middle line:84%
where is the wisdom in answering
violence with violence?

00:28:35.486 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: There isn't.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But take the Newtown
shootings, for example,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:90%
or the Boston bombings.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at these people
who did these acts of horror

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to children, innocent children.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No question about it.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: As a mother,
as a human being,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.996 align:middle line:84%
I feel fear about
that situation.

00:28:55.996 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though it
didn't happen to me,

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel for the moms
who lost their babies.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: As a human being,
we must feel this compassion,

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and we must recognize the
imminent danger of living

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
in a world where desperation
has reached such a point that

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
everything is
spontaneously combusting.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the world.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But the reason the world
is that way, Lisa, is

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
because human beings don't
understand I can do something

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.800 align:middle line:84%
higher with this fear
than let it define me.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I can do something
higher with this anxiety

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.999 align:middle line:84%
than let it tell me who
I am and what to do.

00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because those
moments will happen again.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: They're
going to happen again.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.093 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:29:35.093 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: That's the beauty of
the true spiritual life is that

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.650 align:middle line:84%
every moment of our existence
offers us a certain revelation.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:90%
This is important to get into.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.492 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that when
you go out and look outside

00:29:48.492 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
at a beautiful night
sky, or maybe you're

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the redwoods that you
take in those impressions,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.380 align:middle line:84%
do you not think to
yourself, this is gorgeous,

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I love the harmony
and the peace?

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Now the reason that
you feel the way you do is

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
because what you're looking at
around you is actually stirring

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in you a part of yourself that
you were asleep to the moment

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.457 align:middle line:84%
before, an aspect of
your very consciousness--

00:30:10.457 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: True.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --brought into an
awareness of itself through

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
the environment.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're all for it when
we see beautiful things,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
because we understand that
this relationship is actually

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:84%
revealing to me
something I wouldn't know

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.220 align:middle line:84%
about myself without
that relationship.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Agreed?

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Why would it be
any different in moments like

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in New Jersey or any place
else, every moment serving

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.790 align:middle line:84%
as a revelation of a part of
myself that I didn't know was

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.870 align:middle line:84%
there, including this
anger, including this fear?

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But instead of then letting
the fear and anger come up

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and tell me let's
do this, let's do

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that, to recognize
you go on without me

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
means I have the reaction I'm
a human being, I feel the pain,

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
but now I want to be present
to this whole thing instead

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of letting it pull me down into
a world where basically I'm

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:90%
not even choosing anymore.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.745 align:middle line:84%
My choices are
being made for me.

00:31:06.745 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you're basically
attracting so much

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:90%
fear that it comes to you.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a little bit
lofty, but resistance

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.330 align:middle line:90%
is negative attraction.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No, that makes sense.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: The more you
don't want something--

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It comes
right towards you.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.785 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Not only that,
the more I don't want it,

00:31:23.785 --> 00:31:25.607 align:middle line:90%
I'm paying attention to it.

00:31:25.607 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And waiting
for it to happen.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we've seen so many
situations be on lock down.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what that situation is,
is it's attracting the fear.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of friends
who have severe anxiety,

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and most of their
anxiety stems from things

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
that have never happened.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.645 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Or ever will.

00:31:43.645 --> 00:31:44.228 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:31:44.228 --> 00:31:45.622 align:middle line:90%
Well-- in their mind it will.

00:31:45.622 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Of course it will.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Of course it will.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.843 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And eventually, if a
person holds that thought long

00:31:49.843 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
enough, they well may manifest
that particular thing they

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But there's no
way I can tell her that.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.048 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I
can tell my friend

00:31:57.048 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that if you wait long
enough, it's going to happen.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
No way of being able to
hear something like that.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:90%
How could I help her?

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell me this.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: By being
an example yourself.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.305 align:middle line:90%
You can't make people see.

00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: She looks
at me as an alien.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.206 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:32:13.206 --> 00:32:14.289 align:middle line:90%
You can't make people see.

00:32:14.289 --> 00:32:17.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, along the
line, the more you

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
try to make people see, even
something good and true,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.780 align:middle line:84%
the more you actually strengthen
the resistance in them,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:84%
not only to what you're saying,
but validating their right

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:90%
to be a future victim.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You are correct.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: You can't
change that, Lisa.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You are correct.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:90%
But I want to.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:90%
What do I do about it?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:90%
What does anyone do about it?

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Let that person's
see you respond completely

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:90%
different one day.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Let them be around
you, and here comes

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:84%
somebody being
disrespectful, here

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:84%
come some news that ordinarily
would knock a person flat.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And you say inwardly to
those thoughts and feelings,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.419 align:middle line:90%
you go on without me.

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And then you're standing there.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:90%
You're present to yourself.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:90%
You're compassionate.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.306 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to hurt
somebody else because

00:32:58.306 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:90%
of the pressure in you.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And a person who actually sees
somebody meet a moment truly

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
in what I call the presence
moment, inwardly they're going,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:90%
what was that?

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know
something about that.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Not what she says, I
want to know something

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:90%
about that character.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Then there's an opening,
and they may actually ask.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And then if they ask,
then you can share.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Or you could be of
service to someone who is

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:84%
hurting or in a lot
of pain because of--

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah, that's right.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
that we do without knowing it

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:84%
actually is that when
people are afraid

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.541 align:middle line:84%
and we try to convince
them not to be or tell them

00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
all the reasons that they
should do this or the other,

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:84%
we're actually enabling
the fearful nature.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
strengthening it in them.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the more they resist the
correction or the redirection,

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.617 align:middle line:84%
the more it validates the
very thing inside of them

00:33:45.617 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to fix.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's interesting.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:48.654 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:48.654 --> 00:33:49.945 align:middle line:90%
That's a very, very good point.

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:50.611 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
We enable people all the
time with these things.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.214 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So instead of preaching
and thus enabling, just be.

00:33:56.214 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Or they come in and start--
people come to you, oh no,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:90%
crying and complaining.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And then our typical
attitude is that it

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.704 align:middle line:90%
elicits in us a certain nature.

00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I don't
want them to be in pain,

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
so I got to get you quieted
down so I'm not in pain.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.489 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, you're

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.340 align:middle line:84%
talking to that
fearful, whining nature.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what it wants.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's doing that.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really want
what it's asking for.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:90%
It wants to be validated.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.884 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, this is a
point that I really am wanting

00:34:26.884 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:90%
your help in getting across.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact that
we don't see an example

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
in our society of what it
means to live life fearlessly

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is all the more reason of
what you're talking about

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
And it also needs to be taught.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have great,
great pictures

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:84%
that you have put together
with some phrases around them.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.109 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
these as teaching moments.

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:48.067 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Let's do it.

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So here's the first
one that you have here.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:84%
There are no dead
ends in real life.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean, there
are no dead ends in real life?

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: OK.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Directly connected to what
we've been talking about.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: The limit of your
present view is not the limit

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:90%
of your possibilities.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The limit of your
present view is not

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:90%
the limit of your possibilities.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're afraid, when
anybody's afraid, does fear go,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.140 align:middle line:90%
look at all these possibilities?

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Or does it say, you've got to
control, or you've got to run?

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Fight and flight.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:90%
That's basically all fear knows.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.161 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: How many
possibilities are there

00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:90%
in fight and flight?

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Zero.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Literally zero--

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.346 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: There's
fight and flight.

00:35:30.346 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --because either one
strengthens the fearful nature.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.379 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: There's to
fight or to flee. yeah.

00:35:35.379 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Either one
strengthens the belief that

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
this moment is bigger than I
am and that my only possible

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:90%
answer to it is these answers.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.770 align:middle line:84%
When you start to recognize
that here comes the fear,

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.770 align:middle line:84%
here comes the worry,
you go on without me,

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
now you're left in
the present moment.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.860 align:middle line:90%
You've got your creative energy.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You have all the infinite
number of possibilities

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that are always
appearing, because life

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:84%
is a convergence
of possibilities,

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're not limited to what
fear, worry, or anxiety is

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:90%
telling you.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So when you make
decisions, Guy, in your life,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.635 align:middle line:84%
do you make them just
based on what is?

00:36:07.635 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do you
think ahead of time?

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:10.896 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Well, it depends.

00:36:10.896 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:90%
And we must clarify.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I run a nonprofit organization.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We send out newsletters
to 142 countries.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.669 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
business side of it.

00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to be practical.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:22.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to plan.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:25.949 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you get behind
in a curve of IT, you're dead.

00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%

to plan to pay taxes.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.445 align:middle line:90%
You have to plan, yeah.

00:36:28.445 --> 00:36:30.236 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: No, you've
got to do that stuff.

00:36:30.236 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But most of the decisions
with my own life,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and including with the
people who volunteer,

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:84%
staff, always I don't ever make
up my mind ahead of time ever.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.576 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
things that people

00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:90%
fear the most, death, taxes.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about those.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.660 align:middle line:84%
How would you look at
those without fear?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.789 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Because you
understand when we think

00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
of death, what are
we thinking about?

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Fear of the unknown.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you know you can't
fear the unknown?

You can only fear the known.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can't know
what death is.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: People fear the
unknown all the time.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.453 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No, they don't.

00:37:07.453 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They fear what their mind
tells them is going to happen,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:90%
and they call that unknown.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't fear what is unknown.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:90%
What is unknown you don't know.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.430 align:middle line:90%
We fear the known.

I said no fear without
negative imagination?

So here I am, I'm sick.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And even deeper than that, I'm
sick and what I really fear

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm going to be
inadequate to this thing.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But spiritually we're
intended to live

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in a world that's always
fresh, always new.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.462 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have fear
where something's always new.

00:38:50.462 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, this next slide
actually says that directly.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.503 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Oh.

00:38:53.503 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It says the
false life is exhausting,

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and real life is inexhaustible.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.477 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Exactly.

00:39:01.477 --> 00:39:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's beautiful.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: When we live,
which we're intended to do,

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in what I call the presence
moment, this actual moment,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:84%
not thinking about it, but just
quietly aware of ourselves,

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:84%
there is an inexhaustible
amount of energy in it,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:90%
more than can be spoken.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.490 align:middle line:84%
The source of creativity
is not the individual

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:90%
who is a creative person.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:84%
The person is an instrument
of these creative energies.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And as an instrument of
these creative energies,

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.760 align:middle line:84%
don't I want to be open all
the time to those vital forces

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
because they are
life themselves?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But if I get caught
in a pattern,

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:84%
if my mind is afraid,
if I'm resisting,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
you can't resist and
create at the same time.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't resist and
learn at the same time.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's very true.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be in those two
states at the exact same time.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That's it.

00:39:51.905 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You can either be
in resistance or in learning.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That's it.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.826 align:middle line:84%
We've touched on
something so important.

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if I actually understand
that, all I have to do

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:84%
is be aware of the fact
in any given moment,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, here comes
the resistance,

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:06.230 align:middle line:84%
realize, you know what,
this is a limited, dead end,

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.792 align:middle line:90%
interior state.

00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I must have nothing
to do with resisting.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the alternative?

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to become
conscious of myself, including

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
this fear and worry
that's come up in me.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to let it go on
without me so that I can stay

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.100 align:middle line:84%
in this creative moment
and be given everything

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.159 align:middle line:84%
I need, by the way, to
deal effectively with it.

00:40:24.159 --> 00:40:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's a law
of physics, isn't it?

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It is
a law of physics.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.465 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Two things can't
exist in the same space--

00:40:28.465 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That's exactly right.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --at the same time.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:30.056 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:40:30.056 --> 00:40:32.822 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you cannot be
in fear and in imagination

00:40:32.822 --> 00:40:33.530 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:90%
You can be in either/or.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be afraid and
know what is limitless.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be creative and
afraid at the same time.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.727 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:40:42.727 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That makes sense.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel that fear
coming up or anticipating

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
coming up, you can make
the conscious choice

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.956 align:middle line:84%
to switch to the place
of what else instead?

00:40:54.956 --> 00:40:55.455 align:middle line:90%
Imagination?

00:40:55.455 --> 00:40:55.954 align:middle line:90%
Creativity?

00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No, no.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Not imagination.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:57.923 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: None?

00:40:57.923 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: You make the
conscious choice to be aware

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of what fearful thoughts and
feelings are telling you is

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.024 align:middle line:84%
true instead of believing that
the thoughts and feelings that

00:41:10.024 --> 00:41:10.565 align:middle line:90%
are fearful--

00:41:10.565 --> 00:41:11.315 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Are real.

00:41:11.315 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --know what
to do and who you are.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a shift
in our awareness.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead of my
attention belonging

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to the habitual movement
of these stressful, anxious

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and feelings, I become
aware of the stressful thoughts

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, and I let
them go on without me.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
They're mechanical, Lisa.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:84%
If in fact no
psychological fear exists

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
without negative
imagination, that

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
means there's a dynamic
taking place in the mind.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A habit--

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: When you were a kid--

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.598 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --essentially.

00:41:41.598 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --did you ever--
there was a haunted house when

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I was a kid.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was afraid of it.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons was
because this old woman always

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:53.789 align:middle line:84%
put out this weird little
straw-- what do they call them?

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Scarecrow?

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Scarecrow.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And if you walked by
it, this was early technology,

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:84%
the thing would do
this, and you'd jump.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:84%
That's good for the
first three years.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth year, you
realize it's a mechanical man.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Fear and anxiety are
mechanical negative states.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.250 align:middle line:84%
To understand that
they are that means

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:90%
you can begin to let them go by.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
I didn't have

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to go along with that anger,
that fear, that worry.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:84%
All I had to do was
understand something about it

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and then risk what happens when
I don't let it carry me away.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Then you're on the other
side of it, floodwaters gone.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And the park ranger's saying,
Lisa, how did you do that?

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But what if fear is--
You don't want someone to jump

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:84%
off a cliff, because into
the water it's too deep.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: There's
a difference--

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.676 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --physical,
instinctual fear.

00:42:44.676 --> 00:42:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You'd say to somebody,
listen, it's not really

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that smart to jump off of a
cliff with an elastic cord tied

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.777 align:middle line:90%
to your ankle.

00:42:54.777 --> 00:42:55.860 align:middle line:90%
But if you want to do it--

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just wanted to
make that distinction.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't walk out
into the freeway.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Your body will preserve itself.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Inwardly, we are meant to
have a spiritual part that

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.320 align:middle line:90%
won't give itself away.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So we're talking about
not reality in terms of fear.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Fear is there sometimes
to keep your body safe

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.595 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
physical danger.

00:43:14.595 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Of course.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.855 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But we're talking
about emotional fear.

00:43:15.855 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Of course.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So here's another great
slide with a beautiful image

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:19.890 align:middle line:90%
that you have around it.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.014 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: What do we have?

00:43:21.014 --> 00:43:24.265 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: A clear mind
is its own reward.

00:43:24.265 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: [SINGING] On a
clear day, you can see forever.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.330 align:middle line:84%
[NORMAL VOICE] Do
you remember that?

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mm hmm.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: On a clear
day, you can see forever.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:38.030 align:middle line:84%
A clear mind can see
literally forever.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:84%
A clear mind can
literally see forever.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It understands, because it's
a part of something whole

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that's timeless, that
the clearer it is,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.260 align:middle line:84%
the more it reflects
this timeless nature.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And the divine doesn't
have fear in it.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:90%
There's no fear in the divine.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The divine knows
that all things work

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:84%
for the good of those for
whom the good is all things.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It uses everything
to perfect itself.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But there is fear laden
in organized religion all over

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.405 align:middle line:90%
the place.

00:44:08.405 --> 00:44:10.779 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Well, who said
organized religion has anything

00:44:10.779 --> 00:44:12.574 align:middle line:90%
to do with the divine?

00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I had to
link the two together.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.199 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah, well--

00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:16.198 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: But a good one.

00:44:16.198 --> 00:44:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --a long
time ago, perhaps.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But today, most of what we
call organized religion is

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:84%
a way in which a person
can go and momentarily

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:84%
feel good about themselves
and a relationship

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.020 align:middle line:84%
with the divine,
whatever they call it

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and then get in their car and
start shaking their fist and go

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
figure out how to get
even with somebody.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, the divine is
the word in the biblical texts,

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.265 align:middle line:90%
in the Torah, in all of--

00:44:38.265 --> 00:44:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Of course it is.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:90%
But there's no fear in it.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:84%
How can that which gave
birth to all things,

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
oversees their creation,
watches over their passing,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and then brings them all back
again, however that's done,

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.020 align:middle line:90%
how can there be fear in that?

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
My definition of a
fearless life, Lisa,

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding
that everything

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that happens to a human being
happens for the good of them.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And until a person can
understand the good

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.790 align:middle line:84%
in everything that happens, they
will never know fearlessness.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as I believe
something bad can happen to me,

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.440 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
live in fear of it.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But if I were
capable-- and I am,

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:22.430 align:middle line:84%
as you are-- to recognize this
broader life-- that slide said,

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.780 align:middle line:90%
a clear mind is its own reward.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you could
see that everything works

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.140 align:middle line:84%
so that gradually the individual
can see and discover something

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.620 align:middle line:84%
about a nature they're
not conscious of.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that revelation
an integration,

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and in that integration,
the birth of a new love,

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.250 align:middle line:84%
the end of an old nature,
and the birth of a new one.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how something
could be bad in that?

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's easy to say from
the couches we're sitting on.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.580 align:middle line:84%
There are situations
in people's lives--

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've
been hit with this

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.265 align:middle line:84%
over 35 years of
talking about this.

00:45:54.265 --> 00:45:55.322 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: I've been it.

00:45:55.322 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been run over
by-- I'm not going

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to go into my own personal
list of physical injuries.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.010 align:middle line:84%
My body has been through
more than most war vets have

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:84%
been through, and I
mean that literally,

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.125 align:middle line:90%
including mortal sicknesses.

00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:10.580 align:middle line:84%
This is not a pipe
dream I'm talking about.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the fact
that a human being is created

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to use every
moment that happens

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to them to discover that
whatever negative reaction they

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
have to the event belongs
to who they have been

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and as who they
have been no longer

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.810 align:middle line:90%
has to guide who they can be.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We literally are intended to
be reborn moment to moment

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in the truest sense
of the word, not

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:84%
cling to who we've been because
it says, I don't want this,

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.380 align:middle line:84%
or you don't understand my
pain, and all the rest of that.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, the example that
comes to mind is someone who

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.112 align:middle line:90%
suddenly loses a loved one.

00:46:44.112 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Of course
there's grief.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.830 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I love my wife.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:84%
We've been together
for over 30 years.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And the thought
of her not being here,

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.500 align:middle line:90%
it's more than you can bear.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I grieved for two weeks over
the loss of my Rottweiler.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Grief, though, is intended
to be an experience,

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's intended to pass.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:84%
All of these conditions,
you look in people's lives

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and they become a
professional griever.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:84%
They become a professional
hater of this, that,

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:90%
or the other thing.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
That means that the moment
that produced the discovery

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%
has passed on,
but the thing that

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
was brought up to
bear inside of them,

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:90%
now it goes on and on and on.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And that person is unteachable.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.124 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can help them.

00:47:25.124 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That is true.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.490 align:middle line:84%
When severe things
happen to people,

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.557 align:middle line:84%
look at the
experiences that we saw

00:47:30.557 --> 00:47:33.223 align:middle line:84%
or the profiles that we saw from
some of these heinous acts that

00:47:33.223 --> 00:47:33.848 align:middle line:90%
have been done.

00:47:33.848 --> 00:47:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Those people were
severely harmed--

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Of course they were.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.020 align:middle line:90%
But think of--

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --as children.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: --Viktor Frankl.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I know you'll know this.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.259 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: There are
examples in our lives.

00:47:41.259 --> 00:47:41.800 align:middle line:90%
You asked me.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Here's an example.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Here is a man who used the
worst possible conditions

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.550 align:middle line:84%
an individual could be thrust
in to change his nature,

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and in changing his nature, to
be a light and an inspiration

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to everyone else there to teach
them how to use hell on earth.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And that he did.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And so are you saying
to use those things,

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.810 align:middle line:84%
find your point of
awareness in them,

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and turn them into
teaching moments?

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: There's
an old saying.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.515 align:middle line:84%
When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear.

00:48:14.515 --> 00:48:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:16.991 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Who do you
think the teacher is?

00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yourself.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: It's every moment.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It's everything someone
doesn't say to you.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
someone throws at you.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It's every moment that life
turns left instead of right.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.549 align:middle line:90%
That's the teacher.

00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
teacher, that means

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the school and the
curriculum is timeless,

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.760 align:middle line:84%
as is my possibility to be a
true aspirant in that world.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You have to
turn that into a slide.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: [LAUGHS]

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.046 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do.

00:48:39.046 --> 00:48:39.655 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:90%
That is brilliant.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Every moment is the teacher.

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Every moment is
the teacher if we're present.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:48.080 align:middle line:84%
If we're not, which we're
not, by and large, it's

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.490 align:middle line:84%
because the last
moment caught me,

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still trying
to deal with something

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:53.570 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't even exist anymore.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Where you try to
be the interviewer in this

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.550 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's happening.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.490 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to another
slide, which I love.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:00.903 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: OK.

00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's we are made
to live without fear.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.236 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:06.000 align:middle line:84%
How are we made to
live without fear?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: That's just
what we've been discussing,

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that every moment creates
in me by a convergence--

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:84%
do you understand that we
are made in the image of God?

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Made in the image of God doesn't
mean, especially looking at me,

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.360 align:middle line:90%
this is not the image of God.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But it means that you are
the embodiment of everything

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that came to create
all there is.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Did you know you're
literally made

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:84%
of stardust, Lisa, literally,
and that everything that

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.465 align:middle line:90%
exists you're it?

00:49:39.465 --> 00:49:41.960 align:middle line:84%
All these forces,
they live in us.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.530 align:middle line:84%
If it's true, which
it is, then that

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:84%
means that they're always going
through this beautiful change.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:84%
If they're going
through true change

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's divinely
guided, which it is, then

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:84%
which way am I better off,
trying to guide myself

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:84%
through something in which
I'm forever being grabbed

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and dragged down, or to
realize that by my very nature,

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I am created to be
someone who dies

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to who he has been
the moment before?

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And if I die to who I've
been the moment before

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.550 align:middle line:84%
because the teacher shows me
he doesn't serve you anymore--

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Then you're
no longer living.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: --where's the fear?

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.561 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: That's why
we're made to be fearless,

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.520 align:middle line:90%
because we're made to change.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We are living our lives
dead to the moments that we

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.920 align:middle line:90%
were before a lot.

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.878 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Which is right
out of the scripture.

00:50:29.878 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.786 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:50:31.786 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.685 align:middle line:90%
Let the dead bury the dead.

00:50:34.685 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks
that's talking--

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's what that means.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.256 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --about
somebody else.

00:50:38.256 --> 00:50:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Thanks for
interpreting that for me.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
great, great quote.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And it helps to use these
as teaching moments as well,

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.340 align:middle line:84%
just the phrases that
you're saying here.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But these are put
around beautiful slides.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You are created to
turn any dark moment

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.570 align:middle line:84%
into a golden
moment, a golden one.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Think
about the sun rising.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.572 align:middle line:84%
What's more beautiful
than the first light?

00:51:07.572 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It does.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The rays of the sun do
kiss every single thing--

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Now think about--

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.286 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --it touches.

00:51:11.286 --> 00:51:14.168 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: --here comes this
moment that I don't want.

00:51:14.168 --> 00:51:15.492 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: What's more beautiful
than the fact that instead

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.080 align:middle line:84%
of being overrun by a darkness
in myself that says, oh,

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't, this won't work,
what am I going to do,

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:27.350 align:middle line:84%
instead that moment awakens
in me the light of a new

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.860 align:middle line:90%
understanding about myself?

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And that new
understanding recognizes

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that these negative states,
they need to go on without me so

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that I can stand here and be
part of this creative moment,

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:84%
fully maximizing
every possibility,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and in doing so enjoying the
moment, learning from it.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.600 align:middle line:90%
High or low, up or down.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what would it be
like that everything that

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
happens to you turns
out to be something

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that you know is good for you.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Would you run from anything?

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.969 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:51:56.969 --> 00:51:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Would you avoid
people because they troubled

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.006 align:middle line:90%
you?

00:52:00.006 --> 00:52:00.557 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:52:00.557 --> 00:52:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Here's what you would say
to troublesome moments.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.583 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
exercise, by the way.

00:52:04.583 --> 00:52:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Here's what you say
when a situation comes along

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:90%
inwardly that you don't want.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:16.910 align:middle line:84%
You say, thanks, I didn't
know that about myself.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Not hey, I don't like
this, I don't want you.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Hey, thanks, I didn't
know that about myself.

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that when
I walked into this room

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that I was carrying
with me this attitude.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know when
I was on the phone

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that I thought that
I was never meant

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.166 align:middle line:84%
to hang on the phone for 30
minutes and talk to somebody.

00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.725 align:middle line:90%
Just let everything teach you.

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Here's an example.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up, you're in a
bad mood, things go wrong,

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.030 align:middle line:84%
you already knew that it
was going to go wrong,

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
shift out of the bad mood,

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and you're trying to shift.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.847 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:52:55.847 --> 00:52:57.430 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
yourself to that place?

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously
that cycle is fear.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Should
we do something?

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Can we do something on camera?

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: My right hand is
going to represent the things

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:90%
that I really want.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Your right hand is
going to represent the things

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.380 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:12.930 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:13.860 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.560 align:middle line:90%
I wake up in the morning.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.510 align:middle line:90%
This is how I want it.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Now here comes the
things I don't want.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to get rid of it.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:19.220 align:middle line:90%
What am I--

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Get rid-- no,
get rid of that stuff.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Resitance.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: What's happening?

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:23.646 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:53:23.646 --> 00:53:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Lots of resistance.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.916 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Are we
getting further?

00:53:25.916 --> 00:53:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Am I actually
creating space by not

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.580 align:middle line:90%
wanting to feel the way I do?

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Or does not wanting to
feel the way I do actually

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.540 align:middle line:84%
make me feel more of the
thing I don't want to feel?

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:37.765 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes.

00:53:37.765 --> 00:53:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:38.829 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:40.705 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
perpetual motion happens.

00:53:40.705 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That's it.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The more I don't want to feel
something, the more I feel it.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Resistance to the disturbance
is the disturbance.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How do you
break the pattern?

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: You don't break it.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.258 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:53:55.258 --> 00:53:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Right back to the start.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.238 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I can tell you
that I'm in a bad mood.

00:53:58.238 --> 00:53:59.330 align:middle line:90%
How's that going to help?

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.538 align:middle line:84%
>>FINLEY: Because, you see,
when we're in a bad mood,

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:90%
our mind is telling us why.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.045 align:middle line:84%
So the mind explaining
why I'm in a bad mood

00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:84%
is actually justifying the
nature that's negative,

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.959 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yes, it is.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, fully.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:14.125 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That makes me right.

00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That makes me right.

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:16.060 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.532 align:middle line:90%
So I'm right to feel wrong.

00:54:19.532 --> 00:54:20.115 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:54:20.115 --> 00:54:21.823 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: I'm right
to hurt other people

00:54:21.823 --> 00:54:22.761 align:middle line:90%
because I'm negative.

00:54:22.761 --> 00:54:24.386 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that's
ludicrous, isn't it?

00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:84%
The one you're really
hurting is yourself.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.613 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Ah.

00:54:27.613 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:84%
We get to a very
important exercise.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Anything inside of
a human being that

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.460 align:middle line:84%
wants to justify them feeling
angry, frightened, negative,

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.970 align:middle line:84%
any of those things that
come up and start telling you

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle line:84%
this is why you
feel the way you do

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
are not trying to help you
out of your negative state.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They're digging the hole deeper
for that nature to fall into.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The passive, quiet
observation, I

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.910 align:middle line:84%
call it learning to be
watchful instead of willful.

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Watchful instead of willful.

00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:59.510 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I wake
up, I'm negative,

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and I'm pushing stuff away.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.409 align:middle line:84%
That resistance has a
real will, doesn't it?

00:55:05.409 --> 00:55:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: But is it my will?

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.394 align:middle line:84%
Or does it belong to something
that ostensibly seems to be me

00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:12.560 align:middle line:84%
but actually is keeping me
in the hands of something

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.255 align:middle line:90%
I don't want?

00:55:13.255 --> 00:55:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Ah.

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:15.175 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:55:15.175 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Watchful not willful.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So I come back to
myself, and I become

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.654 align:middle line:84%
aware of my pain instead
of trying to get rid of it.

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do you find other
things that might make you feel

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.907 align:middle line:90%
better, like petting a cat or--

00:55:29.907 --> 00:55:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No.

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No?

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: All of that is a way
to try to console the nature

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.900 align:middle line:90%
that feels unhappy.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.737 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:55:35.737 --> 00:55:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Look, if
you had a friend--

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, I guess
then that would--

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --lead to addictions
and stuff like that.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:40.831 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Exactly.

00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:43.040 align:middle line:84%
How many times would you
let a friend of yours

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.834 align:middle line:84%
who steals money from your
purse into your house?

00:55:45.834 --> 00:55:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mm hmm.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: Well, why would
I then allow this nature

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to continually push me from
pillar to post telling me what

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I should do to console it?

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to console you.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to understand
you out of existence.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to learn so
much about this nature

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that when it
appears and wants me

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to do what it wants me to do,
I'm going to be watchful of it

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:10.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of being its will,
the instrument of its will.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.708 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What I'm getting, and
I really want to get to this

00:56:12.708 --> 00:56:16.872 align:middle line:84%
point before we have to go,
is to break the pattern.

00:56:16.872 --> 00:56:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: That breaks
the pattern, Lisa.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Observing the state
breaks the pattern,

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to understand that resistance
is part of the pattern.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:84%
You can understand
that, can't you?

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Is resistance not
part of the pattern?

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:84%
The more I don't want
something-- we just did this.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The more I don't want
it, the more the pattern

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.290 align:middle line:90%
is strengthened, not weakened.

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:84%
To observe this
nature is to begin

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to understand it is not I.
I'm going to say it again.

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.000 align:middle line:84%
To observe the fear, the
anger, the negativity

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to realize
it is not who I am.

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It convinces me that
I am this state.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You are not any negative
state that appears in you.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The observation of it proves
it, because now you know, god,

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to hurt myself.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't care who it's for.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so once you do
something that you invalidate

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.160 align:middle line:84%
yourself for, you
be aware of it.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.210 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, that was
not a good decision.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I am letting go of
that and not going

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to make that decision again.

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: And now
I'm going to watch.

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:15.415 align:middle line:90%
And here comes the mind.

00:57:15.415 --> 00:57:17.395 align:middle line:84%
It's going to say, yeah,
but what about this?

00:57:17.395 --> 00:57:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just to never do it
again is the way that you can--

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: That's it.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.550 align:middle line:84%
When it starts
talking to you, watch.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Observe the conversation.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.516 align:middle line:90%
Don't get dragged into it.

00:57:25.516 --> 00:57:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.929 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:57:27.929 --> 00:57:29.720 align:middle line:84%
That would prevent it
from happening again.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.636 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:30.636 --> 00:57:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, again,
these are great moments.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So much more
information is to be

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:84%
found in your books
and the audios

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and listening to you lecture.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.401 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: [SIGHS]

00:57:40.401 --> 00:57:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That was
a workout for you?

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Did I give you a
workout there, Guy?

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> FINLEY: No, no.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
to myself, it's true.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If I could say one thing to
the people who are watching us,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
you don't understand

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.320 align:middle line:84%
what a unique creation you are
and that you mustn't settle.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.520 align:middle line:84%
We have settled in this life
for a very mediocre existence

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in which, again, everything
about who we are we

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.610 align:middle line:84%
think depends on
something outside of us.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.406 align:middle line:84%
We can have something
so much more than that.

00:58:08.406 --> 00:58:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thank you so much.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> FINLEY: It was
a pleasure, Lisa.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness,
the pleasure has been mine.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like to share
my interview with Guy

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Finley with your friends,
go to gaiamtv.com.

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:23.225 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.
