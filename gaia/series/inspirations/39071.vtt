>>LISA GARR: Hi, Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:10%
Is there a pain that you would
like to heal in your life?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.276 align:middle line:10%
It could be physical pain.

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:90%
It could be emotional pain.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It could be financial
pain-- any type of pain.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
technique, which is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:84%
a combination of ancient
Chinese acupressure

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and modern psychology, and it's
called the emotional freedom

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:90%
technique.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%
It's also known as tapping.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.817 align:middle line:84%
And it is shown to
significantly alleviate pain.

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, joining me is Nick Ortner.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
foremost experts

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional
freedom technique,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and he is responsible for
bringing this technique

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to the masses.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
How long ago was EFT, or this
whole concept, brought about?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: It was
actually 30 years ago.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:10%
It's been that long
that it was originally

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
discovered, this tapping
process, where we're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.722 align:middle line:10%
tapping on endpoints of
meridians on our body by a guy

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Roger Callahan.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:10%
He was a traditional
psychologist

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:10%
working with a client,
struggling with a client, who

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:10%
had a water phobia, by name of
Mary, and nothing was working.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:10%
They were talking--
traditional talk therapy,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:10%
looking at the water--

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.494 align:middle line:10%
nothing was working.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:10%
And when they were
looking at the water,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
she says-- this was after a
year and a half of working

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.468 align:middle line:10%
on it-- she says, you know,
when I look at that pool,

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:10%
I get a queasy feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:10%
It so happens, the
night before, he

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:10%
was reading about the
meridians in the body

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:10%
and where they ended, and
that the stomach meridian ends

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:10%
underneath the eye.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:10%
So on a whim, he said,
try typing there.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So Mary taps there and the
phobia clears like that.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So he was--

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he wasn't an
acupuncturist or anything, he--

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: No, he was a
psychologist who was just

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:90%
looking at Eastern practices.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And with that one case, said,
wow, what happened here?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.452 align:middle line:90%
So he started going deeper.

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine if
you've been practicing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
traditional psychology for a
decade, two decades, and all

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, doing this,
and a water phobia clears,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
you've got to look further.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
He developed a set of
algorithms or a sequence

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
where you would do different
tapping for different things.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:10%
So if you were angry,
you would do one thing.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're anxious,
you would do another.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
complicated to try

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.399 align:middle line:90%
to remember what to do when.

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:10%
It was kind like you
needed a chart to see.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:10%
And then one of the students
by the name of Gary Craig

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:10%
is the guy who developed
EFT, and that's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.434 align:middle line:10%
the form of tapping I do,
emotional freedom techniques.

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:10%
And he made it simple.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:10%
He said, let's just hit all the
major end points of meridians

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.304 align:middle line:10%
every time, no matter what, that
way we can get that down pat,

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:10%

rest of the stuff.

going to give it a shot.

experiences, I remember,

I had woken up one
morning with neck pain,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:10%
like you get a
crick in your neck.

the first couple of years

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:90%

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:10%
The running joke at

say anything is
wrong around Nick

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:10%
because he'll make
you tap on it.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know me, Lisa, and
I'm a little better now.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I let people come to
me when they want to tap.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But I was just so excited
about the technique.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:10%
It was so easy to
implement, so easy to share

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:10%
with people, and something
they could walk away with.

hurts or I'm upset, this, that,

speaking to a group last night,

and the idea of making
a documentary in LA

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.632 align:middle line:10%
isn't that far fetched, because
everybody is making something.

an example of the movie.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
This is just explains the
concept of the movie called,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.396 align:middle line:84%
"The Tapping
Solution," take a look.

>>CHERYL RICHARDSON:
What I often say is, OK,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:10%
you know what?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.002 align:middle line:10%
I have this little
technique that I think

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:10%
might really be helpful here.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, it might seem
a little strange,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.638 align:middle line:10%
but if you're willing to
play along and work with me,

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:10%
let's just give it a try
and see what happens.

>>CAROL TUTTLE:
It is a tool that

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.906 align:middle line:84%
allows you to release what's
blocking the powers of healing.

>>RICK WILKES: If there is an
emotional trauma, something

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.169 align:middle line:10%
happens, something
I watch on CNN,

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:10%
something that happens
to a friend of mine,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:10%
something that
happens to me, there

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:10%
is an energetic
disruption that occurs.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And what we do is we bring
some soothing to that.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. FRED GALLO:
You bring a problem

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:10%
to mind, a trauma for example,
and you tap on your body,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>>RICK: We do that while tapping
into a particular emotional

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:10%
state, a feeling in the body.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.534 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
we're soothing it.

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE VITALE: When
I first learned

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.324 align:middle line:10%
that he was talking
about tapping

00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:10%
on different points on your
body, I think I was skeptical.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:10%
But I was also desperate.

>>WOMAN: If I can start to
open up and release some

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of these feelings that
I've had in the past

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%

that are no longer relevant.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
I have to.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no possible way.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: God, I
just have so much

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.284 align:middle line:84%
that I need to work on
to kind of save my life.

>>BRAD YATES: I think
it was Thomas Edison who

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:10%
said, if we did everything we
could, that we are capable of,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.139 align:middle line:10%
we would literally
astound ourselves.

>>JACK CANFIELD:
The problem is we've

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:10%
been trained out of that
by our conditioning,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.237 align:middle line:10%
by schools, by television.

00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>>BOB PROCTOR: So I think we got
to take a look at who we are,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:10%
and what we've got,
and how we function,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:10%
and then begin to
apply this information

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:10%
in a practical manner to
improve the quality of our life,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:10%

meant to be enjoyed.

you find these people

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.614 align:middle line:90%
and how many were there?

00:09:38.614 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK: Yeah, so there was--

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:10%
when we first started filming
the movie, we just had experts,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to go beyond
the experts talking

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:10%
about how it works.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to actually show
real, normal people, not even

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:10%
people in our community,
real people getting results.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.391 align:middle line:10%
So we reached out--

00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:10%
a couple of people
sent out e-mails.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:10%
And we had a couple hundred
applicants for these 10 spots.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: And we picked 10 people
that had challenging issues.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:90%
We went for it.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:10%
It was Jodi with
fibromyalgia, John

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:10%
with 30 years of
chronic back pain,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:10%
Rene whose wife had died 90
days earlier was suffering from,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:10%
not only the grief, but
PTSD from the actual trauma

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.722 align:middle line:10%
of the accident.

00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:10%
So all these people
with really difficult

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:10%
challenges from
around the country.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:10%
We spent a week--

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.525 align:middle line:10%
it was a whirlwind week where
we'd go to one city one day

00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:10%
and fill them in their
homes and then the next city

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:10%
and the next city
and the next city,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:10%
because we wanted
to capture them

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:10%
in their home
environments, and see OK,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:10%
are they really in pain?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:10%
What are they going through?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do they adjust
their world to their pain?

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Exactly.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:10%
And then we brought them
for this four day event

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.522 align:middle line:10%
where they did the tapping.

00:10:42.522 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And so they stayed
in the house for four days

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:10%
and you brought the
experts to them.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Exactly.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.873 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to
create an environment

00:10:48.873 --> 00:10:52.067 align:middle line:84%
where it was sort of happening
all at the same time.

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They were interacting
with each other.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:90%
They were supporting each other.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of magic happened
during those four days.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the tapping, it was
the community and the support.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:10%
And also, when you do
tapping in groups like this,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:10%
it's a really
powerful experience.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:10%
I often do workshops and speak
in front of live audiences,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:10%
bring people up,
and what happens

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:10%
is that someone comes up
and we're working one-to-one

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:10%
on an issue, and then someone in
the audience goes, oh my gosh,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.976 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe that's my issue.

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe I haven't
thought about this in 20 years.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:10%
But what she's going
through is exactly what

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:10%
I feel in my heart, and this
person helped me open that up.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So that sort of share
in that community aspect

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful part
of that tapping process.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.364 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I saw you do this
once, and we were at a retreat,

00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:35.589 align:middle line:84%
and you pulled a group out,
and it was at the beach.

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And you had a circle
of chairs on the sand,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and you were there
through the sunset,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.752 align:middle line:84%
and you were there
past the sunset.

00:11:40.752 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: It was supposed to
be a little demonstration,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:90%
but it went right into it.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.215 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It went deep.

00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
that with tapping.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%
It gets to the deep issues.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:90%
But you have to--

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, you need to know
which questions to ask.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why an expert
really does help guide you

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:90%
But not necessarily.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that in a second.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you take
a look at what tapping is.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.146 align:middle line:90%
Take a look here.

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: There's going to
be three sessions going on

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
at most times.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:10%
One will be up
here, and there will

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:10%
be practitioner, someone
working, and then

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:10%
a couple of people watching.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:10%
There'll be another one in
a room that's being filmed.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's a third one
that's not being filmed.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:10%
In terms of what we're
doing, every day,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:10%
imagine downloading
100 units of power

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:10%
or $100 that come into your
energetic bank account.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have something happened
when you're 10 years old

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and it upsets you and you
have anger towards it.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.287 align:middle line:84%
You take $2 and
you pay that there.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is
that you don't just

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:10%
pay that there once,
you pay it every day.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:10%
So $2 we can do. $90
gets you through the day.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:10%
But what happens is now
you have age 15, $3 here.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Two days ago-- $1 here.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And you end up either
bankrupt or in debt.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I like to visualize
is bringing that power back.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:10%
So it's going to be, I'd like
my $2 back from that anger,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:10%
and we're done with
that transaction,

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.791 align:middle line:10%
and now I've got
that back in myself.

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROL LOOK: Where
is your energy going?

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:10%
It's going where you focus.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:10%
So if you're focused on the
fight that you had last week

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:10%
or you're focused on the meeting
with your boss next week,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:10%
that's where your energy is
draining out of your body.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:10%
>>CHERYL: When we
get scared or when

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:10%
we have a trauma, small
trauma, or a large trauma,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:10%
often there are blocks
that get created

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:10%
in the pathways of
that energy system.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>>CAROL: It's just that energy
slows down and feels heavy,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:10%
and it contradicts our core true
self, and the natural frequency

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:10%
we're meant to be at, which
are at those higher levels.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:10%
>>JACK: Energy is supposed to
flow through us as a wave form.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:10%
It just come in.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:10%
The word emotion--
energy in emotion.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And so we say we're
emotionally moved by something.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:10%
So when I allow myself to
be moved and feel what it is

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:10%
and let it pass through me,
then there's no blockages.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>>RICK: As a
massage therapist, I

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:10%
remember touching a woman's
hip, and she vividly remembering

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:10%
almost running off a cliff.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, this memory had
been stored in her hip

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:10%
since she was 18,
about 20 years.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And she had blocked it.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she had, had
constant hip problems.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:10%
That hip-- that whole
side of her body, in fact,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:10%
she'd always viewed as the
weak side, the side that wasn't

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:10%
working as well as the other.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, when this
memory was released--

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:10%
the energy of it--

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:10%
was released from
that side of her body,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:10%
her body balanced out.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CAROL: There is this circuitry
in the body through which

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:10%
electricity and energy travels
and connects all our organs.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>>BOB: Now, it's similar to
when you walk into a house.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:10%
We've got electrical
switches now

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:10%
that are activated by
clapping your hands,

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:10%
or you can flip a switch.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:10%
And when we do that,
all the lights go on.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:10%
But we don't think
anything of that.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.529 align:middle line:10%
We expect that to happen.

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:10%
There is an electrical
system in the house.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:10%
That's the way the
house is wired.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:10%
It's an electrical
system in the body

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:10%
that's more intricate
than anything in a house.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The electrical
system in the body

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
would make the electrical
system in a supercomputer

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
look like an absolute toy.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.897 align:middle line:84%
And we really don't
understand much about it.

00:15:05.897 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BRUCE LIPTON: This
becomes relevant.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:10%
It says, OK, here's the
physical particles of my body.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:10%
Why are they in a healthy
state or why could they

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:10%
be in a sick state-- that's
the physical expression.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is,
well, to understand

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:10%
that, don't look at the body.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand the
invisible forces in the field.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:10%
>>CAROL: I tell people that it's
like gridlock in New York City.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't get down Fifth Avenue.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.366 align:middle line:90%
You can't get up 6th Avenue.

00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't get
across 23rd Street,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
if you've got blockages in these
circuits and in these pathways.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:10%
So we have to clean out the
congestion and the traffic

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:10%
in order for everything
to be moving cleanly.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DAWSON CHURCH: What
happens when a tap at some

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:10%
point on my body,
especially at one

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:10%
of those points
of low resistance,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:10%
is that a very small
electrical charge

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:10%
travels through my connective
tissue and my muscles

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:10%
to other points of my body.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICK: We use these
points in a very

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:90%
methodical intentional way.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese have
been using them how?

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, they apply pressure--

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:90%
acupressure.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They apply needles--
acupuncture--

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
along these different points.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. NORM SHEALY: So
any physical pressure

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:10%
creates an electrical current.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's what we're
doing, is we are exciting

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:10%
the electrical system.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And the nervous system,
of course, is electrical.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.165 align:middle line:84%
So tapping just initiates
an electrical current.

00:16:24.165 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now that
we're seeing a little bit

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
about how it works, what is
some of the science behind it?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Great question.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.362 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
been more recent research

00:16:33.362 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
since the movie was released
that I'm really excited about.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And what the latest
research is really showing

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:10%
is that when we tap on these
end points of meridians

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:10%
of our body, we're actually
sending a calming signal

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:10%
to the amygdala in the brain.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And the amygdala, as
a lot of people know,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is that very ancient fight
or flight response center.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the part that,
historically, the tiger chases

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.137 align:middle line:84%
you, the amygdala fires,
the blood flows away

00:16:55.137 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
from the brain, from
the gut, so we can run.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
We can fight, we can flee.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Into the extremities--

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.144 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Exactly.

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:10%
One of the challenges
that we face

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:10%
in this very modern,
fast-paced life,

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:10%
is that, that amygdala,
that stress response,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:10%
is firing all the time.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.594 align:middle line:84%
And so, you get an email
from your boss at work

00:17:09.594 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting
at the computer

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and it stresses you
out and there's no

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:90%
running or fighting or fleeing.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.094 align:middle line:10%
That amygdala is
firing, the chemicals

00:17:17.094 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:10%
are coursing through the
body, cortisol is going up,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.953 align:middle line:10%
adrenaline is going up, and we
don't have a way to release it.

00:17:22.953 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:10%
In fact, if we have these stress
responses and we went for a run

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:10%
afterwards-- if we
sprinted right afterwards,

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:10%
that would be a
good healthy thing,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.132 align:middle line:10%
because that's what our
body would naturally do.

00:17:33.132 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To drain
the chemicals out.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: To drain the
chemicals, to actually use

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that energy that feels--
that's why people who exercise,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
go for a run, they find
it to be a massive stress

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:90%
reliever, for a good reason.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.814 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK: And what it's also doing
when we're tapping on these end

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:10%
points and meridians,
bringing up the stress

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:10%
response, whether it
be a current stressor

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:10%
or an old stress, an old trauma,
an old issue that's going on,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:10%
we're actually
retraining the brain,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:10%
retraining the memory of it.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we can do it
with veterans with PTSD who

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.969 align:middle line:10%

they think about it,

00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:10%
it's not even safe

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.468 align:middle line:90%
Their body clenches up.

00:18:05.468 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
There's so much pain.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
We can retrain that
memory, retrain

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
how it's stored in the body,

nothing there.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was in an car
accident a little while ago

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that I was
sitting at the same light

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that I was rear ended at.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
And there was a--

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I rolled my windows down--
this was several months later--

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:84%
a gust of wind came and it
shook the car and my whole body

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
went immediately into
the accident response.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK: And that's a conditioned
response in your body.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.034 align:middle line:10%
Now that's at a great specific
one that we can notice--

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:10%
same thing with
phobias and fears.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
If someone has a
real phobia, they

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
notice that
conditioned response.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:10%
But the reality is that,
that conditioned response

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:10%
is active in virtually
every part of our lives.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:10%
So when it comes to
weight loss and food,

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:10%
that conditioned
responses in place.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does
that work there?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Well it's the traumas.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's oftentimes the
traumas that we've

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:90%
experienced as we grow up.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's say-- and everybody's
story is different, but--

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I've heard things like
someone was 15 years old

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and they were
skinny and in shape

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and looking great and
their older sister said,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:84%
who do you think you
are looking so hot?

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And now it was like,
oh, right there--

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
body stores it's not
safe to look like this.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So now that conditioned response
is running all the time.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:10%
Any time you start
losing weight,

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.615 align:middle line:10%
often not a conscious thing,
oh, something doesn't feel good.

00:19:23.615 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel safe.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.406 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not safe.

00:19:25.406 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Same thing with finances
and standing out in the world.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:10%
The conditioned response--
why is it that so many of us

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:10%
go only so far and then
we just hit a wall and go,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:10%
uh-uh, I'm not doing this.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Why is it that--

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:90%
we talk about self sabotage.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:90%
We have a New Year's resolution.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
We have something we
want to make happen,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and we make a little
bit of progress,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and then go, no,
I'm not doing it.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you
really tap around say,

00:19:49.085 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
a New Year's resolution
to keep it active?

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Yeah, you
can, absolutely.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a great time to do it.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- defined because
you talked about the questions

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:90%
before, right?

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.322 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: It's really
about the questions

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:90%
that we ask ourselves.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.849 align:middle line:84%
And of the ways to do it on
our own is to say, OK, here's

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:90%
my New Year's resolution.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's to
lose 30 pounds.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So you write it down,
whatever you normally do.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.267 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next step is to
imagine it actually happening.

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So you close your eyes, you
have a little visualization,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK,
let's say in June,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I've actually lost
the 30 pounds.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And really pay attention
to what comes up.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, there'll be some good
feelings, like, oh, wow,

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:24.925 align:middle line:90%
I did this.

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And then if you pay
close attention,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:84%
there'll be some
negative feelings.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look for those.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.958 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Look for those.

00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:90%
There'll be things like--

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.385 align:middle line:84%
one of things that you can do
is have your family members

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and your friends
walk in the room

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
when you're running that
visualization, not in person,

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:90%
in that vision.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:10%
So you see yourself 30 pounds
lighter in your bathing suit

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.532 align:middle line:10%
and now you see all these people
you love walking into the room.

00:20:46.532 --> 00:20:47.573 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do they say?

00:20:47.573 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: How does that feel?

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:90%
What's that interaction like?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And people will
very quickly go, oh,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.895 align:middle line:84%
if something doesn't
feel safe about that.

00:20:55.895 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They'll notice
something alarming.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Exactly.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's that inquiry process.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.269 align:middle line:90%
Because when we see that--

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
not only can we actually
tap on that scene,

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
so we can actually
have the visualization,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and when we feel that
restriction, tap.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.586 align:middle line:84%
We can also ask ourselves the
questions, when did this start?

00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.477 align:middle line:84%
Really, what's
underneath this stuff?

00:21:13.477 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it
usually always go back

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to a childhood memory,
a trauma, something?

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: So many of
these things do.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.609 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Not always, sometimes
you'll find something

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
happened in your 20s
or 30s and everything

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.104 align:middle line:90%
was going great until then.

00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:30.395 align:middle line:84%
But all too often, and no
matter what the issue is-- we

00:21:30.395 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
could be talking about
finances and weight loss

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and relationships-- it'll
come back to mom and dad.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll come back to the things
that you heard growing up,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the things that you were told,
things that, oftentimes--

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of negative stuff
and a lot of pain and trauma

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and abuse, but there's also
stuff that would seem positive,

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
but we interpreted
it the wrong way

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.760 align:middle line:90%
or we felt too much pressure.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.501 align:middle line:84%
Our parents were
trying to help us out,

00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
but they put a lot
of pressure on us

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and now we've applied that
pressure to ourselves.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We can never stop
being a perfectionism.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:90%
We can never slow down.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:84%
We can never deeply
and completely

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:90%
love and accept ourselves.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Well I want to see--

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look at
what the tapping points are,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.628 align:middle line:84%
so you can learn a
little bit about that.

00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:08.847 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICK: So let's go
through the points

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
real quickly, so
that you know what

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
points we're talking about.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:84%
We start with a
karate chop point.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:90%
It's along the side of the hand.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And use your fingertips and just
tap on the side of your hand

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We will start here and do a
lot of tapping here while we

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:90%
make certain statements.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
During the dark
moments of your day,

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
what might you say about
your immune system?

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's failing me.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICK: It's failing me.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say is, even
though my immune system is

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
failing me right now, I deeply
and completely accept myself.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:90%
And we state that three times.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would then start
tapping on these other points.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And we use what's called
a reminder phrase.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me--

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just coming up
with something--

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
my immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Now when you're tapping--

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
if you were to imagine drumming
on a table and making a noise--

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that's about how much
pressure you want to use,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
so that you're really
connecting with the bone

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
underneath the tissue.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to--

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
some people really tap
hard thinking that's

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%
going to do a big difference.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make that
much difference.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, really intense
tapping, that's not necessary.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Some people tap in a circle.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Some people will pat their head.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You just gently tap
the top of the head.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:10%
Now it's just about the
center of your head.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So the eyebrow point is at
the beginning of your eyebrow.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's on both sides.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can tap
with both hands, one hand.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.669 align:middle line:84%
You can crossover--
doesn't really matter.

00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I feel like I want
a little more stimulation

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and I'll use both hands.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So the next point is
along the side of the eye.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not so close it makes
you blink and not so far back

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.278 align:middle line:84%
that you feel like
you're on your temple.

00:24:14.278 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It's really on the
bone right here.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Everybody got that?

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye point--

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a little sensitive, so
you don't want to bang on it

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:90%
real hard.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's right directly
below the pupil

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and just tap gently there.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I curl my lip down a little
bit when I tap under the nose,

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
cause I want to be able to
make it a little firmer.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.988 align:middle line:90%
You all right?

00:24:40.988 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It tickled?

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:90%
So try a little firmer--

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
a little firmer.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.974 align:middle line:84%
Chin-- it's not actually
down on the chin.

00:24:50.974 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
They call it the chin point.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:90%
It's in the crease here.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And just tap there.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Now the collarbone point--

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
the collarbone itself--
you have it on both sides.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's where the whole shoulder
attaches to your body.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So find that bone on
both sides, and then come

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
down about an inch into the
soft tissue right there.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:90%
These are under the arm points.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Now the underarm points is
not way up in the armpit

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
it's about mid bra line for
women, about hand width.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
If you start feeling very
emotional about anything that

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:90%
comes up, just start tapping.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're
going to notice--

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
every once in a while,
you can stop, take a look

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
at where your
intensity is on that,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.662 align:middle line:90%
and notice that it will shift.

00:25:40.662 --> 00:25:42.245 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now that
we know the points

00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:43.994 align:middle line:84%
and we know how to do
this and everything,

00:25:43.994 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
let's do some tapping
with the audience.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I know that you guys can
follow along at home.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Do this at home.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of the issues
that you hear the most that

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:90%
are a source of people's pain?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Yeah, so I sort
of see four big topics.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:90%
One is actual physical pain.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.427 align:middle line:84%
Physical pain and sort of
challenges in the body.

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
They could be other diseases or
other things that are going on

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:90%
from the physical perspective.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
struggle with finances.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And finances not only from
the debt side of things,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
but also from the making
more money side of things

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.875 align:middle line:84%
and being more fulfilled in
the world side of things.

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So breaking
into new realms.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: New realms and
really following our--

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.344 align:middle line:84%

00:26:22.344 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:90%
how can I follow my passion?

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
How can I actually be
financially successful,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
but make a contribution to the
world and be happy doing it?

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big one.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Relationships-- it's huge.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Intimate relationships--

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

It's an ongoing
issue-- really big.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:10%
And tapping works
really well with it.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For those that know
tapping and have been immersed

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.225 align:middle line:84%

maybe have followed your work

00:26:55.225 --> 00:26:58.084 align:middle line:84%
for awhile, what are some
of the advanced levels--

00:26:58.084 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
if you were to talk
to that person who's

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
been working with this
technique for a while,

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the nuances
that you use tapping for?

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Well, for myself, I
speak personally in my life,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I use it for procrastination

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:90%
finding balance and clarity.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I think tapping is
so great for clarity.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the challenges
that I have now,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I call them
high-quality problems.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, do I say yes
or no to this other speaking

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
engagement?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what an
incredible opportunity

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
you get to reach
these people, but I've

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
got to be on a
plane for six hours

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and do this, that,

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take care of your body.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Exactly.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of this
internal conflict

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of when do I take care of
myself and when do I do this?

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And I use tapping to just
gain that clarity on it

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to
make this the decision

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
clarity not impulse,

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
or not feeling like I need
to do more or I'm not this

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:90%

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.422 align:middle line:84%

You can either be

There's not a second that
someone just sits anymore

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:90%

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I get yelled at

But that's come from
a place of clarity,

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.987 align:middle line:84%
because if we are not

00:28:50.987 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
we feel like we need

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And that amygdala, that
little stress response

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:90%
is just firing all the time.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Little tiny stressors
add up in a big way.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what tapping
has been shown to do

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is to really move the
needle on the stress

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:90%
response in the body.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.236 align:middle line:90%
That is what it is proven to do.

00:29:07.236 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah, in a big way.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.384 align:middle line:90%
And move the needle--

00:29:09.384 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:84%
what I love about it is
that when you go deep,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
you're moving the needle
not just in that moment.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:90%
So I love yoga, for example.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:84%
You go do half an
hour, an hour of yoga,

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:90%
you feel great afterwards.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But then you go back
to work the next day,

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and you need to do it again.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not putting yoga down.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:90%

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:90%

But when you do the
tapping, when you

get to the underlying stuff--

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and yoga can do that as well.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.295 align:middle line:84%
Yoga can get to the
underlying stuff.

00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:84%
You go deep enough,
you clean stuff up.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:10%
But the tapping can very quickly
get to the underlying stuff,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:10%
so the stress just doesn't
naturally come up again.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:10%
You could be in the same exact
situation at work or at home

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:10%
with the family.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The external environment
might not have changed,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but you've retrain the
way your mind reacts.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can be a zen monk
about the situation,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.597 align:middle line:84%
or just take a
different perspective.

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've found
has happened in my life

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen it happen
in the lives of thousands

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:90%
of people around the world.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so can we
do a generic tapping on stress?

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Absolutely.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: On reducing
stress, I should say.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you're watching at
home, what we want to do--

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:90%
there's a couple simple steps.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
One, we want to pick
the target, the thing

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're working on.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And try to get
specific on one thing.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
You can go, even though
I'm really stressed,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and you'll feel
better afterwards,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
but then that's sort of like
doing the yoga stretches.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not going as
deep as we want to get.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So it is always good to try
to get specific on the issue.

>>LISA: A lot of chest
congestion, yeah.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: And how strong

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Oh my gosh, if we can
help this, that'd be great.

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's at about an eight.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%

So if you're at

00:31:31.461 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:84%
is pick either
pain in your body,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%
if you're experiencing it.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.021 align:middle line:84%
Pick some tightness in
your shoulder and tension.

00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:37.921 align:middle line:90%
Pick congestion.

00:31:37.921 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Just pick a place where
you're going to focus for now.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.545 align:middle line:84%
You want to use
the same language

00:31:41.545 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:90%
that Lisa and I are doing.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

We're going to focus

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:84%

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:84%
For time's sake, we're sort of
compressing a few things in.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.640 align:middle line:10%
Spending more time on
this, what I would say

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:10%
is to tap individually
on the things,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:10%
like how will they
feel about it?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.704 align:middle line:84%
That's called one
aspect of the issue.

00:39:19.704 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And so one aspect is
how will they feel?

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
hurt their feelings.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect is
what if I miss out?

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Another aspect is this.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we deconstruct
the issue like that,

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that's when we get
really great results

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:84%
because we handle the whole
issue not just one thing.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot of stuff that--

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:84%

everything has to be perfect

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.915 align:middle line:84%

hello to and yes to.

00:39:50.915 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: And again, those
are aspects of the issues.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is go
back and ask yourself,

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:90%
how did I learn these things?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:90%
What examples did she show me?

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And actually run the vision
of that perfect dinner table,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.780 align:middle line:90%
or what she said to you.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.810 align:middle line:84%
If she said, Lisa, you
know, you have to do x,

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.624 align:middle line:90%
or you have to do that.

00:40:09.624 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that she said
to you, whatever you learned,

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.100 align:middle line:84%
those are the core issues,
those are the core beliefs

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%

this challenge now.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:84%

You were right about that.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at Nick doing this

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.380 align:middle line:90%
with other people on stage.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a brilliant,
brilliant piece here.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:90%

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to
tap along together.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to-- just
move at your own pace.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%

actually tell me what happened.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%

>>AUDIENCE: A passenger-- well,
I told him to keep his foot in.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The other flight attendant
told him to keep his foot in.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, I told him for the
last time to keep his foot in,

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that's he's interfering
with my job.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.530 align:middle line:10%
And I went out to the
galley and was preparing

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:10%
to do some more catering,
and the call sign came on,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:10%

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.888 align:middle line:10%

And the way I fell, I injured
my arm, my whole left side.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:38.894 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer fly because I
can't perform the emergency--

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:58.971 align:middle line:90%
vehicles and everything--

00:44:58.971 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Well, we were
leaving late that afternoon,

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.325 align:middle line:90%
and then we were back Saturday.

00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you come back
because you realized that there

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:90%
was such an issue there?

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Well, in part, but we
also knew that at that moment,

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:84%
on that Saturday, I didn't have
a role in what was happening.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:84%
There was just other
mechanisms in place that--

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Needed to
play itself out.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But you did have an impact
a little bit later on.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.011 align:middle line:90%
About how long afterwards?

00:45:28.011 --> 00:45:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Well, I, actually, I
personally started making calls

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.477 align:middle line:84%
that Saturday afternoon
to tapping experts

00:45:33.477 --> 00:45:36.060 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, people that
I had connected with who I knew

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.890 align:middle line:90%
had done humanitarian work.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.600 align:middle line:84%
One in particular,
Dr. Lori Leyden

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.230 align:middle line:84%
who had been working in Rwanda
for the previous five years

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.436 align:middle line:84%
tapping with genocide
survivors in Rwanda

00:45:46.436 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:84%
with children who
had lost her siblings

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.410 align:middle line:90%
and their parents in Rwanda.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting,
because this

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:10%
work that I and the
tapping solution company

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.042 align:middle line:10%
had been supporting the
previous couple of years.

00:45:57.042 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We were excited about
what she was doing.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And we raised over
$250,000 for her work.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I called
her-- and she was

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.060 align:middle line:84%
in California at the
time-- and I said, look,

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:90%
here's what we have.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Newtown.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:90%
We've got to do something.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And she flew in that--
she was there by Tuesday.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:90%
So just a few days afterwards.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And we established the
Tapping Solution Foundation,

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.180 align:middle line:90%
established volunteers.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:90%
We've had about 40 volunteers.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We had hundreds of
applications for volunteers.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.166 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: 40 volunteers.

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And shortly, a week
after, we were already

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.570 align:middle line:84%
working with people,
tapping with people--

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
with first responders,
with parents

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.501 align:middle line:84%
who had lost their children,
with people in the school,

00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:90%
with people in the community--

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:84%
using this tapping technique
to deal with the stress

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and the trauma of the situation
to try to lighten the load.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So first responders--
let's start with those people.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Did you get a hold
of the Red Cross

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:90%
or the people that were there?

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we, actually,
from the beginning,

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:84%
we were very quiet about
the work we were doing.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a situation unlike
any the world has faced.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ever.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: One of the
things that happened

00:46:59.405 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
was that there was about
100-200-300 organizations who

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.130 align:middle line:90%
all went in to help.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:90%
That was their first response.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I read somewhere there were
68,000 Teddy bears sent in.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was
all this energy.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And we started slowly
working with people,

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.872 align:middle line:84%
but this is a new technique and
it's just now being accepted.

00:47:17.872 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:84%
There's psychologists
and psychiatrists use it,

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
but being extra accepted
by the mainstream.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want
to force our way in.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We knew, and I knew
personally, I live in the town.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:29.550 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to be here.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened-- we started
working with people right away,

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's really been
now 11 months later,

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:90%
where people are coming to us.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Just last weekend,
Lori presented

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:84%
in front of 100 Connecticut
counselors, the Connecticut

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Counselors Association, who
said we hear about the results

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:47.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're getting.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.207 align:middle line:90%
Teach us what you're doing.

00:47:49.207 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: We've
trained over 120, I

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.850 align:middle line:84%
think at this point,
psychologists, counselors,

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.190 align:middle line:90%
therapists in the town.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:57.314 align:middle line:90%
Our model is to not--

00:47:57.314 --> 00:47:58.980 align:middle line:84%
we can't handle all
the work ourselves--

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.938 align:middle line:84%
it's to train the people
in the front lines who

00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:90%
are doing this work.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're finding,
because sadly, the existing

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:84%
tools that are in
place just don't

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:90%
work for this level of trauma.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The tapping is
very effective for PTSD.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole study that's
been done about it at Harvard,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:19.464 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, Dawson
Church did it.

00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Yeah, Dawson
Church did it.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's showing very
clearly that it's getting

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:10%
to the root of this trauma.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
we're being called

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.110 align:middle line:84%
in by the traditional
therapists who are saying, look,

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.410 align:middle line:84%
we've been doing our best,
and well-intentioned,

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.537 align:middle line:84%
we're doing our best, but
nobody is getting better.

00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, people
are getting worse.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: So we're excited--

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.506 align:middle line:84%
not that people are
getting worse, obviously--

00:48:40.506 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but that people are recognizing
that the tapping can help.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.150 align:middle line:90%
So making a lot of progress.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now how
did you meet Scarlett?

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: So Scarlett Lewis,
who has become a dear friend,

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.320 align:middle line:84%
she lost her son, Jesse, in the
shooting-- six-year-old Jesse.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:90%
This brave, brave boy.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.450 align:middle line:10%
It came out afterwards
that he yelled

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:10%
run when Adam Lanza's gun
jammed and saved six kids

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and it's in the police report.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How did they know that?

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.576 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK: He was he was
in the classroom--

00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:09.310 align:middle line:10%
because the kids
that ran survived

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and said that it
was Jesse who knew,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.390 align:middle line:10%
at some level,
what was going on.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, Scarlett always
says that he's super smart kid

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and with it and just--

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Six?

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Six, yeah.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.860 align:middle line:84%
He knew that-- and he yelled
run when people were frozen.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.497 align:middle line:84%
And six kids lived
and he didn't make it.

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:28.330 align:middle line:84%
We were introduced to
Scarlett about a month

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
after the shooting
through a mutual friend.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, Scarlett
had been trying

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.950 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different things.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Well-intentioned people
giving horrible advice often.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.280 align:middle line:84%
She said she met with
someone and they said,

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I lost my son 14 years ago.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh my
gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and you will
never feel better again.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.244 align:middle line:84%
In that moment of tragedy,
in the moment of despair,

00:49:54.244 --> 00:49:55.660 align:middle line:84%
isn't helpful, as
well-intentioned

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:90%
as it might be.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she wrote a
book about her experience.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.390 align:middle line:90%
What was the story?

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Well, she had incredible
experiences after Jessie died,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.874 align:middle line:84%
things like finding a
chalkboard in her house.

00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:11.290 align:middle line:84%
She had this big,
long chalkboard,

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.780 align:middle line:84%
which I've seen in person,
and on it scribbled,

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.470 align:middle line:84%
they found weeks later, it
said nurturing, healing, love

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.080 align:middle line:84%
written by Jessie, at
some point, weeks earlier.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.710 align:middle line:10%
And you see very clearly
it's spelled phonetically.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not spelled right.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.697 align:middle line:90%
It's in his handwriting.

00:50:26.697 --> 00:50:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, let's take
a look at this, actually.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this
trailer here of the book.

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: We have so
many reasons to have

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the hearts filled with pain
in the world we live in.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is a woman here
in the audience today

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:47.930 align:middle line:84%
who is the mother of a
little boy named Jessie

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
who was shot down in
Newtown, Connecticut just

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.080 align:middle line:90%
a few months ago.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.770 align:middle line:84%
She has such an
amazing story to tell

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and has decided that
she is not going

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:90%
to have pain in her heart.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.614 align:middle line:84%
This is Scarlett Lewis,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:51:06.614 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SCARLETT LEWIS:
Thank you very much.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I love talking about Jesse.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I speak of Jesse in
the present tense,

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.610 align:middle line:84%
because I feel him all
around me, all the time.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.510 align:middle line:10%
When I was at the
firehouse, that day,

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.380 align:middle line:10%
waiting for my
child to come to me,

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.480 align:middle line:10%
and all the other
children had come and gone

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:10%
with their parents, and there
were a few of us waiting,

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.480 align:middle line:10%
we were scared.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And you kept holding out hope.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.920 align:middle line:10%
But when I began to
realize what had happened,

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:10%
I knew in my heart that Jesse
had done something brave,

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:59.120 align:middle line:10%
that if he was in spirit, he
had died trying to save someone.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.820 align:middle line:90%
So I carry this with me.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed at my mom's
for a couple of weeks.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It was too painful
to go to my own house

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:90%
with all the memories of Jesse.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks
after I was there,

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I noticed writing on my
chalkboard in my kitchen.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when
Jesse had written it,

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but it was shortly
before he died.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And it says, nurturing,
healing, love.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's phonetically spelled.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:30.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And written like a
six-year-old would write.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But it very clearly says
nurturing, healing, love.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's
a message for me,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.140 align:middle line:84%
a message for my
family and friends,

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.690 align:middle line:90%
but also for the world.

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Look at how everybody
responded to this tragedy.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It was in love, an
outpouring of love.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Sandy Hook chooses love.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like his spirit
is with me all the time.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I feel him all around.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And what a blessing it is for
me that I can see those gifts

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and I can accept them, and know
that he served his purpose,

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and he's here and
in heaven and whole.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.269 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you meet Scarlett?

00:53:23.269 --> 00:53:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Just through
a mutual friend.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:27.494 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Scarlett
had, surprisingly,

00:53:27.494 --> 00:53:29.660 align:middle line:84%
listened to a tapping world
summit a couple of years

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.120 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:32.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: She was
familiar with tapping.

00:53:32.013 --> 00:53:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And when a friend said Nick
Ortner lives in Newtown,

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.690 align:middle line:90%
she said, oh, my gosh.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was there with Dr.
Leyden just later that night.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It was like a rainy
Tuesday night,

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and we were just in her home
and actually tapped together

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that night, and have
worked together since.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, her son-- and this story
has always impacted me--

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:84%
they were rushing or late
or something that morning?

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Yeah, so they
were rushing to school,

00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:84%
as often happens I'm sure with a
six-year-old, and Jesse wrote--

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.070 align:middle line:84%
it was December 14th, so
it's cold in Connecticut--

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote in the frost
of the car, I love you

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.807 align:middle line:90%
and it had all these hearts.

00:54:08.807 --> 00:54:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, even though we're
late, I got to get the camera.

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:12.348 align:middle line:90%
I got to get a picture.

00:54:12.348 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last
picture she took of him.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: Right next
to I love you.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can't imagine.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And as strong as she
is and the story is--

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:24.960 align:middle line:90%
you said a story of hope.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:10%
I know a lot of people--

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm so passionate about this
book because-- her book--

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.740 align:middle line:10%
"Nurturing, Healing, Love,"
because it's a story of hope

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and know people
are scared of it.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like, I
can't even think about it.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Imagine.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: I can't even imagine.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.376 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
so much trauma there.

00:54:38.376 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:10%
But when you read the book,
you definitely shed tears.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.520 align:middle line:10%
But at the end, I
think that there's

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.965 align:middle line:10%
an awareness, a connection.

00:54:44.965 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe some
understanding.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK: An
understanding of what's

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.020 align:middle line:84%
going on here, and a deeper
understanding, and hope,

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and nurturing, and
healing, and love.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
are an inspiration

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to so many people
with what you've

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.120 align:middle line:84%
done in terms of bringing
tapping into the mainstream.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Now that we see how
it's working practically

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.480 align:middle line:84%
in the communities with deep
trauma, and also for someone

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.270 align:middle line:84%
like me with
congestion, it works

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:90%
in so many different ways.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
things, just try it.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no side effects.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Yeah.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
beautiful thing.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the difference that
it makes in people's lives

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.260 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: And it's so easy to use.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Experience it for a few minutes.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You can use it with
friends, family, kids.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It's so applicable.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.924 align:middle line:90%
It's a really powerful tool.

00:55:29.924 --> 00:55:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And
hopefully, in the show

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.577 align:middle line:84%
you saw, the history of it,
what to do, how to do it.

00:55:34.577 --> 00:55:35.660 align:middle line:90%
You've seen it work on me.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.460 align:middle line:90%
You saw it work on other people.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.545 align:middle line:84%
And the inspiration that
you've given us is wonderful.

00:55:40.545 --> 00:55:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being with me today.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK: Thank you, Lisa.

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for being with me.
